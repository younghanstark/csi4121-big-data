The Blues manager has been outspoken in his views regarding Chelsea's treatment by officials, even claiming there is a 'campaign' against the Stamford Bridge club. Earlier this week the club took an unusual step of posting an article on their official website claiming they had been awarded an 'abnormally low' number of penalties this season - just two in the Premier League.

Mourinho is admant he was not behind the article - but insisted he has not had any second thoughts about his stance against referees this season. 'Did I know about the article? No, I\u2019m just the first team manager,' said the Portuguese, whose side face Hull on Sunday. 'I never regret when I speak from my feelings, I never carry it, the consequences. 'Was I surprised to see article? No. Did I think it was opinionated? No. Not for me. 'I don\u2019t think the writer is going to win the Pulitzer with that article. It\u2019s just the numbers.

That won\u2019t change. 'The numbers always tell the truth. It\u2019s just pure numbers. 'No agenda, no intention. Just numbers.' Hull boss Steve Bruce was critical of Chelsea's players after the first clash between the two sides this season after two Chelsea players were booked for diving. Willian and Diego Costa both received yellow cards for simulation in the encounter, while Bruce called a Gary Cahill tumble in the area like something out of 'Swan Lake'. And when asked whether Bruce's comments in December has worked against Chelsea, the Blues boss added: 'I don't know, I don\u2019t speak about it. I can\u2019t. 'I\u2019m punished, I don\u2019t want to spend my energy thinking about the negative decisions and the points it cost us.

Two months to go and in two months we can be champions.'",

Captain Marvel joked that he was going to go to Madrid to try and tempt the Real winger back to Manchester at the launch of the United Legends match against Bayern Munich. Robson, 58, who will manage the United side, was responding to comments from Bayern counterpart Paul Breitner who claimed he was going to tempt Owen Hargreaves, who played for both sides, to represent Bayern in the Red Heart Charity match which raises money for the Manchester United Foundation. Bryan Robson joked he would try to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to play for Manchester United Legends . United face Bayern in the second leg of their Legends clash having drawn 3-3 in Munich last year . United's line-up for the June 14 clash will include Edwin van der Sar who will play for the club at Old Trafford for the first time since he hung up his gloves in 2011 in the second leg of this clash between \u00a0the legends of the two European superclubs. The Red veterans travelled to Munich in August 2014 for the first leg against their German counterparts, with goals from Paul Scholes and Andy Cole resulting in a 3-3 draw, so there is all to play for in the return match in June. Robson revealed that other figures from the club's recent history will also wear the red shirt again. Robson joked that he would try to tempt Cristiano Ronaldo back to Manchester for the game in June . Ronaldo recently returned to Old Trafford with his country Portugal for an international friendly in November . 'Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, Quinton Fortune and Denis Irwin too,' he said. 'The squad's coming together quite nicely and I'm happy with it.' Breitner reeled off a number of names he will have in his squad - Giovani Elber, Niko and Robert Kovac, Roy Makaay, Paulo Sergio, Michael Tarnat, Mark van Bommel, Daniel van Buyten and Dietmar Hamann. Robson added that he was hoping to see Old Trafford sold out. Edwin van der Sar has been confirmed for the game and will don a United shirt for the first time since 2011 . Paul Scholes is set to play after starring for United in the first leg which was a 3-3 draw at the Allianz Arena . Andy Cole is congratulated on the third goal in Munich by his team-mates, and United will want to win this time . 'The Legends game against Real Madrid in 2013 raised around \u00a31million for charity with a crowd of over 60,000,' he said. 'That was great but hopefully we can fill the stadium this time around. To raise that sum was brilliant for a one-off event and I think it\u2019s important to clarify all the lads play for nothing. 'Nobody gets paid for being involved and we know what sort of an impact the funds have on the community through the Manchester United Foundation.'",

With his side a goal to the good on a wet afternoon at Wembley Stadium, the Chelsea boss decided to have a bit of fun with a member of the TV crew by giving him a cheeky soaking with a water bottle. Known for having an overall good relationship with members of the press, Mourinho followed his prank with a\u00a0mischievous\u00a0smile towards his unlucky victim. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho takes aim and fires as he gives a camera man a soaking with a water bottle . With play going on in the background the Blues manager turned to squirt his unlucky victim with water . The Portuguese manager gives a cheeky smile to the television crew member after his prank at Wembley . And the smile continued on a successful outing for the Portuguese, as his side went on to beat Tottenham 2-0 to lift his first piece of silverware during his second stint in charge of the Blues. A goal from captain John Terry and an own goal from Spurs defender Kyle Walker handed Chelsea their fifth League Cup title, helping Mourinho get his hands on this particular cup for the third time in his managerial career. It was a solid performance from his men as they dampened Tottenham's week even further following their eviction from the Europa League on Thursday after defeat to Fiorentina.

Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer\u2019s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost \u00a3100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth . Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie\u2019s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: \u2018Of course we wanted to win. But it\u2019s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.\u2019 Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races. Arena Racing Company were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at Cheltenham . It doesn\u2019t say much for the commitment to developing homegrown cricket talent that England selector Mike Newell, in his other role as Nottinghamshire\u2019s director of cricket, has signed Zimbabwe batsman Brendan Taylor as a Kolpak player. The 29-year-old has played 23 Tests and 166 ODIs. The move follows another England selector, Middlesex boss Angus Fraser, bringing in New Zealander James Franklin on an Irish passport. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is a guest of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club at Cheltenham today. But Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to embrace the liquid Festival hospitality as heartily as one of her predecessors did last year. The former minister was barely able to walk through the car parks after the meeting. Minister for Sport Helen Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to end up like a predecessor at Cheltenham . LTA back in fat cat mode . LTA chief executive Michael Downey has yet to justify an annual salary and benefits package of \u00a3434,000 plus a massive one-off relocation payment of \u00a3190,000. Nor did the Canadian do his image much good by wearing a GB tracksuit top during last weekend\u2019s Davis Cup triumph over the USA in Glasgow \u2014 a cardinal sin for a sports administrator. LTA chairman David Gregson had said Downey would receive a \u00a3300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the Roger Draper regime are already in danger of being repeated. LTA chief executive Michael Downey was not his usual suited self in Glasgow - he wore a GB tracksuit top . There will be only five more racing days after Saturday before Clare Balding turns her back on presenting the sport following Royal Ascot. But the Balding effect has not boosted Channel 4\u2019s viewing figures \u2014 quite the reverse. The Cheltenham peak of 996,000 was down again on Wednesday, year on year, by 20,000. And the last time Cheltenham enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m-plus ratings was pre-Balding in 2012, when Highflyer produced the coverage and John McCririck, John Francome and Derek Thompson were all still on board. Clare Balding arrives at Cheltenham Festival, but her presence has not helped viewing figures . Only Cheltenham could consider \u00a330,000 for two season tickets in the Cheltenham Club good value. However, 100 of the 300 memberships available for the grand top-floor facility in the new \u00a345million grandstand, which are being sold on a minimum three-year basis, have already been bought. And that\u2019s where AP McCoy will be found at Cheltenham next year, having been signed up as the Club ambassador.

        "article": "The decision not to press charges over the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during an SAS training exercise was correct, prosecutors have confirmed. Edward Maher, Craig Roberts and James Dunsby died of heat exhaustion on the Brecon Beacons  after a 40-mile hike as part of a gruelling training exercise in July 2013. The Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing charges of gross negligence manslaughter but found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'. Corporal James Dunsby was among three soldiers that died after taking part in a training exercise on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, when temperatures reached 29C . Lance Corporal Edward Maher, 31, (left) was taken to hospital and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, (right) died on the mountainside . Prosecutors announced its initial decision not to press charges in July last year, but it is understood they were asked to re-examine the case by two of the soldiers' families. They were among 100 men taking part in a four-week trial for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists on Pen Y Fan, when temperatures hit 29C on July 13, 2013 - one of the hottest days of the year. Lance Corporal Roberts, 24, of Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, was pronounced dead on the mountainside, while Lance Corporal Maher and Corporal Dunsby, both 31, were taken to hospital. L/Cpl Maher died three hours later in Merthyr Tydfil's Prince Charles Hospital, while Cpl Dunsby, from Bath, was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and died on July 30. L/Cpl Roberts, who had served with the TA for more than five years and nicknamed 'CJ' by family, was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment. He is believed to have served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan and with United Nations peacekeepers in Cyprus. They were taking part in a gruelling selection process for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists on Pen Y Fan . L/Cpl Maher had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy lines. Cpl Dunsby was a member of the Army Reserves (The Royal Yeomanry). The Brecon Beacons are a notoriously inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both regular units and the special forces. A spokesman for the prosecution service said: 'The CPS Appeals and Review Unit has completed a review of the case relating to the tragic deaths of soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. 'This review was requested under our Victims' Right to Review scheme. 'Case reviews completed under the Victims' Right to Review scheme involve a completely independent assessment of the available evidence against the evidential and public interest standards set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. 'In this case, our review concluded that the original decision not to charge any individual in respect of this matter was correct. There is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction in this case. 'The families involved have been informed of this decision and the reasons for it. Our thoughts remain with them.' A large amount of detailed material, including reports provided by expert witnesses, was considered during the original review of the evidence, the CPS said. It is believed that two of the soldiers' families asked for the charges of\u00a0gross negligence manslaughter to be reviewed. The CPS found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction' A\u00a0Dyfed Powys Police spokesperson said: 'Following a joint police and Health and Safety Executive investigation into the events leading to the tragic deaths of three soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, files of evidence were submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service for review, who concluded that that there is insufficient evidence to support charges of gross negligence manslaughter. 'All families have been informed of the decision and police will continue to support them. 'Police will continue to support the Health and Safety Executive who continue with their investigation into the deaths. A file will be prepared for the coroner.' An inquest in to the deaths of soldiers was delayed after senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, ruled last September that a full inquest could not take place until after the CPS review of the deaths. The inquest, expected to last for up to three weeks, was rescheduled to begin on June 1. It is expected to hear from soldiers who were manning checkpoints at the time of the training exercise and other military personnel involved in its management.",

Praveen Siddannavar, 47, captured the stunning shots as the Indian bison, also known as gaurs, teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in the Karnataka State of India. The photographer, from Bangalore, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it. The chase: The group of Indian bison teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in India . On the prowl: The tiger was walking in the open, heading straight towards a water pipe where the group of bison were having a drink . On high alert: One of the gaurs picked up on the scent of the approaching tiger and made all the others aware of its presence . Speaking of the incident, Mr Siddannavar said: 'I was enjoying a late afternoon drive and after scanning the forest and I drove to the sunset point on the backwaters of river Kabini that had gone completely dry due to poor monsoons'. 'I was fortunate to spot a huge tiger resting underneath the shade of dried bamboo bushes,' he added. 'After a while the tiger started walking in the open and loud alarm calls were given by spotted deer and also the Sambar deer. The tiger ignored these calls and headed straight towards the culvert [water pipe] to cool himself in a puddle,' he went on to say. Mr Siddannavar said that a herd of gaurs were heading the same way to quench their thirst - a sight that 'really excited' him as he knew he was going to see some action. One of the gaurs then picked up on the scent of the tiger and they were all alerted. 'The gaurs seemed uncomfortable upon seeing the tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack,' the photographer said. Not going easy: The gaurs were uncomfortable at the presence of the massive tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack . Running scared: As soon as the four Indian bison charged at their would-be killer, the tiger decided he wasn't going to hang around . Filled with fear: The four bison chased the tiger, who seemed more interested in saving his own life than making a kill . Mr Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs  stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively. As soon as the animals charged, the photographer said, their would-be killer decided to run away.' The photographer admitted he was stunned to see the tiger backing away from its prey and said the gaurs proved to be a formidable force. 'What an unbelievable sight this was - I have never seen such action-packed drama before,'\u00a0Mr Siddannavar said. 'Tigers are apex predators - meaning they are at the top of the food chain in the forest ecosystem,' he added. Great defence: Praveen Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively . Safe: After being chased away from the scene, the tiger went back to sheltering under the safety of dry bamboo trees . All in a day's work: After seeing off the tiger, the gaurs wandered off into the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, in India's Karnataka State . Mr Siddannavar said gaurs are not normally scared of other animals, but taking on a tiger showed particular unity, strength and bravery. 'Tigers hunt gaurs regularly but it was amazing to see them working together - their strength lies in numbers and unity plays a key role in fending a tiger away,' he said. 'It really surprised me to see the tiger running away as tigers rarely back off as they are the kings of the jungles,' he added. 'But because it was a group of four gaurs and they attacked from all ends, the tiger had no option but to run away to save his life.' Photographer: Praveen Siddannavar, 47, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it .",

Donnie Loneman, 59, had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade when doctors gave him three weeks to live. Loneman, who had loved being a Marine, asked for three things: to be buried in dress blues, with a 'high and tight' Marine haircut and a corps flag for his casket. Scroll down for video . Donnie Loneman, a homless Marine who had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade, requested that he be buried in dress blues after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer . Loneman, 59, also asked to be given a Marine 'high and tight' haircut and to be buried with the corps flag . The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair Medical Center put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. A flag and the dress blues were donated, and the foundations also paid for Loneman's funeral expenses and gave him an honor guard for his burial, according to KOCO-TV. Loneman, who was Native American, was beloved by the local veteran affairs organization, who knew him to have 'a good heart' and a 'great sense of humor'. 'We get guys like him once in a blue moon, who really make a difference for everyone here,' said Christine Cleary, who worked with the medical center. The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. His funeral was also paid for and he received an honor guard for his burial . Even as the organization fought to get Loneman off the street, he would say the aid should be given to a veteran who needed more help than him. As one friend recalled in a letter, Loneman had grit. When she worried about him living out in the cold he simply responded that Marines are tough. 'We can take it,' she recalled him saying. 'We can take anything.' Loneman wasn't even afraid of death. He told Cleary he was happy because he knew he was going to heaven, where he would get to see his mother and the Marines. 'He said \"I'm going to enter the gates, and I'm going to tell all the Marines that are standing there that they're relieved of their duty, and I'm going to take their place\"', Cleary recalled him saying. 'And I'll stand there until my arm gets tired, and another Marine comes.' Loneman, who was Native American, was beloved by the local veteran affairs organization, who knew him to have 'a good heart' and a 'great sense of humor'",

        "article": "Disturbing questions were being asked last night about four judges caught looking at pornography at work. Fearing a cover-up, MPs and legal experts want to know whether the four were looking at X-rated material while presiding over trials. Two are known to have overseen cases in which the charges related to pornography or sex offending. Three were viewing explicit material in their chambers. Andrew Maw, left, resigned before he could be sacked while Immigration judge Warren Grant, right, \u00a0confirmed today he lost his job for viewing porn on official judicial equipment . But senior judges and the judicial disciplinary board refused to give any detail about the \u2018inappropriate\u2019 activities of the judges. And officials declined to say whether criminal charges had been considered or whether their summary departures will affect their judicial pensions. A criminal charge of misconduct in public office can be brought when a public officer \u2018wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public\u2019s trust\u2019. London immigration judge Warren Grant, district judge Timothy Bowles of Romford county court and recorder Peter Bullock, who worked on the north-eastern circuit, were all sacked for viewing pornographic material. Recorder Andrew Maw, who worked at Lincoln county court, resigned before he could be forced out. An official statement said he had \u2018viewed similar inappropriate material via his judicial IT account\u2019 and would have been removed from office \u2018had he not resigned before the conclusion of the disciplinary process\u2019. David Green, a criminologist at the Civitas think-tank, said: \u2018We need to know what kind of cases they were dealing with and whether the material they were looking at was relevant to those cases. That is how their behaviour could have become a matter of conduct in office. \u2018The issue is: What do we know about the cases they were hearing? This could be important for the administration of justice. Sex scandals being regularly unearthed have made us all suspicious about the behaviour of public officials.\u2019 Recorders are qualified to preside over crown court criminal trials. But the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which handles disciplinary complaints against judges and magistrates, refused to give any information about the misconduct or the cases the judges dealt. This means no one can know whether their judge was watching pornography during recesses in their own case or whether cases that might have involved complicated sexual issues were being run by a judge who was using pornography in his office during the trial. The dismissal of so many judges in one day \u2013 and behind closed doors \u2013 provoked disquiet in Westminster and among legal experts. Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who campaigns for open justice, said: \u2018I am concerned about the lack of transparency in the running of the judiciary. We know little about what happened here, but it was considered serious enough for the judges to be dismissed. This is one key aspect of concern over transparency in the judiciary.\u2019 Sacked: Three judges have been fired and one resigned after being caught watching porn on work computers . Tory MP Dominic Raab said: \u2018It is a cardinal rule that British justice is not just done, but also seen to be done. Those upholding the law need to be held to similar standards of transparency and accountability.\u2019 One of the four judges jailed a teacher for downloading child pornography and another sentenced a Peeping Tom for using a mobile phone to film women in swimming pool changing rooms. A statement from the Investigations Office said the three men \u2018have been removed from judicial office following an investigation into an allegation that they viewed pornographic material on judicial IT equipment in their offices.\u2019 It said the judges were not linked in any way. The statement added that \u2018the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content, but concluded that this was an inexcusable misuse of their judicial IT accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for a judicial office holder\u2019. The sackings came less than two months after the Lord Chief Justice told MPs of the seriousness with which he regards \u2018extreme\u2019 pornography. Lord Thomas told the Commons justice committee he believed a recent murder case illustrated \u2018that the peddling of pornography on the internet had had a dramatic effect on an individual\u2019 and that is what is available now to download and to see \u2026 is simply horrific\u2019. The secretive disciplinary process culminated in the dismissal rulings by Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who make the final decision when serious allegations are made against judges or magistrates. No details were given about how the allegation of viewing pornography on office computers came to be made against judges in four different courts. There was speculation the judges\u2019 misuse of office computers could have been noticed as part of security checks of IT systems. The disciplinary process run by the JCIO was revamped in 2013 when the organisation ceased to be known as the Judicial Complaints Office. It has 15 staff, headed by Judith Anckorn, and took disciplinary action in 58 cases from more than 2000 referred to it in the 2013/14 financial year. Judges may be called in to supervise investigations, and judges who are facing serious allegations have a right to be heard by a disciplinary panel, which is held behind closed doors. Yesterday\u2019s statement said that the pornography viewed by the judges did not have illegal content, but it did not say whether other criminal charges were considered in their cases. The action against the judges is not thought to have included measures to curb or confiscate their pension entitlement. An immigration judge in London currently earns an annual salary of \u00a3121,450 and a district judge commands \u00a3115,489. The judicial pension scheme has long offered equivalent to half the judge\u2019s salary after 20 years of service. They sat in judgment over sex offences . One of the four disgraced judges once jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography. Matthew Curtis was arrested after the FBI found he had paid two American sellers for child porn in 1999. The teacher at Bourne Grammar School in Lincolnshire said he was not responsible for the 17 images found on his school computer. But ANDREW MAW jailed Curtis for eight months in 2004 and told him: \u2018Were it not for these matters, I am sure you would have risen high up in your chosen profession. \u2018It is only by your actions that you have thrown it all away.\u2019 Mr Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court at the time. He retired from the bench in September, before the investigation into the misuse of his own computer was concluded. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said he would have been sacked had he not retired. Mr Maw, 66, a married father of three, lives in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The former judge was admitted as a solicitor in 1973 and was appointed a recorder in 2000. Mr Maw attended the former Wintringham Grammar near Grimsby. Andrew Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court (pictured) in 2004 when he jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography . He was chairman of the Grimsby Everyman Club. He was also a member of the Grimsby St James Rotary Club before relocating to Lichfield. He was most recently recorder at Lincoln county court, dealing with civil and family cases, but also sat on criminal cases at the crown courts in Derby and Grimsby. Another of the disgraced judges, PETER BULLOCK, once banned a pervert from swimming pools after he was caught filming women undressing on his mobile phone. He ordered the offender not to enter any municipal pools and gave him a three-year community order. Mr Bullock, 70, was a deputy district judge and recorder on the north-eastern court circuit before his dismissal. The father of two lives in Cramlington, a small town in Northumberland. He refused to comment at his detached \u00a3275,000 home yesterday. A relative said: \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to talk.\u2019 The third judge sacked for viewing porn on his work computer said he had been suffering from \u2018severe and undiagnosed depression\u2019 at the time. WARREN GRANT, 60, a married father of five, was an immigration judge in London and believed to be earning \u00a3128,000 a year. In a statement released yesterday, he said: \u2018I do not wish to comment save to say that for some years before, and during, the period covered by the conduct which formed the subject of the complaint laid against me I was suffering from severe and undiagnosed depression. I request that the privacy of my family and myself be respected so that we are allowed to continue with our lives.\u2019 Mr Grant lives in Golders Green, North London. He attended the independent Royal Grammar School in Newcastle before studying law at St Catherine\u2019s College, Cambridge. He speaks five languages including French and Hebrew and also plays in a jazz band. TIMOTHY BOWLES, 53, was a district judge at Romford county court. District judges are full-time officials who deal with a range of family and civil cases.",

        "article": "Last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for Dorothy Perkins in Newcastle and today she's modelling her summer range, so is Amy Childs Essex's most successful export? It would appear so. The beautician-turned-designer, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there's just no stopping her. Speaking to FEMAIL about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses, peplums, strappy tops, and feminine blouses, Amy, 23, said: 'I\u2019ve really branched out for SS15. 'I wanted to give more options for all the girls out there who are going on holiday, going out, going to a lovely spring wedding - all of those things.' Scroll down for video . Amy Childs has unveiled her new springtime collection of shape-enhancing dresses that she designed for a holiday romance . She continued: 'I wanted to give the lovely ladies something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters. I always sit down and think about what everyone wants in a collection, I look on twitter, ask my friends and my mum and look at trends. It\u2019s a long process but I love it.' Amy has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional, she says that behind closed doors she'd love to go wild with her style. 'I\u2019d love to be a style chameleon,' she said. 'I\u2019m always looking in magazines at celebrity style and campaign shots. I style my friends sometimes and they style me; I love trying new things.' Amy says that she wanted to give the 'lovely ladies' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she's been thinking long and hard about her new designs . While her former TOWIE co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood and would love to dress Khloe Kardashian and Dakota Johnson in her designs . Despite her successes, Amy still believes that, like Victoria Beckham, it's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry. 'I\u2019ve tried hard to break out of that TOWIE box and I think I\u2019ve done that,' she said. 'I was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as \"Essex\", but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about and my collection is for everyone; I don\u2019t just design for TOWIE fans.' While her former co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood. 'I\u2019d love to dress Dakota Johnson,' she admitted. 'She\u2019s so stunning. She has such striking features that she can really have fun with her fashion and still look elegant. Khloe Kardashian is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning. I would love to have her in one of my dresses; she would look amazing.' Amy believes that, like Victoria Beckham, it's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry . Amy  loves looking at celebrity style and campaign shots for design inspiration and loves to style her friends . For now, Amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some 'sun, sea and sangria'. 'I\u2019m really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends \u2013 I spend most of the year being businesswoman Amy so it\u2019ll be nice to kick back and just be fun Amy,' she said. 'I go on holiday with my best friend usually; I would love to share it with someone special though, maybe in the future?,' she teased. She does, however, admit that men 'definitely' struggle to approach her because of who she is. She said: 'Some of my guy friends say they\u2019ve heard that guys have not come and said \"hi\" to me as they were intimidated. I don\u2019t get it though.' So what kind of relationship is Amy looking for? 'One like the Beckhams',' she said. 'They have their own businesses and things going on yet they still make time for each other to be a family. That\u2019s the perfect relationship: still doing what you love and having that person to come home to.' Amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some 'sun, sea and sangria'",

        "article": "New pictures have been released revealing the ordeal of Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up\u00a0Andressa Urach who was\u00a0hospitalised at the weekend after her buttock implants became infected. Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of\u00a0perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her\u00a0voluminous\u00a0bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less\u00a0curvaceous\u00a0rear if it\u00a0means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering\u00a0in her\u00a0hospital\u00a0bed with her hands making\u00a0a\u00a0heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an\u00a0advocate\u00a0of cosmetic\u00a0surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. The model pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com after her legs were infected . Andressa, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . She spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . This graphic photos show gaping holes in Andressa's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Andressa featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'",

        "article": "A married New Jersey English teacher was indicted Wednesday on charges that she engaged in improper relationships with three of her male students, including having an alleged sexual relationship with one of them. Nicole McDonough, 32, of Mount Olive, was arrested December 30 on suspicion of having sex with an 18-year-old student while\u00a0employed as a teacher at Mendham High School. However a subsequent investigation now sees her facing three charges of official misconduct, with prosecutors saying McDonough engaged in\u00a0improper 'communication' and 'fraternization' with two other male students, who were also 18. Prosecutors did not elaborate on the kind of fraternizing the mother-of-two allegedly took part in. Indicted: High school English teacher Nicole McDonough - seen here at her first court appearance in January - was indicted Wednesday on charges of engaging in improper relationships with three her male students, all 18, including having an alleged sexual relationship with one of them . According to The Daily Record, the alleged sexual relationship occurred in April, May, and June of 2013. The relationships with the other two students then allegedly occurred in April, May, and June of 2014. Additionally, NJ.com have reported that McDonough does not face any sex charges because all three alleged victims were 18. The prosecution made it clear they believe she was only sexual with one of the boys. The indictment outlined that McDonough committed second-degree official misconduct because she 'did commit acts relating to her office, but constitutionally unauthorized exercises of her official functions'. Charged: Nicole McDonough (above) was arrested in December after reportedly having sex with an 18-year-old student. An investigation found she had 'improper relations' with two others, police say . McDonough did so 'with the purpose to obtain a benefit for herself, specifically emotional, mental and/or physical sexual gratification', the indictment said. Timothy Smith, McDonough's attorney, said Friday he would seek to have the indictment dismissed and called it a 'rogue prosecution' that incorrectly applies official misconduct laws. Official misconduct is punishable upon conviction by up to 10 years in prison with a minimum of five years to be served before parole consideration. Scene: McDonough, a married mother of two, worked as an English teacher at\u00a0West Morris Mendham High School in Morristown, New Jersey . According to NJ.com, McDonough 'teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses at the high school' and 'holds a bachelor's degree in English Literature from the College of St. Elizabeth.' Describing herself on the school's website she writes; 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter.\u00a0I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.' She closes by saying; 'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!' Authorities have not released any of the student's names.",

Hamilton is the favourite to defend his championship with Mercedes expected to hold a clear advantage over the rest of the field when the season gets underway in Melbourne in the early hours of Sunday morning. The 30-year-old Briton has brushed shoulders with a host of A-List celebrities during the off-season as he continues to expand his profile outside of the sport. Lewis Hamilton is pictured on St Kilda beach on Thursday as he prepares to defend his Formula One title . The Briton faced the media in the first pre-race press conference of the year ahead of the Australian GP . He is also close to signing a new deal with Mercedes which will see him earn a considerable amount more than the current \u00a320million-a-year contract he signed after leaving McLaren in 2012. Meanwhile, his private life has also been the subject of much discussion following the break-up of his relationship with long-term girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, the American popstar who was in Abu Dhabi to celebrate his second world championship last year. \u2018Lewis appears to be going through a transition in his off-track life,\u2019 said Coulthard, a 13-time race winner. \u2018I see he is negotiating his own contract, doing music in the future and has split up with Nicole, and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative. \u2018It will be interesting to see now that he has won two world titles, is a wealthy champion, and got lots of opportunities, whether the absolute focus is still on the job.\u2019 Hamilton signs autographs for fans at the Albert Park Circuit. He starts the season as championship favourite . David Coulthard, pictured on Thursday, believes Nico Rosberg will return stronger this season . Rosberg will renew his title battle with Hamilton . Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg are set to go toe-to-toe for the world championship once more after the dominant Mercedes pair won 16 of the 19 races last season during a frenetic campaign. Hamilton clinched the title in dramatic circumstances at the season finale in Abu Dhabi with his 11th victory of the year. But Coulthard expects the German, who tasted victory just once after his collision with Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, to return stronger this term. \u2018Nico now has the experience of battling for a world championship,' added Coulthard. 'He went into last year with a good car, everything was going great, then he had the collision in Spa, his team told him he was a bad boy, and he was getting booed by the fans. 'There were so many first-life experiences for him and a lot of things he had to go through. 'I think he will be stronger. He is settled in his life, he is married and he has got a baby coming later in the year.\u2019 The F1 season kicks off with the Australian GP on Sunday 15 March.

It was the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living residents, who are all in their 80s and 90s, who came up with the idea for a charity calendar that showed a little bit of skin. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, said the residents were inspired by a similar calendar another retirement center nearby had done. Wilma Purvis and Norma Elfrink were the centerfold for the stripped down charity calendar made by residents of the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living facility in Barberton, Ohio . 'They were so cute about it,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful.' Morris said the only thing her mother, who was Miss July, was worried about was getting her hair done before the shoot. The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an\u00a0appropriate\u00a0holiday\u00a0theme. Miss February, 87-year-old Dottie Rutter, lies in a bubble bath covered in rose petals as she enjoys a box of chocolates to honor Valentine's Day. The 98-year-old Maxine Garden, who  passed away after the shoot, can be seen smiling behind a large exercise ball, happy bare (almost) all in the facility's gym. The calendar's centerfold is Wilma Purvis, 94, and Norma Elfrink, 91, playing a game of poker with some very large cards - not to mention Coronas and cigars. Miss October Jean Genet (right), 90, told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said . Lifetime Barbertown resident and Miss October Jean Genet, 90, was a housewife before moving into Pleasant Pointe. She told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked. 'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said. She said none of the models said no to the shoot in December and that she 'felt glamorous' after taking off her clothes to pose in a witches hat. Mrs Genet was sad that her husband, who died in November, did not get to see the calendar. However, she said her whole family, which includes five daughters, 14 grandchilden and 30 great-grandchildren, have picked up copies. 'They can't believe that's grandma,' she said. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, told the Daily Mail Online the calendar 'wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful' The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme . Pleasant Pointe spokesperson Michelle Clapper said the residents were 'very excited' to be a part of the charity calendar, she told the Akron Beacon Journal. She said they were 'like 20-year-olds' on the morning of the big shoot, giggling and 'having the time of their lives'. 'I do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other,' she said. 'I want a fun environment. I love supporting their independence.' 'I wanted them to decide what they wanted to do,' said Morris. 'That's what we're here for.' Proceeds from the calendars, which are selling for $12, will held provide shoes for children who attend schools in the area. The residents recently donated $2,000 to the fund. Pleasant Pointe says that it has had to order more calendars to keep up with demand, according to WKYC. None of the residents had ever done any sort of naked modeling before.

But the image of an incredibly overloaded delivery bike still manages to boggle the mind of anyone who sees it. Captured cycling through the streets of Shanghai, two men are shown carrying a ridiculously large load of seven huge boxes of paper. Parked, the two bikes are dwarfed under the load of the seven boxes that they each carry . Straining under the weight of the cargo the three-wheeled bikes can be heard groaning as the riders go about making their delivery. Despite being dwarfed by the extremely heavy load, the riders move relatively fast towards their destination. Filmed parked at the side of the road after arriving, one of the bikes is shown toppled backwards under the weight of the boxes. One of the bikes moves relatively quickly considering the size and weight of its load . The pair are then seen untying the rope around the boxes before offloading the paper onto the street. Pulling the rope from the top, one man manages to put his bike back on all three wheels before he attempts to remove the highest stacked box. Because of China\u2019s huge population, many locals have adopted this means of transport as a way of getting around effectively. Pushbikes, motorbikes, mopeds and scooters are all used in place of transit vans and HGVs as a way of avoiding the congestion.

        "article": "You can search far and wide for the answer to a problem, but sometimes it is right under your nose. When Arsene Wenger sent Francis Coquelin on loan to Charlton in November it looked to be the final nail in the Frenchman's Arsenal career. The Gunners manager admitted as much recently, revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in December. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin (right) controls the ball during his side's win against QPR . The Frenchman wore a protective mask at Loftus Road after fracturing his nose against Everton . Coquelin, pictured challenging Sandro, has become the Gunners' midfield enforcer in recent months . But a spate of injuries in midfield saw Wenger recall Coquelin in December. The 23-year-old hasn't looked back. He's grasped his chance to become a key member of Arsenal's midfield with both hands, despite his reluctance to return to Arsenal from Charlton fearing he'd simply be warming the bench. There's an argument to suggest he's the most vital component in Wenger's plans at the present moment; the central midfield enforcer they've been crying out for in recent years. Just weeks after his Arsenal career looked to be drawing to a close, Coquelin is on the verge of agreeing a new long-term contract to stay at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger would like to say Coquelin's emergence has been pre-planned; a managerial masterstroke that has helped Arsenal turn their stuttering league form around. But that is far from the case. Coquelin played five games on loan at Charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular . Coquelin's stint in the first team has earned him a new long-term contract with the Gunners . The Frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot Mathieu Flamini in the pecking order . Following three substitute appearances after his return from the Valley, Coquelin was handed a rare start against West Ham on December 28 in place of the injured Mathieu Flamini. He hasn't looked back. His energetic and mature displays alongside Santi Cazorla in central midfield have been a revelation - none more so than in the win at Manchester City in January. The concern with Coquelin has always been about his physical stature. Can his slender frame handle the rough and tumble of Premier League football? He's answered those questions unequivocally in recent weeks. Having fractured his nose in the recent win over Everton, the midfielder insisted upon playing on - only coming off in injury time after taking another blow to the face. Three days later he was back on the pitch, sporting a protective mask, in the narrow win over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. He's waited so long to prove himself in an Arsenal shirt, Coquelin's won't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger admitted that he was willing to let Coquelin leave the club before his return . Wenger is still interested in Southampton's defensive midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) Coquelin, pictured in training, still needs to convince Wenger that he can play for Arsenal long-term . The big question is whether Coquelin is the long-term answer to Wenger's holding midfielder conundrum. After failing to sign an enforcer last summer, the Gunners will be back in the market for a midfield ball winner once more at the end of the season despite Coquelin's emergence. Morgan Schneiderlin, for the time being, is favourite to land the role provided Arsenal can strike a deal with Southampton, who will want at least \u00a325milliom. That would leave Coquelin's regular place in Wenger's team selections under threat. For now Coquelin will be focusing on keeping his place in the team until the end of the season. The returns of Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere following injury spells will cast further questions over the Frenchman's role. But, for now, the shirt is Coquelin's to lose. Having waited so long for this chance - he'll be desperate to keep it that way.",

And in a move that could slash arrests for public urination in Surfers Paradise, Gold Coast council are considering applying a coat of waterproof paint to walls there. It'll be spray-back time for drunken revellers as the council is copying the German party city of Hamburg which has painted the walls of its entertainment district with the same sort of paint used on ships to deter party-goers from peeing in public. The\u00a0Gold Coast Bulletin\u00a0reported that the local council will look into introducing the move where the paint bounces the offending stream off the wall and back onto the offending person. Scroll down for video . Open-air urinals may have given some people a laugh but they proved unpopular in Surfers Paradise . A neon animation shows how easy it was to pee without payback before (left) compared to after (right) due to the application of hydrophobic paint to walls in St Pauli, Hamburg . Public urination ouside Surfers Paradise's nightspots has caused problems for the Gold Coast council . Open-air \u00adurinals had been used on a trial basis in Surfers Paradise but they were panned by the public. 'It was PR disaster but in keeping urine off the footpaths, it worked really well,' Surfers councillor Lex Bell\u00a0said. He said the waterproof paint idea was 'very interesting' and that he would take it to council officers for consideration. Nightclub and bar owners in Surfer's Paradise said the council would be better off just providing public toilets. This local resident registered his displeasure with the situation in the\u00a0St Pauli Interest Community video . Liquid poured on one half of a breeze block coated with water-repellent paint runs off in this demonstration . St Pauli Interest Community members have put up warning signs - put not every painted wall has them . Hollywood Showgirls strip club owner Craig Duffy offered to pay for the installation of public toilets in a disused basement underneath his Surfers Paradise nightspot. Mr Duffy wrote to council in January offering 600sqm of underground space for public loos which he\u2019d rent back to council at a market rate - but he\u2019s yet to hear a response, the Gold Coast Bulletin said. 'That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all. It\u2019s utterly insane. $116 a square metre? Pardon the pun but it\u2019s money down the toilet,' he said of the pee-proof paint. 'It\u2019s not dealing with the underlying problem at all which is that there are no toilets.' But using waterproof paint on walls in Hamburg has worked. Here residents of the pub-heavy area at the heart of the party town made a stand against so-called\u00a0'Wildpinkler', which literally means 'free pee-ers' in German. Members of the St Pauli Interest Community (IG St Pauli) fed up with drinkers weeing everywhere from back alleys to underpasses to childrens' playgrounds used a special paint to give them a nasty surprise. Water droplets bounce right off the hydrophobic paint with which the residents have coated dozens of walls across a district which welcomes 20 million often heavy-drinking party guests every year. A man relieving himself in the street jumps back in horror when he gets splash back from the special paint . So-called\u00a0'Wildpinkler', or 'free pee-ers', have even been caught urinating in playgrounds in St Pauli . Now public urinators will get splash back on their shoes and clothes if they decide to empty their bladders in the street. IG St Pauli board member and owner of several local bars Uwe Christiansen told\u00a0The Local: 'It was a real annoyance that was growing and growing. 'We wanted to bring people to reason.' St Pauli's red light district. The area of Hamburg gets 20 million often heavy-drinking visitors every year .",

The victory came at a cost with Sergio Busquets taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the first half after a bad challenge to his right ankle from Tomas Pina.

Neymar got the first and the third with Barcelona running out 6-2 winners on aggregate. Neymar celebrates giving Barcelona an early lead in the second leg against\u00a0Villarreal .

There were 20,000 yellow balloons in Villarreal\u2019s tiny Madrigal Stadium at kick-off with the intention of creating a atmosphere of belief among the home supporters. Between them Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar went about bursting most of them after just three minutes. Suarez found Messi with a superb cross-field pass from the left and Messi played an even better ball to find Neymar through the middle. The Brazilian beat Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo to the ball to put Barcelona one up. It was Neymar\u2019s 25th goal of the season and the tenth that has come from a Messi pass but strangely it didn\u2019t kill the tie.

Pina then passed to Uche who sliced his finish into the side-netting. Cheryshev then forced another save from Ter Stegen from a similar position. Barca had their chances too with Messi producing a pass that was almost identical to the one that had brought about the opening goal this time for Iniesta who couldn\u2019t get his shot away before Victor Ruiz made the block. But Villarreal continued to find space in behind Barcelona and six minutes before half time they got the equalizer. It was a bad 60 seconds for Barcelona. Pina followed through on a pass and went straight through Busquets\u2019s right ankle. With the midfielder still down Villarreal raced away and Costa crossed from the right for Jonathan Dos Santos to finish past Ter Stegen. Barcelona's Sergio Busquets lies on the ground injured during the game . Busquets is carried off on a stretcher after his injury in the first half . Busquets was carried off on a stretcher and now needing just the two goals to draw level Villarreal went down the tunnel at half time believing they could pull off a shock. They could have got the first of those goals with their first chance of the second half but Vietto\u2019s header did not trouble Ter Stegen.

A yoga teacher with new breast implants flashed them at guests at a bar mitzvah and let underage boys fondle them before performing a sex act on a 15-year-old boy, police have said. Lindsey Ann Radomski, 32, told police in Scottsdale, Arizona that she was too drunk to remember what happened at the party on Saturday night. She was among 80 to 100 guests at the party when she allegedly exposed her new breasts to five adults and they told her to 'sleep it off',\u00a0Sergeant Ben Hoster told The Arizona Republic. She then went to a pool area, where she flashed juveniles, police said. In the early hours of Sunday morning, while most of the guests were asleep or had gone home, she allegedly invited seven boys, aged 11 to 15, into a bedroom and let them fondle her breasts. When all of the children apart from a 15-year-old boy had left, she performed a sex act on him, the teenager told police. The victim's parents learned of the encounter and went to the police, Hoster said. Radomski, who teaches yoga in the Scottsdale area, was interviewed on Tuesday. She told authorities that she had been too drunk to remember the incident but did admit to flashing.

Labour yesterday admitted it will borrow billions more than the Tories \u2013 as experts warned the party\u2019s plans would leave a \u00a330billion black hole at the heart of the nation\u2019s finances. Ed Miliband\u2019s elections chief Lucy Powell confirmed the party \u2018may use some investment borrowing\u2019 to fund its manifesto if it wins the election. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour\u2019s plans would potentially leave Britain with a permanent budget deficit \u2013 piling up massive debts for future generations. The think tank\u2019s director Paul Johnson said Labour\u2019s proposals allowed it to maintain an overall deficit as high as \u00a330billion by 2020 \u2013 at a time when the Tories aim to be running a surplus of \u00a37billion to pay off Britain\u2019s debts. He told the BBC: \u2018It is clear Labour want to do quite a lot less in terms of the total (deficit). They don\u2019t want to get rid of the deficit altogether, they are happy to borrow to invest. They would be happy with a deficit of \u00a325-30billion, whereas the Conservatives don\u2019t want a deficit at all.\u2019 Miss Powell later said she did not recognise the \u00a330billion. But under pressure, she confirmed Labour would borrow to fund the Government\u2019s investment spending, which is forecast to be about that amount by 2020. \u2018We are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the Parliament,\u2019 she said. \u2018We may use some investment borrowing for much-needed investment but not for day-to-day spending. 'Those figures are other people\u2019s figures. It depends on what the books are like.\u2019 Tory Treasury minister Priti Patel said Miss Powell had \u2018let the cat out of the bag\u2019. She added: \u2018Labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they\u2019d borrow more if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. Add in the fact that they\u2019re refusing to admit which taxes they\u2019d raise and you\u2019ve got a recipe for total economic chaos.\u2019 Miss Powell also clashed with BBC presenter Andrew Neil as he questioned Labour\u2019s claims of an \u2018explosion\u2019 in the use of zero hours contracts. She snapped at him: \u2018In the real world, Andrew where I live, OK, unlike where you live\u2026\u2019 Mr Neil hit back: \u2018You\u2019ve no idea where I live, just answer the question.\u2019 Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party\u2019s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told last September\u2019s Labour conference that \u2018in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing\u2019. But the fine print of Labour\u2019s pledges show it has left itself flexibility to borrow the Government\u2019s entire capital budget for spending on things such as roads, schools and railways.Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander yesterday warned Labour may set out no more details of its tax and spending plans before the election. Critics point out its deficit reduction programme amounts to less than \u00a31billion of cuts and the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, which experts warn may raise nothing. Challenged over Labour\u2019s plans, Mr Alexander said: \u2018We have set out our programme.\u2019 Miss Powell said Labour was \u2018very clear we can widen the tax base\u2019 \u2013 suggesting the party plans to drag more people into paying tax. Labour later insisted this meant getting more people into better paid jobs so they would pay more tax and receive fewer benefits. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told last September\u2019s Labour conference that \u2018in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing\u2019 Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party\u2019s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms. He is also expected to make a fresh attack on planned Tory cuts. But former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn said he had to reach beyond Labour\u2019s usual supporters to have any hope of winning. Mr Milburn told LBC radio: \u2018Instead of going down to your core vote you have got to be reaching out to your non-core vote. Why? For a very pragmatic reason \u2013 if you are going to form a majority government you cannot really do it with 32.8 per cent of the vote.\u2019 Meanwhile, the Tories also came under fire over their plans for \u00a312 billion in welfare cuts after Iain Duncan Smith indicated the proposals may not be made public before the election. The Work and Pensions Secretary added: \u2018When we are right and we are ready, we will talk about what we plan to do ... \u2018(Voters) know for certain that we are going to save that \u00a312 billion. We may, we may not, decide that it\u2019s relevant to put something out there about some of those changes.\u2019 Labour activists were in mutiny last night over this \u2018shameful\u2019 \u00a35 mug boasting that the party would put controls on immigration. The red cup, for sale on the fundraising section of Labour\u2019s website, is one of five carrying its key election pledges. Activists dubbed it the \u2018Farage mug\u2019, referring to the Ukip leader, and called on Labour to withdraw it and drop all plans to control migration. But the controversy led to a surge in sales. By last night almost 250 of the mugs had been sold compared to just six of the ones promoting Labour\u2019s vow to create a \u2018strong economic foundation\u2019. Veteran left-winger Diane Abbott said: \u2018This shameful mug is an embarrassment. But the real problem is that immigration controls are one of our pledges at all.\u2019 It comes after Labour was branded patronising for using a pink bus to attract women voters. A party spokesman defended the mugs, saying: \u2018Labour has five election pledges. This is one.\u2019",

        "article": "More than 1,500 airline passengers may have been exposed to rubella, after an air stewardess unknowingly contracted the disease. The unnamed China Airlines flight attendant began developing symptoms for the disease - also known as German measles - on March 14. Four days later, doctors confirmed she had German measles and was placed in quarantine, the People's Daily Online reported. Incubation: The air stewardess on the China Airlines flight (not pictured) contracted the disease in February . But the woman, from northern Taiwan, may have infected a number of people during the incubation period - including passengers on the flights. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CDC) is now hoping to follow up with 1,558 people who travelled on China Airline's flights between February 21 and February 28, according to Asia One. It is thought 686 Taiwan nationals and 872 international passengers came into contact with the stewardess. But so far, it has only managed to contact 72 of the individuals - and has encouraged anyone who may have travelled on the flights to come forward. Six of the flights were international - four between Taiwan to Japan, and two between Taiwan and Singapore. The CDC is contacting the appropriate authorities in each country to track down the last of the international passengers. Search: But she may have come into contact with as many as 1,558 people before symptoms arrived . Rash: An example of the rash rubella causes . German measles is one of a number of similar viral infections that children commonly pick up at school. These infections, called enteroviruses or adenoviruses, cause fine pink rashes and mild fevers. Rubella - sometimes known as German measles - can cause serious damage to a developing baby if caught by a pregnant woman so it is important to keep an infected child away from pregnant women. The condition has an incubation period of two to three weeks, but actually only lasts for three to five days. An infected child will be infectious from a week before symptoms of the illness appear until four days after the patient appears to have recovered. China Airlines is the flagship carrier for China, and is based in Taiwan. It operates about 1,300 commercial flights every week to destinations around the world .",

Stade Francais fly-half Plisson comes in for the injured Camille Lopez, who sustained a badly bruised knee during Sunday's 29-0 triumph over Italy, while loosehead prop Eddy Ben Arous has also been ruled out for the match at Twickenham as Vincent makes a start. Plisson, who impressed as he came off the bench and scored 10 points against Italy, broke his nose at the Stadio Olimpico but has been passed fit to take on leaders England. Stade Francais fly-half Jules Plisson will start for France in the Six Nations game against England . France coach Philippe Saint-Andre's (right) side still have a minor chance of winning the Six Nations . Plisson has replaced Camille Lopez in the France team to face England on Saturday at Twickenham . Saint-Andre told www.lequipe.fr: 'At Twickenham, I need players that are a hundred percent fit, and Camille was doubtful on Wednesday. Jules has a broken nose but he is determined to play. He's okay for Saturday.' Veteran France prop Thomas Domingo had been tipped to replace Ben Arous as he joined up with the squad for training this week, but Saint-Andre believes he has sufficient cover on the replacements bench in Uini Atonio and Rabah Slimani. He added: 'With Uini Atonio and Rabah Slimani, we have two versatile players. 'It's hard for Thomas (Domingo) but it is difficult to assimilate into two training sessions (what is needed). We trust those who are with us from the start of the Six Nations.' Lopez (right) sustained a badly bruised knee in the 29-0 victory over Italy last weekend . Vincent Debaty starts ahead of Eddy Ben Arous, who has also been ruled out with injury . Saint-Andre believes that the versatility of players such as Uini Atonio is key to his team's strength . Les Bleus' victory last weekend - their second of the tournament - took them to within two points of England, who sit level with Ireland and Wales. There is still a slight chance France can lift the trophy if they can beat England on their home turf and the other two results go their way with Wales travelling to Italy and Scotland at home to the Irish.

The 29-year-old showed off his new wheels at Carrington as Manchester United prepare to take on Liverpool in a crucial clash in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Liverpool are only two points behind Louis van Gaal\u2019s side, who are occupying the fourth qualifying position, but Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side haven\u2019t lost in the Premier League since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. Wayne Rooney heads into Manchester United training in his sparkling new \u00a3104,590 BMW i8 sports car . Rooney relaxes at the wheel of his new motor as he prepares to take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday . Rooney has splashed out \u00a3104,590 on his new BMW i8 having scored five goals in his last six Manchester United appearances. The new hybrid from BMW uses the combination of an electric motor and a powerful petrol engine which provide extremely low emissions into the environment. Rooney will certainly be quick into training as the sports car can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 4.4 seconds, and has a top speed limited to 155mph. The United captain produced this knockout celebration after scoring against Tottenham at the weekend . Rooney's team-mate Daley Blind smiles for the cameras as he arrived at United training with his girlfriend . Blind (left) tries to dispossess Harry Kane during United's 3-0 win over Tottenham last weekend . Perhaps the United captain splashed out on a new motor as a celebration for his return to form. Van Gaal has utilised the England captain as a forward again recently and the results are proving worthwhile as Manchester United crushed Tottenham 3-0 at Old Trafford last weekend. United fans will hope Rooney is up to speed for the trip to Anfield as van Gaal\u2019s side looks to consolidate a position in the Premier League's prestigious top four ahead of their fierce rivals.

Ed Miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities,was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife Justine in a modest kitchen at his \u00a32million North London home. Now it has emerged that the image of the Labour leader as a man of the people with a run-of-the-mill home was not all it appeared. For Mr Miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children tonight revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room . Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' The poky room the couple were pictured in, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed last night by a family friend to be a 'functional kitchenette' for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Today Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail . 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in yesterday's paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen . Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day . Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.' Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.",

The cute plum number suited Pippa's tanned skin to a tee and she topped it all off with a studded clutch by Hoss Intropia, which brought out the color of both her ribbon waistband and pointed courts. Sadly, neither the dress or the bag are up for grabs, but if you click to the right, you'll head to Tabitha Webb's website where you can shop the current collection. The brand hasn't been around long. It launched its first bespoke collection in 2013 with its aim to make English elegance accessible.

The nightclub owner was escorted by his wife Elizabeth, who teamed her crisp white shirt with an acid lemon skirt. Pippa talked and posed for pictures with Andrew Neil, the Chairman of the media group that owns The Spectator. The brunette matched her accessories accordingly with her belt and clutch bag all in a similar nude shade . Royal BFF: Guy Pelly (pictured right) is close friends with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, and attended the party with wife, Elizabeth Pelly . This is only Pippa's second outing since returning from the US where she was in talks with the NBC network about a presenting role. A keen sportswoman, who's currently in training for the 50-mile London to Brighton Bike Ride, she recently stunned in an ice-blue floor length gown at the Disability SnowSport UK Ball. She met Heather Mills McCartney at the event and gave a speech in which she called for there to be more winter sports opportunities for disabled athletes. Windswept in plum!

The Barclays Premier League champions, who must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since the start of the 2011-12 season. Despite spending an extravagant amount of money, Martin Demichelis and Fernando are the only two players who have managed to hold down a regular starting spot since sealing moves to the Etihad Stadium. Man City have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since 2011 despite spending \u00a3327m - Aleksandar Kolarov will replace Gael Clichy from the side defeated by Barcelona on February 24, 2015 . Fernando has replaced Gareth Barry while Martin\u00a0Demichelis has come in for Joleon Lescott - above picture was taken before Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Napoli on September 14, 2011 . The aforementioned duo have replaced Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry respectively in what is perceived to be Manchester City's strongest line-up. Gael Clichy has come close to edging his way into Manchester City's side but he shares left back duties with Aleksandar Kolarov and is suspended on Wednesday after being sent off in the first leg. Their major European rivals, on the other hand, have made at least six changes to their starting line-ups. Arsenal have made the most with 10 while upcoming opponents Barcelona have made six. Manchester City may have to change tack in Europe if they crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday, as a side of their calibre should be progressing to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious competition. 2011: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko . 2015: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Fernando, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko (two changes) Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) have joined Lionel Messi (right) at the Nou Camp . 2011: Valdes; Alves, Puyol, Pique, Abidal; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Villa, Messi, Pedro . 2015: Ter Stegen; Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Six changes) European champions Real Madrid have made six major changes in the same period - with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale sealing moves to the Santiago Bernabeu during the last four years.

Reports in France on Wednesday claimed United officials had been in touch with their counterparts in the principality to inform them that there would be no move for the misfiring Colombian at the end of the season. But a source at Old Trafford told Sportsmail that no decision has yet been made on Falcao and added that none would be forthcoming until May. Manchester United will delay making a decision over Radamel Falcao's future until the end of the season . Falcao has just over three months to convince Louis van Gaal that he is worthy of a \u00a343m transfer fee . The 29-year-old, once one of the most feared strikers in the game, has struggled for form at United since he made the switch from Monaco in the summer. He suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury last January that saw him miss the World Cup and some have questioned whether he can return to the same level. Falcao penned a season-long deal with United but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent. However, an injury to Robin van Persie means Falcao is likely to get more chances to show manager Louis van Gaal why he should keep him at the end of the season. The Colombia international has scored four Premier League goals since joining from Monaco . Falcao is expected to benefit from an injury to Manchester United team-mate Robin van Persie .",

An Osceola County, Florida mother has been arrested after authorities said they found her two young daughters going door to door trying to sell their toys. The Osceola County Sheriff\u2019s Office says the girls, ages 7 and 9, were walking barefoot about a half-mile from their home about 10:30 a.m. Thursday. The girls told deputies they were selling their toys 'to help mommy stay in the house.' The girls had missed a 7:20 a.m. bus to school, deputies said. The deputies found the mother, April Emery, at home sleeping. According to investigators, when deputies woke her up she said she blamed her daughters for not waking her up at school time. WTSP reports that Emery did not seem to be concerned about her daughters' well being. When deputies told her they found her daughters walking around, she told them, 'Well they should know better, it's their job to wake me up in the morning to get ready for school.' Emery was charged with child neglect without great bodily harm. The arrest was reported to the state Department of Children and Families, which had investigated previous allegations of poor child care at the home. According to the sheriff\u2019s office, the home had running water, electricity and food, and the girls were were wearing clean clothes and had toys 'to keep them entertained.' The girls are now staying with a family member. Accused of neglect: April Emery allegedly told police it was her child's fault for neglect because they were the ones responsible for waking her up for school .",

        "article": "Mark Cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report into past practices of doping and suggested Lance Armstrong's charity return to the Tour de France 'could be done in a different environment'. CIRC was established to investigate whether the UCI, cycling's world governing body, was complicit in past doping practices, such as the Armstrong affair, which saw the American stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned for life. Some of the reports findings were scathing but, according to 2011 world champion and 25-time Tour stage winner Cavendish, little was revelatory. Mark Cavendish says there were few revelations in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report . The 25-time Tour de France stage winner said the report was 'all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document' Cavendish, speaking after announcing he'll compete in August's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, said: 'To be brutally honest, I don't really think there's anything new in there. 'There's all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document. 'People talk about the past of cycling like it's the present. It's a little bit frustrating; that would be an understatement. 'As long as cycling's cleaning up and I'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport I love, then I'll continue to be happy with that.' One unnamed but 'respected' professional cyclist told CIRC that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope, while another reported the figure was 20 per cent. Cavendish doesn't see much use in the report, commissioned by new UCI president Brian Cookson . Cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month. He did not speak to CIRC and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views. Asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton, Cavendish said: 'Absolutely not. I really don't. I wasn't asked at all to say anything. 'Ninety-five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent won't have raced or known that rider, so couldn't comment on it. 'I think certain quotes from unreliable sources don't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process.' Armstrong plans to return to the Tour alongside former footballer Geoff Thomas, another cancer survivor. Lance Armstrong (left) plans to return to the Tour de France, the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping, as part of a charity ride with former footballer Geoff Thomas . Thomas is riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton, which includes Cavendish, to raise funds for charity and has invited Armstrong to join him. Cavendish said: 'There's no denying what Lance did for charity; he did work a lot for charity. 'But maybe this situation could be done in a different environment.'",

        "article": "Whether it be in the boardroom or on the hunting ground, male competition can cause a sudden spike in testosterone levels. Now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the 'hunt'. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Pictured is a family who was involved in the study.\u00a0Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle . The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer . The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small, tight-knit communities that produce their own food. 'Our goal was to look at the interaction between different hormones in motivating behaviour in a naturalistic context,' said Adrian Jaeggi, co-lead author at University of California, Santa Barbara. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home.\u00a0The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer, and linked with changes in testosterone (pictured) 'Hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years.' Previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect. Jaeggi said he expected to see a trade-off between the two hormones and was surprised to find the positive relationship between them. When a man tells his wife or girlfriend she looks nice, it\u2019s not because of her new haircut. Instead, it\u2019s his hormones doing the talking. A study found that a whiff of the \u2018love chemical\u2019 oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive. And German researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy, a trait that is rare among mammals, other than ourselves. The University of Bonn scientists showed 40 young men who claimed to be passionately in love pictures of their partners. They were asked how attractive they found the women after being given a placebo spray to sniff and a burst of oxytocin. Pictures of strangers and of long-term acquaintances, such as work colleagues were also shown. The men, who were in long-term relationships, also underwent scans to check how much the brain areas responsible for rewarding feelings lit up. Lead author Dirk Scheele said: \u2018When the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo, the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women. \u2018We did not detect this effect with pictures of long-standing acquaintances.\u2019 According to Jaeggi and co-lead author Ben Trumble, high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a 'winner effect' experienced by men making a kill. It could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the Tsimane. In either case, the increased oxytocin could serve as a balance to make the hunters kinder, more generous and more willing to share their bounty. 'Almost half a century ago, it was famously documented that successful Kung hunters were jokingly insulted by others in order to 'cool their hearts' to 'make (them) gentle,' lest pride or boasting disrupt the egalitarian social system common to many foragers,' said senior co-author Michael Gurven. 'Here we observe a potential hormonal analogue consistent with the type of levelling behaviour seen in hunter-gatherer societies.' Another use for both hormones may have to do with post-hunt recovery. Both are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity. 'These men are coming home, they're finished with work for the day, and they're about to eat and share food,' Jaeggi continued. 'So the need to be social coincides with the need to regenerate and it would make sense for the same hormones to facilitate both functions.' To conduct the study, Trumble joined the hunters as they went out into the jungle and attempted to make a kill to feed their families. He then took saliva specimens along the way, collecting them at exact intervals. The oxytocin was measured in the UCSB Human Biodemography Laboratory. Though the sample size is 'not huge,' he and Jaeggi noted, the study 'definitely adds to the current literature in which the interplay between testosterone and oxytocin is often overlooked.' 'I think the 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' effect could potentially be very widespread,' said Jaeggi. 'Reconnecting with their families after a day of separation would have been a very common challenge for men throughout evolutionary history, and oxytocin could help with that.' Another interesting correlation, Trumble noted, is that the average Tsimane hunt lasts eight and a half hours, roughly equivalent to a workday here. As well as helping partners reconnect after a day apart, oxytocin may have use in post-hunt recovery. Both the love hormone and testosterone are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity .",

        "article": "Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson has refused to comment on a federal report published Wednesday which found\u00a0racial bias in his department - with officers routinely discriminating against African-Americans by using excessive force. The chief was asked about his future and that of his employees by CNN\u00a0but would only say: 'I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it'. He avoided questions over whether he would step down but added he would 'take action where necessary'. Scroll down for video . When questioned by a reporter about the damning Justice Department report which found racial profiling present in the Ferguson police department, Chief Tom Jackson was unable to give an answer . Police Chief Thomas Jackson fields questions related to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on August 13, 2014 in Ferguson. The police chief and his department have been widely criticized for their bungled response to teen's death which sparked national protests . The Justice Department report  found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis County suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide. Most of Ferguson's police officers and top elected officials are white, but two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black. The report uncovered racist emails from three city employees, including some that belittled black residents or President Obama. All three employees responsible for those emails left their jobs on Thursday - it's not clear whether they were fired or resigned. However the Justice Department refused to prosecute white cop Darren Wilson who fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson on August 9, 2014. Catalyst: The Justice Department began a civil rights investigation following the August shooting of Michael Brown (left), an unarmed black 18-year-old, by white police officer Darren Wilson (right) The shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown led to protests in Ferguson, Missouri (pictured) and across the country over racial bias in the police . A St. Louis County grand jury also found no evidence of a crime and announced in November that Wilson would face no state charges. President Obama  made his first remarks on the DOJ report on Friday saying the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement. 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Ferguson city leaders will meet with Justice Department officials in about two weeks and provide a plan for ways to improve the police department following the scathing report, Mayor James Knowles III said on Friday. Knowles said that the goal is to work out an agreement with the federal government. A specific meeting date has not been set. 'They want to hear what we will do,' Knowles said. 'We're going to hopefully work out some sort of agreement and we'll move forward. 'We've got to come up with solutions now,' Knowles said. Knowles said city leaders were still going over the report 'line by line' before determining reforms. Asked about Police Chief Tom Jackson, Knowles said he still leads the police force, but the mayor declined to discuss Jackson's future. Further messages seeking comment from Jackson were not returned. 'I'm not here to just chop heads,' Knowles said. 'We have to evaluate everything in the report, pick out what are the systemic issues and what are the things we can fix.' The mayor said he first learned of the emails on Wednesday after meeting with Justice officials in St. Louis. He said he was so incensed that he ordered the accounts of all three employees disabled while he was in the car returning to Ferguson after the meeting. Knowles said there was no evidence that Jackson or other police administrators were aware of those emails.",

Users will stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a three-factor security system - the bracelet, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a device registered with the app. Nymi vibrates and built-in LEDs light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them. Users stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a three-factor security system - the bracelet, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. When the Nymi authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their ECG wave, not their heart rate. It can therefore adjust to typical variations in heart rate, even if the wearer has an irregular ECG as a result of a medical condition. The product's site said: 'Nymi offers security without compromising convenience, putting you, and only you, in control of your identity. 'As you head out the door, you\u2019ll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures. 'With accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities. 'The Nymi can replace everything from the PIN on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security, privacy or convenience.' In the first-of-its-kind trials by a UK bank, Halifax asked customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts. When connected to an account, the band could also be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too. Marc Lien, Halifax's director of innovation and digital development, said: 'Exploring innovative technology is a real focus for us at the bank. In the first-of-its-kind trials by a UK bank, Halifax asked staff and customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts. When connected to an account, the band could, in theory, be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too (example shown) An ECG differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart. Nymi only works with a registered person's cardiac rhythm, meaning if the bracelet is stolen it can't be hacked. The technology (pictured) was developed by Toronto-based Bionym . The bank said the band (illustrated) only works when worn by the account owner and it must be paired with the device being used . 'We are in the very early stages of exploring potential uses for the Nymi Band and wearable technology more widely.' The bank - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - said the technology  only works when worn by the account owner and the band has to be paired with the device being used to access the account. Lloyds recently updated its online banking app with a similar feature that pairs and recognises the phone or tablet it is being used on. This removes the need to enter the username, password and memorable information every time. Instead the app just asks for the latter. The Nymi bracelet can be pre-ordered for $79 (\u00a350). Devices were due to ship in December but the site has not updated when it will go on general sale.",

The British No 1 went down 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 to the experienced Spaniard in the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. Watson looked in command in the first set when the world No 13 turned an ankle and called on the trainer for extensive treatment. Heather Watson was knocked out at Indian Wells after losing to experienced Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro . Suarez Navarro was troubled with an ankle injury throughout and it appeared to affect the British No 1 . Yet, as is so often the case in tennis, the unaffected player seemed to be put off by what was going on with her opponent. From 5-3 up she lost the next three games and then went down in the tiebreak as the Spaniard recovered quickly from whatever discomfort she was suffering. After getting level the decider turned when Watson lost the fourth game from 40-0 up and she became disheartened after that as the heat took its toll. However the points garnered from this week and an attacking form of tennis will embed Watson in the top 50 and put her close to the 40 mark. Andy Murray takes on unseeded Frenchman Adrian Mannarino on Wednesday in his bid to make the last eight of the men's event.

        "article": "The ISIS militant who appears in\u00a0a video purporting to show a boy executing an captive Israeli-Arab is a French terrorist whose relatives include a notorious Islamist who slaughtered Jewish children and a woman who took her baby to join the violent extremists. Sabri Essid has been identified as a well-known jihadist, and the half-brother of Mohammed Merah, who shot dead three children, a rabbi and three paratroopers during a terror rampage in the French city of Toulouse. But the two, who are understood to have been close before Merah's 30-hour stand-off with French special forces ended in his death, are among a number of extremists radicalised within the same family. Merah's sister Souad is known to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join Islamic State with her four children - including her nine-month-old baby. Family: The man on the right of ISIS's latest horrific video has been identified as Sabri Essid, a French terrorist who is a member of a family with a number of radicalised extremists . Essid, a married father, was named by security experts earlier today, after he appeared alongside the young boy in a video claiming to show the execution of a so-called Arab Israeli spy. The man  believed to be Essid stands by the boy speaks in French as he refers to the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris in January in which four Jews were killed. 'Oh Jews, indeed Allah has gifted us with killing your followers in your own stronghold in France,' says the man. However, doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the video, which is heavily edited. Experts have questioned whether the boy, thought to be about ten, was really the person who pulled the trigger, supposedly murdering\u00a019-year-old Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam with a single gunshot. There is less mystery surrounding Essid himself, who has long been known to counter-terrorism forces. 'The similarities between Essid and the man in the video are very clear,' said an investigating source in Paris. 'Plenty of experts have made the link.' Terrorist: Mohammed Merah, Essid's half-brother, killed seven people - including three children - in 2013 . Shooting: The 23-year-old targeted the\u00a0Ozar Hatorah Jewish school in Toulouse, also killing a rabbi . A French police source has also told AFP, France's national news agency, that 'we are checking' the identity of the man in the video. Essid, 30, from Toulouse, was caught in Syria in December 2006 in a house known to shelter Al-Qaeda members on their way to Iraq. He was sent back to France and was sentenced in 2009 to five years in jail, including one year suspended, in a case involving an Iraqi jihadist network. On his release in 2010, he returned to Toulouse - where he became a constant companion of half-brother  Merah. His father had lived with Merah's mother, and Essid was close to the killer and his brother Abdelkader. Merah, 23, would go on to\u00a0wreak terror in the town, shooting three soldiers, a rabbi and three school children outside a Jewish school, before being shot dead. Radicalised: Mohammed's sister Souad Merah, pictured, took her four children to join ISIS last year . Horror: The family of\u00a0Muhammad Musalam, 19, purportedly shot in the ISIS video by the unnamed child, have said the Arab-Israeli was not a spy. Pictured: Parents\u00a0Said and Hind Musalam mourn in the family home . Essid left France for Syria in 2014, as did Souad Merah, the sister of the Toulouse gunman, who took her children on the bus south from Toulouse to Barcelona, where they boarded Turkish Airlines flights to first Istanbul and then Gaziantep. Her husband Abdelouahed El Baghdadi, was arrested by French authorities, in September last year when he arrived back at Toulouse airport with the two older children. Their mother Souad Merah is believed to be in Algeria with the two youngest children. But it is not clear if Essid's wife and children travelled with him to Syria.",

In spite of his 5ft 6in frame Pacquiao is passionate about basketball and is even an occasional player-coach for the KIA Sorento team in the Philippine Basketball Association's league. So a reporter probably should have known better than to bet Pacquiao he couldn't nail a three-pointer on a crowded court in his United States base. Manny Pacquiao shoots hoops in Los Angeles as he prepares to take on Floyd Mayweather on May 2 . Reporter\u00a0Elie Seckbach (green and white tracksuit) lost a 100 push-up bet that Pac-Man wouldn't nail a three . The video journalist, Elie Seckbach, said he'd do 100 push-ups if the 36-year-old sunk a maximum from the corner of the court and was good to his word. Pacquiao's shooting form up to that point was sketchy at best, with air balls as common as the sound of swish from the net, although he does sink a backwards shot from the free throw line. On winning the bet, the pound-for-pound legend even stands over the reporter at one point to ensure his push-ups are up to the superfit boxer's standards. Pacquiao shows his skills on the court as he works up a sweat during the countdown to the Las Vegas fight . Pacquiao makes a fool of this opponent as he dribbles through his legs in the video . Colourful reporter Seckbach has form in losing bets with Pacquiao having done the same back in 2010 when Pacquiao delivered a three-pointer in an organised local game. 'Manny Pacquiao - Do not bet him, you will not win,' he said after Pacquiao gave him a fist pump of approval after his push-ups were complete. Pacquiao is attracting a crowd wherever he goes in LA, his base ahead of the richest fight of all time, whether it's shadow boxing in a park or shooting hoops.",

Juve scraped past Sassuolo on Monday as the playmaker scored his seventh league goal of the campaign and gave them a clear lead over nearest rivals Roma with 12 games left to play. The papers in Italy were keen to praise Pogba after his match-winning performance with Corriere dello Sport\u00a0saying: 'A moment of magic from the Frenchman defeats Sassuolo to unlock a difficult match and gift the victory.' Corriere dello Sport praised Paul Pogba after his late goal sent Juventus 11 points clear at the top of Serie A .

        "article": "(CNN)Organized labor is up in arms about President Barack Obama's effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific that involves 11 nations. The agreement, union leaders argue, threatens to take even more jobs away from Americans. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka sent a clear message to members of Congress, warning, \"There is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact, and then we will not forget this vote for a long time.\" The AFL-CIO announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up. The tension between organized labor and Obama is not new. The struggles have been going on since 2009 when the President allowed the Employee Free Choice Act to wither in Congress. The act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions. The President avoided making any strong appeals for the bill, though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid. \"There is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials,\" one labor leader said, \"broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda.\" Even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions. Organized labor has not been that surprised. The truth is that unions have been on the defense against Democratic presidents for decades. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. \"It will cost jobs,\" warned Michigan Democrat David Bonior said of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton endorsed. \"It will drive down our standard of living. If we don't stand up for the working people in this country, who is going to?\" In the past few decades, many Democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party, as they had been during the creation of the New Deal and Great Society. As organized labor became a smaller part of the American workforce, Democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote. A larger number of Democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence. These voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues, such as environmental regulation, than they are with middle class jobs. Many Democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets. New voices that came into the Democratic Party after the 1960s wanted to challenge Republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy. The opportunities for Democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives. The Koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren't in unions. Unions are under assault, and the movement is looking for help. Democrats, and some Republicans, often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality. Much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. Without strong unions, the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started. As George Gresham, the president of United Health Care Workers East wrote in The New York Times, \"By defunding unions and weakening union members via 'right to work' laws, corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers' primary means of raising wages, securing pensions and improving workers conditions. Workers' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized.\" Democrats need to listen to what the AFL-CIO is saying. They need to push back against President Obama, even if this creates political opportunities for Republicans, so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda. As Democrats continually watch Republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit, they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the White House and Congress in the coming years.",

        "article": "(CNN)Serena Williams has won 19 grand slam singles tennis titles, including six U.S. Opens and five Wimbledons. She has four Olympic gold medals. For years, she's had a reputation as one of her sport's top players. Yet for all her myriad accomplishments, Williams says one of her \"biggest ... and proudest moments\" came Friday night -- in the second round of a tournament in Indian Wells, California. It's not who she was playing, but where. The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is where Williams was booed during the 2001 finale. Her older sister, Venus, got similar treatment in the stands, and her father Richard told USA Today he was subjected to racial abuse. Afterward, Serena Williams vowed she'd never go back. She kept true to that promise for 14 years, a time when she often dominated her sport. On Friday, Williams was back. And instead of jeers, there were cheers. And tears, shed by Williams during the crowd's loud, boisterous, more than minute-long ovation. \"I knew that I really wanted to do it,\" Williams said afterward of her return to Indian Wells. \"But up until that moment, I didn't really know if it was the right thing for me to do. \"And I feel like that's when I felt it was the right thing,\" she said of her welcome. \"... Receiving the love from the crowd here, it really meant a lot to me.\" The BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, just east of Palm Desert, California, isn't a grand slam but is one of the top tournaments in tennis. As such, top players go there to battle the best and prove their mettle. That's what brought Serena Williams to Indian Wells in 2001. The then-19-year-old got to the finals after her scheduled semifinal foe -- sister Venus -- pulled out minutes before the matching, citing a knee injury. Amid whispers he'd predetermined the outcome, Richard Williams told USA Today that he \"had trouble holding back tears\" given the treatment he got in the stands. According to him, one man said, \"I wish it was '75, we'd skin you alive.\" (Charlie Pasarell, the tournament director at the time, denied any racial abuse in the same story; CNN didn't hear back from him after requesting an interview.) Serena Williams scored a three-set win over Kim Clijsters. But she didn't celebrate. She spent hours crying in the locker room. \"(I drove) back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality,\" Serena Williams wrote in TIME magazine in February. \"Emotionally it seemed easier to stay away.\" Serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at Indian Wells . The roller-coaster ride back to Indian Wells started when Williams accepted a wild-card invitation to play in this year's tournament, a difficult decision she recounted in TIME. Her father and sister, Venus, still stayed away. While she's been on her sport's biggest stage for well over a decade, the world's No. 1-ranked played admitted being nervous in the weeks, days and hours leading to her opening match. Those feelings broke out in the open as she walked onto the court, a response she called \"overwhelming\" and said she \"wasn't really prepared for.\" The match itself wasn't easy, either. Romanian-born Monica Niculescu, the world's 68th-ranked player, challenged her for more than two hours. Still, Williams managed to overcome her competitor and her emotions to win in straight sets, 7-5, 7-5. Declining to reflect on the past, Williams simply said afterward, \"Today was a wonderful day for me, for women's tennis, ... for tennis in general, and for everyone.\" The 33-year-old still has a lot of matches ahead of her. That includes more at Indian Wells, whose talented field includes Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki. Still, for all her competitive fire, Williams isn't feeling much pressure to win. She feels like she has already won. \"I don't feel like I actually have to hold the trophy at the end of this,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm already holding the trophy. And I've never felt this way. 'I feel like just being here is a huge win, not only for me but for so many people. And it's a wonderful feeling.\" CNN's Ravi Ubha contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don\u2019t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath\u00a0Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece \u2013 such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet \u2013 have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop\u2019s advice. 'Although not as \"sexy\" as \"anti-inflammatory diets\" and \"magical cures\", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website\u2019s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic\u2019s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a \u2018magical cure\u2019 for morning sickness \u2013 while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation \u2013 Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you\u2019re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Things got testy on \"CNN Tonight\" when conservative commentator Ben Ferguson charged that rappers like Trinidad James are profiting off the n-word. \"I'll be honest with you,\" Ferguson told James on Monday night. \"I think you know that we should probably get rid of the n-word, but in reality, I think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they don't stop using the word.\" The two were part of a panel discussion about who can say the n-word. The panel also included CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill. \"I'm making money off of doing music and being creative, sir,\" James responded. \"I'm not making money just because I use the n-word. Nobody goes to buy an album because it's full of the n-word.\" To which Ferguson responded: \"Trinidad, you wouldn't be on this show tonight if it wasn't for using the n-word in your rap music. Let's be honest.\" Trinidad James is the rapper whose hit song, \"All Gold Everything,\" is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- was caught on a Vine video repeating the n-word seven times on camera. The woman, Beauton Gilbow, was bombarded with claims that she's just as racist as the fraternity members who were caught singing a racist song on a bus earlier this month. In a previous interview with CNN, James said he was willing to give the house mom a pass -- though he said he didn't condone her use of the word. But when Ferguson said Monday the rapper was only on the show for his use of the word, the third panelist -- Hill -- quickly jumped in. \"He wouldn't be on the show if a white woman hadn't said the n-word on a tape,\" he said. \"White people have been saying the [n-word] long before Trinidad was born.\" Watch the full exchange above.",

        "article": "Jane Lu\u2019s success started like many others. She got up early each morning, put on a suit, waved goodbye to her supportive parents and took off to start work. The only difference was that the 28-year-old didn\u2019t have an office to go to, a formal job title or a boss to report to. Keeping her ventures a secret in fear that her parents wouldn't approve Ms Lu would venture into the city each day to hold up in a cafe or library to contact wholesalers, find new and exciting styles and build her online shopping empire. Business is booming: Ms Lu's online shopping business has turned over $10 million in the last calendar year . Ms Lu\u2019s story is one of perseverance; determination and achievement with her successful online shopping venture ShowPony.com reportedly turning over $10 million in the past calendar year. She distributes clothing to 45 countires, has 420,000 followers on Instagram and 464,000 friends on Facebook, attributing her success to dominating the social media platforms. After reading about her triumphs it will surprise you to know that her road to success was paved with a few failures. Ms Lu completed a business degree and gained an elusive graduate position before throwing it all away for her dream . With Ms Lu being the first one to admit things don\u2019t always work out the first time you give it a crack. She started her professional life in corporate finance first securing an elusive graduate position with KPMG and then moving on to accounting firm Ernst & Young . After spending some time pondering her future life as a corporate go getter, she said she was left feeling unfulfilled. \u2018I wasn\u2019t getting much out of my day to day and a uni friend said they wanted to start a business so quit my job and blindly followed.\u2019 Ms Lu took advantage of social media saying it was the perfect marketing opportunity for someone without much capital . \u2018The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn\u2019t know how to capitalise on it' Ms Lu\u2019s family, in a show of their unwavering support, lent her money for the start up venture was unsuccessful. \u2018It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I\u2019d quit my job so I couldn\u2019t really go crawling back to my old employers. It was also right in the middle of the global financial crisis so I really had no other option but continue on,\u2019 she told Daily Mail Australia. Being faced with the option of flight or fight Ms Lu secretly soldiered on in the hopes that she would have better news to give her parents soon. From humble beginnings: Ms Tu worked on bended knee scrubbing out her first warehouse,right, and she put in the hard yards before getting her first office, left. \u2018My parents lent me money to start up my first business and after it failed it felt really hard to justify to them why I didn\u2019t want to go back to business, which was their dream job for me. Selling clothes online was completely foreign to them. They don\u2019t even use email,\u2019 she said. In a few short years Ms Lu has managed to take her business from a dream to cold hard reality. She said if she had given up when she first failed she would have never achieved what she has today. Ms Lu now has 10 employees and says she loves that she has the opportunity to have fun each and every day . Try and try again: \u2018So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it\u2019s really not as bad or as scary as it seems' \u2018So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it\u2019s really not as bad or as scary as it seems. \u2018It is worth the risk and you should always back yourself,\u2019 she added. Ms Lu said although she could have spent a lot more time on the couch after her first disappointment but she found it really motivating to get up every day with purpose, as if she had a boss to report to, and work for the job she really wanted. \u2018It can be so easy to sit at home and watch TV or go to the beach with other friends who aren\u2019t working but you can\u2019t let yourself do that. Its about being productive every day.\u2019 After being brought up in a \u2018very academically focused\u2019 environment Ms Lu said she wasn\u2019t once taught about how to be successful if you pursue a creative career maintain that passion can get you through. Ms Lu said she saw a gap in the online shopping market for affordable garments . Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Lu said she still finds it \u2018bizarre\u2019 to think of herself as a role model . \u2018Life is long and people have to stop thinking that you can\u2019t spend some of that time time when you are young to investing in yourself and what makes you happy.\u2019 \u2018Your work life pretty much takes up the majority of your life so why not work to live instead of live to work,\u2019 she added. After taking the online shopping market by storm Ms Lu said it was social media that catapulted her to success. \u2018Basically, I had no money when I started the business so I needed social media to get the brand out to our community.\u2019 Coming into a market where big businesses hadn\u2019t quite grasped the power of social media Ms Lu said there was a huge marketing sector that could be taken advantage of. \u2018It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I\u2019d quit my job so I couldn\u2019t really go crawling back to my old employers' \u2018The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn\u2019t know how to capitalise on it. She said while she was starting out social media remained relatively unknown with big businesses blowing it off as \u2018a fad\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s about building a loyal community who are genuinely interested instead of paying for advertising to just make sales.\u2019 Ms Lu used Facebook to start her social media campaign but says a lot of consumers are migrating to Insagram . Ms Lu said even though her she may not have been completely honest with her parents in the start of her career, she knows they are beyond proud of her accomplishments. \u2018At first they said \u2018I don\u2019t understand how you had the guts to do this\u2019 but in reality it was them who left everything to take their young family to Australia,\u2019 she said. Ms Tu was born in China, left, and was eight-years-old when she first moved to Australia, right. Ms Lu\u2019s family immigrated from China during political unrest in 1994 when she was eight years old. 'They quit their great jobs to work as cleaners and in factories, now that is gutsy,\u2019 she added. She said she knows it was their inital investment and support that helped her put herself out there and maintains that she doesnt know anyone thats worked as hard as them. Ms Tu said she came from a 'very academic' environment with her parents dreaming she would find a job where she could be financially stable . Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Lu said she still finds it \u2018bizarre\u2019 to think of herself as a role model for women who are out there working hard to achieve their dream. \u2018It is so bizarre, I mean, I don\u2019t really have any experience, my first business failed so really if I can do it, anyone can do it.\u2019 Her positive attitude caught the attention of The League of Extraordinary Women and they asked Ms Lu to take her story to the 'Run the World' conference where several of Australia\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs will tell of their trials and tribulations in the hopes of motivating a new generation of young female go-getters. Winners are grinners: Ms Lu said she has an amazing team who have become a huge part of her sucess . Chiquita Searle, general manager of the League, told Daily Mail Australia that they knew they wanted Ms Lu to speak after hearing of her overwhelming perseverance in the face of crushing adversity. \u2018It\u2019s so important for young entrepreneurs to see someone in Jane\u2019s position who didn\u2019t have the perfect run. \u2018It really wasn\u2019t an easy journey for her, she quit her job, her first business failed leaving her with $50,000 of debt and she spent years working before she gained any traction,\u2019 Ms Searle said. Ms Lu said throughout all her academic pursuits she was never once told she could be successful by chasing a creative dream .",

A children's hospice nurse has been struck off after posting a four-letter rant about work on Facebook . Allison Hopton, 40, posted a string of abusive remarks on the social networking site about the hospice - which provides end of life care for terminally ill children - in the mistaken belief that only her 380 friends could see them. Mrs Hopton had complained online about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'. In another message she joked that she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan. But a hearing was told her remarks could easily be seen by any patient, their families or a colleague with Facebook accounts if they simply searched for her name. Mrs Hopton was sacked from her job at the Ty Hafan hospice in Sully near Cardiff after the posts were discovered. She told her employers: 'Facebook is where people vent. Nurses are human. I don't mix work with my private life. 'I feel I have been professional.' She admitted to the Nursing and Midwifery Council that the comments had been inappropriate. The disciplinary panel, in Cardiff, ruled that she should be banned from working as a nurse. In a statement Mrs Hopton said: 'I cannot go back in time, although I wish I could. 'I have however reflected on the whole incident and changed my behaviour because of it. I accept that comments were irresponsible and stupid, a complete lapse of judgment.' Mrs Hopton, from near Swansea, South Wales, worked at the hospice from 2007 to 2011 when she was dismissed. She was originally given a six-month ban but the panel reviewed their decision and chose to strike her off as well. They ruled that Mrs Hopton, who did not attend the hearing, had not used her taken the opportunity to 'reflect' on her misconduct. A panel spokesman said: 'Mrs Hopton used a number of profanities on her Facebook page and made direct and indirect references to the hospice. Mrs Hopton moaned about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'. In another abusive message she said she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan . 'The panel was mindful of the vulnerable nature of those in her care and the sensitivity that would need to be applied to the families of patients at the hospice and the wider public. 'Her comments on Facebook had been wholly inappropriate and had undoubtedly called into question her judgment and integrity. 'The public rightly expect nurses to act in such a way as to uphold public confidence in the profession. 'As a registered nurse, Mrs Hopton had a duty to uphold public confidence in the profession. Her numerous remarks had undoubtedly brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute and undermined public confidence in the profession.' Mrs Hopton was sacked from her job at the Ty Hafan hospice in Sully near Cardiff after the posts were discovered .",

        "article": "An extremely rare \u00a31 coin dating back to the start of English Civil War is expected to fetch \u00a350,000 at auction. The solid silver 1643 Declaration Pound was struck in Oxford, which was Charles I's seat of power after he withdrew from London. Charles was beheaded just six years after the coin was created, but an inscription on the back declares the King's belief that he could not be toppled. An extremely rare \u00a31 coin from the start of English Civil War is expected to fetch \u00a350,000 at auction . The coin was made as the a new mint was set up in the city and was created to launch an official currency for parts of the country under the King's command. The legend on the back of the coin translates as 'Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered', symbolising the King's belief in the 'absolute monarch'. The words were a declaration of the King's power, but this belief in an almighty monarchy caused some of the tensions which led to the Civil War between the Royalist Cavaliers and the Parliamentarian Roundheads. The  large coin, which is more two inches across and remains in good condition, was passed down through one family for generations but the current owner did not realise its value. Timothy Medhurst, a coin specialist and auctioneer at Duke's Auctioneers in Dorchester, Dorset, where the coin will be sold, said it was the type of item he dreams of finding. 'This coin marked Charles I's attempts to regain his failing power and it represents a pivotal moment in the history of the British Isles,' he said. Charles I was beheaded just six years after the coin was created, but an inscription on the back declares the King's belief that he could not be toppled . 'It is a coin which is rare to find and it will cause a stir in the coin collecting world. 'The value of coins from this period are at an all-time high, and it will be highly sought after. 'The coin has been handed down through several generations to the current owner, who had no idea of its value and is as excited about the auction as I am. 'It is fair to say that 1643 was a crucial year in the history of the Civil War and it is fascinating to think that this coin was produced by hand, in silver, at such a tumultuous time. 'It was only six years after this coin was struck that Charles I was beheaded and labelled as \"tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy\" by the 59 judges who found him guilty of high treason.' The English Civil War (1642-1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between the Roundheads and Cavaliers in the Kingdom of England. It led to Charles I being beheaded and his son being exiled in 1649 as the monarchy was replaced by a protectorate, led by Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell's death, his son Richard was unable to maintain the confidence of the New Model Army, causing the protectorate to fall and the monarchy to be restored with Charles II on the throne in 1660. The sale takes place on March 12.",

        "article": "Hong Kong (CNN)A Canadian pastor, who went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip in late January, is being held in the reclusive Communist state, his family said early Thursday. The family of Rev. Hyeon Soo Lim said they received notice from Canadian officials that Pyongyang has confirmed that the pastor is being held. \"The Lim family and the church community is asking fellow Canadians and the international community to continue praying for his release and safe return home,\" a family spokeswoman said in a short emailed statement. Lim, 60, went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for his church, based in Mississauga, Ontario. On January 30, Lim traveled to North Korea from China with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day. Lim was scheduled to return February 4 from what was described as a \"routine\" trip to Rajin, in northeastern North Korea, where his church supports a nursery, orphanage and nursing home, according to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. In 1986, Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea with his wife and son. He speaks fluent Korean and leads a 3,000-member church. Pak, the church's spokeswoman, said she doesn't believe Lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing, which is prohibited in North Korea. \"He knows the language, he knows the nature of the government, so we don't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained,\" she said. \"We don't believe that's the way he would have behaved. He's very wise about that.\" Previously, North Korea has detained Westerners on religious grounds. Cases include American Kenneth Bae, who was detained for two years after North Korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae was released in November. Another American, Jeffrey Fowle, was arrested after leaving a Bible at a club in North Korea and released after five months in detention. Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a Christian activist, was released from North Korea in 2010 after a visit to Pyongyang by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. CNN's KJ Kwon contributed to this report from Seoul, South Korea, and Tina Burnside from Atlanta.",

        "article": "(CNN)Britain's Lewis Hamilton made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the F1 season in Australia Sunday to lead a Mercedes one-two in Melbourne. Polesitter Hamilton controlled the race on the Albert Park street circuit to win from teammate Nico Rosberg of Germany. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel took the final podium position for his new team Ferrari, holding off Felipe Massa in the Willams. It was the 34th career victory for two-time world champion Hamilton and underlined the continued dominance of Mercedes as he and Rosberg pulled well clear of their nearest challengers. Hamilton, who was forced to retire early in last year's Australian Grand Prix, was taking the checkered flag in Melbourne for the first time since 2008, when he claimed his first world title for McLaren. It had all gone completely to plan until coming face to face on the victory podium with movie legend Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was conducting the post-race interviews. \"Hey man, WOW,\" said a surprised Hamilton. \"It is an incredibly feeling to continue winning but also great to be up here with you.\" Then taking his courage in his hands, Hamilton cheekily told 'The Terminator' \"I thought you were taller!\" After getting the thoughts of Rosberg and Vettel, who said it was a \"very big honor\" to gain his first points for Ferrari, Schwarzenegger turned his attention back to Hamilton. The pair signed off by saying together: \"I'll be back,\" the catchphrase from Schwarzenegger's iconic 1984 film. With Hamilton winning his seventh race from eight starts, his F1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and Rosberg admitted \"he was driving to his max\" but could not match the pace of his teammate. Only 11 cars finished the race from a depleted grid of 15 cars, with Valtteri Bottas unable to start for Williams due to a back injury. Pastor Maldonado crashed out on the first lap as the safety car was deployed, while his teammate Romain Grosjean retired early in the 58-lap race to complete a miserable afternoon for Lotus. Britain's Jenson Button in an uncompetitive McLaren was the only driver to finish without a point in 11th place. His regular teammate Fernando Alonso sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona, while stand-in Kevin Magnussen retired after the warm-up lap. Kimi Raikkonen looked set to underline Ferrari's improvement when running in fifth place, but had to retire the car, with TV replays indicating his left rear tire was not fitted properly after a pit stop. It left the way clear for rookie Felipe Nasr of Brazil to claim an unexpected fifth place for Sauber, which went through the 2014 season without claiming a single point, and also took eighth spot with Marcus Ericsson. Home hopes rested with Daniel Ricciardo, third in last year's title race, but he looked off the pace in the Red Bull in sixth place. Force India pair Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez finished seventh and 10th, with Carlos Sainz Jr. impressing on his F1 debut for Toro Rosso in ninth. Dutch teenager Max Verstappen made F1 history by becoming the youngest driver to compete in an F1 race at 17 years and 166 days, but his hopes were dashed when forced to retire in his Toro Rosso on the 34th lap.",

No one was injured in the mishap, which occurred about noon during the first run because of an \"isolated mechanical issue,\" a Luna Park spokeswoman said. The park's operations team helped each passenger down \"one by one,\" and the ride was closed the rest of the day for repairs, spokeswoman Erica Hoffman said. \"Safety is the number one priority for our guests here at Luna Park,\" Hoffman said. \"Nobody was injured, and those on the ride were safely evacuated and will be able to come ride again for free when it is open again.\" Images and videos shared on social media showed people slowly walking down the 88-year-old wooden roller coaster. \"That thing was the scariest thing I ever did,\" 24-year-old David Zubin told amNY of the walk down. \"The bricks, walking down, looked like it was going to break when you stepped on it.\" Steven Hernandez was waiting in line when the coaster got stuck. He and others watched in suspense, taking photos and video on their smartphones, as riders carefully climbed down stairs alongside the track. The 22-year-old from Brooklyn said he shows up for opening day at Luna Park every year. He heads straight to the Cyclone to be among the first 100 people who get to ride for free, he said. \"People were trying to figure out why the Cyclone got stuck at the top,\" he said. \"I go there every year, (and) that never happened.\" The Cyclone opened on June 26, 1927, during Coney Island's heyday as one of country's largest recreation areas. With more than 2,640 feet of track featuring 12 drops and 27 elevation changes, the Cyclone was long considered the standard against which \"compact wooden twisters\" were measured. An official New York City Landmark since July 12, 1988, Cyclone was listed in the New York State Register of Historic Places on June 31, 1991, according to NYC.com. Its status help preserve its spot in Coney Island after the Astroland amusement park closed in 2008 and reopened as Luna Park in 2009. See images of the situation . Hernandez received a complimentary ticket for his next ride after the park operators closed the ride for repairs. He looks forward to using it; the incident won't deter him from returning to the Cyclone, he said. \"I've been riding that ride since I was 14,\" he said. \"I love it.\" CNN's David Shortell contributed to this report.",

        "article": "The Chinese are certainly doing things by the book when it comes to their bid for world football domination. The most populous nation on the planet is in the process of producing a series of textbooks for children aimed at teaching them how to play the beautiful game. Football-mad president Xi Jinping has already made the sport a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse. Xi Jinping kicks a football during a 2012 visit to Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, when he was China's vice president. The football-mad leader wants to make set his country on the road to being world champions . Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books', says the man in charge of their creation\u00a0Chen Keqi . Xi Jinping has been a football fan since he played for his school team and is said to be very keen to see his country climb the world rankings . And now China's young players will hopefully have everything they need to become future World Cup winners thanks to the new tools at their disposal. According to the Chinese People's Daily, the first series of football textbooks for students in primary and secondary school will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP). Chen Keqi, director of the Sports Office at the PEP, says 30 football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' and primary and secondary school PE teachers. The texts feature tips on individual skills such as ball striking, dribbling and passing, but also place great stress on teamwork in order to 'cultivate students' will and character'. Mr Keqi said, 'Given the nature of this sport, the textbooks will highlight students' awareness of teamwork and cooperation. It is hoped the 3D young footballers will encourage China's budding players to become world beaters . Pupils will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . 'It will aim to cultivate their hard-working and optimistic spirit. All that reflects the educational value of football. 'We aim to improve students\u2019 overall ability and make them well-developed both in mind and body. 'Students\u2019 awareness of duty and responsibility can be raised in this process of learning.' 'Any type of education must take building people\u2019s characters and passing knowledge on to students into account, and PE education is no exception.' There are seven volumes of textbooks, four of which will be for primary, middle school and first year high school students, while the remaining three are teaching guides for primary and secondary school coaches. Pupils from primary grades 3-4 will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps, while students from secondary grades 5-6 will be learning some more 'complex' skills such as keeping a ball in the air using different parts of their feet. The books feature 3D pictures to help teach positional play and develop 'attacking strategy'. China's men's team. For a country of 1.37billion people their ranking of 82 does not sit well with Chinese fans . China's men take on Uruguay at the Wuhan Sports Center Stadium in October 2010. President Xi wants the country to qualify for a World Cup again, like they did in 2002, and eventually win the competition . They also have green QR codes which readers can scan with their mobile phones to access online football tutorial videos. Mr Keqi said: '3D technology brought football skills to life and graphics can be easily understood by students. 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books. 'In addition to publishing paper textbooks, we will introduce CD and online video tutorials to help teachers learn more about the sport. 'We will organise some training if possible to ensure teachers are best able to use the set of textbooks.' Prince William meets Mr Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier this month. The Aston Villa fan mentioned the Chinese president's love of football during their talk . Mr Xi is a massive fan of the beautiful game and he and many of his 1.37billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 82 ranking of the Chinese men's national team. He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup \u2013 they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score \u2013 will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it. At least China's women's team has a much better chance of doing that any time soon as they are currently ranked a much more respectable 13th in the world. On his recent visit to China Prince William bonded with Mr Xi over their mutual love of the round ball game. William, who is an Aston Villa fan, told the president: 'I also gather you're quite a football fan. I'm looking forward to learning about China's football'.",

        "article": "Nine wild beavers are to continue to live free on a Devon river after they passed health checks. The animals - the first wild beavers to breed in England for 800 years - were captured earlier this week and given crucial blood tests. Their clear results mean the beavers should be released back into the wild on the River Otter by the end of the month. A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river after passing health checks that included blood tests. Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, said the animals won't be put in a zoo, but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind . Ministers wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year. But Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind. Their approval last month was conditional on the beavers being assessed as free of the disease Echinococcus multilocularis, which can be harmful to humans. Now that tests have revealed that the four adult beavers are free of the disease, and if they pass a few more tests, they are set to be released onto the river. The Echinococcus multilocularis parasite is a small tapeworm. Its eggs can cause alveolar echinococcosis (AE) - a disease in humans brought on if a person swallows the tapeworm's eggs. High risk people include hunters, vets and other people who come into contact with carriers. This includes wild foxes, or coyotes, household dogs and cats or other animals that eat wild rodents infected with AE. Beavers may also pick up the eggs from their surroundings. Humans can be exposed to these eggs by 'hand-to-mouth' transfer or contamination. Devon Wildlife Trust, which will monitor the beavers for the next five years, said they had passed a \u2018vital hurdle\u2019 in one of the most important schemes in the history of English conservation. Beavers, which are native to England, were common in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. It later became clear there were nine of the animals, two pairs of breeding adults and five juveniles, and they had been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years. It was unclear where they came from \u2013 but they had thrived without any outside interference. Environmentalists were delighted at the unexpected finding, but were horrified when Defra, the Government\u2019s environment department, decided last year that they would round up the beavers. Officials said the animals posed a risk to other wildlife and might spread parasites and disease, and insisted they must be put in a zoo or even culled. That decision was reversed six weeks ago when Natural England granted Devon Wildlife Trust a licence to monitor the beavers as part of groundbreaking conservation programme. There are at least nine beavers thriving along a 12 mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter (shown on a map). They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago . The reason for the beavers\u2019 presence in Devon (pictured) remains a mystery. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes . The animals will be allowed to live naturally on the river, while wildlife experts monitor the impact they have on the environment. Dan Smith, communications officer at the Devon Wildlife Trust, said yesterday: \u2018The beavers are at a private site in Devon. They will be there until we get the rest of the results and then we can released them back on to the river, hopefully within a few weeks.\u2019 Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity. Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes. As well as being a rare victory for native English wildlife, conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment. Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: \u2018This is fantastic news for all the people who fought to save these beavers. We always expected them to be disease free, but it\u2019s wonderful to have it confirmed. \u2018We now need to get the beavers released back into the wild as soon as possible - and then get on with working to return the species to other suitable parts of the country too.\u2019 Environment minister Lord de Mauley said: \u2018I am very pleased that all four of the adult beavers have been tested by experts and found to be free of Echinococcus multilocularis, a disease which has the potential to be harmful to humans should it become established in the UK.\u2019 The reason for the beavers\u2019 presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including thirty miles away in western Devon, on the other side of Dartmoor. But none of the animals is unaccounted for. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown . Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams.

A 60-year-old man was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio where he had worked for 38 years. The victim has been identified locally as longtime employee William Haring. The shop where the fatal accident took place, Logan Machine Company, was previously found to be in violation of  numerous serious safety and health regulations. An Akron police spokesman said the accident occurred sometime between 10 p.m. Friday and around 4:45 a.m. Saturday, when co-workers found him. Co-workers used a crane to lift a large metal frame off the victim. The spokesman would not identify the man but said he lived in the Akron suburb of Green. Lt. Rick Edwards told WKYC the victim was William Haring, and that he was stuck in the middle of a workbench and a steel part. The causes of death were 'blunt force trauma' and 'crushing injuries to the torso,' the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office told the NBC affiliate. Ohio.com\u00a0reported that Haring had been a  foreman at Logan Machine Company. He was a company employee for 38 years, the website reported.

        "article": "(CNN)The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years. The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies. Jacob Russell's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters. Since last summer, international media -- and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour (\"girls with guns,\" as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer's assumptions about the woman's emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat. Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters. \"I was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters,\" he said. \"I think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by Kurdish leaders (who) know very well how attractive this image is to the Western media.\" Having lived in Kurdistan for nearly two years, Russell understands that many women join the Peshmerga or other Kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons. Many of the women he photographed turned to the Peshmerga to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"A lot of the women's backstories were quite difficult,\" he said. \"It seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal Kurdish society, because despite being relatively progressive (within the Middle East), it is still quite a conservative society.\" Russell explores the theme of sisterhood, and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck, their fingers intertwined. That photo, he says, is his favorite from the shoot. \"I think that image is one of the more expressive ones that (shows) what really seems to be going on there,\" he said. \"I didn't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of (ISIS) fighters. That just didn't seem to be the case.\" Russell remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role, conveying to the world the (relatively) progressive values that Kurds pride themselves on. The women now serve a political role, too. As Western governments eye more military engagement with Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria, these women may boost the Kurds' international standing.

After feeling out their environment, the combatants lock horns in battle to the death. The competitors begin by feeling out their environments before they approach each other and lock horns . Sensing its predator the scorpion turns and tries to make a run for it. But the beetle steamrolls forward and is undeterred by its competitor\u2019s sting. It dives at the scorpion's tail and clamps on with its powerful pincers. After coming face-to-face with the beetle, the scorpion tries to get away but its competitor clamps down on its tail .

Chasing the scorpion around the container, the beetle maintains its grip on the tail and hangs from it as its competitor attempts to make a getaway.

A retired NYPD cop who sifted through ten tons of debris from the September 11th attacks, reported seeing a ghostly lady at the Staten Island landfill, a new book reveals. However, Sgt. Frank Marra, 48, was not the only one who saw the specter, who a psychic medium has explained could have been a spirit, 'soul collector', guiding people to the afterlife, according to the New York Post. In his book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground, Marra details his experience searching through rubble and remains of the World Trade Center attacks from September 2001 to February 2002 at Fresh Kills landfill. While there, volunteers found 54,000 personal objects and helped identify 1,200 people who perished. The 17-year veteran cop shares about the spirit he and other volunteers saw at the Staten Island landfill, also known as 'The Hill'. This is where the African-American woman was spotted, dressed in white like a Red Cross worker during the Second World War,  carrying a tray of sandwiches. Sgt. Frank Marra, 48, was not the only one who saw the spectre, who a psychic medium has explained could have been a spirit 'soul collector' guiding people to the afterlife (above an excavator sifts through debris from the World Trade Center at Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island on January 14, 2002) In Marra's book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground, Marra details his experience searching through rubble and remains from September 2001 to February 2002 - where volunteers found 54,000 personal objects and 1,200 identities of those who perished (above a dirt-covered shoe found on October 24, 2001 at the Staten Island landfill) The spirit Marra and other cops reported seeing was an African-American woman, dressed in white like a Red Cross worker during the Second World War, was seen carrying a tray of sandwiches (above jewelry recovered from the World Trade Center debris held in a trailer at the Staten Island landfill in 2002) 'I thought she was trying to help, being first responders,' said Marra. He only saw her a few times and in the distance, more than 50 yards away each time, but he recalls that it clearly looked like a person. And while they were rare sightings, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost. The detective asked him if he ever heard stories about the 'old Red Cross worker trying to serve sandwiches and coffees out by the sifters', which brought Marra's memories of her rushing back to mind. 'It hit me like a ton of bricks - I had put that dormant,' said Marra. 'It just reminded me that I remembered seeing her.' While his sightings of the ghost were rare, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost (above damaged fire truck and debris from the World Trade Center attacks at the Fresh Kills landfill in 2002) Along with the Red Cross worker, other cops and volunteers witnessed seeing other things while in the landfill from shadows to large black masses (above NYPD officers who worked at Fresh Kills landfill bow their heads in front of a pile of debris on July 15, 2002 during the closing ceremony for the Staten Island landfill) The retired cop who now resides in New Jersey with his wife and three sons also notes how the landfill, with all of its memories from September 11, quickly became a holy ground (left debris and damaged fire trucks at the Staten Island landfill in 2002; right, Marra's book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground) Along with the Red Cross worker, other cops and volunteers witnessed seeing other things while in the landfill from shadows to large black masses, according to Marra. The retired cop who now resides in New Jersey with his wife and three sons also notes how the landfill, with its memories of the tragic September 11 attacks, quickly became a holy ground. Marra said: 'As time passed we realized how many people's ashes and DNA still remain at the landfill. 'It was clear this became a holy ground, a place of rest for many who would never be recovered, a cemetery without tombstones.'",

Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her tragic ex-partner was laid to rest in January, and appeared to be ready to rebuild her life. The reality TV star and fashion designed attended the UK premiere party for E!'s new show The Royals in London, with a smile on her face once more. Scroll down for video . Smiling again: Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her ex Scot Young's funeral . The 31-year-old American looked stunning in metallic shorts and a white vest as she beamed at photographers at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park on Tuesday evening. Miss Reno, star of Bravo's Ladies of London, suffered a shocking loss when her ex-fiance was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8 last year. Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. Recovering: Miss Reno attended the UK premiere party for The Royals at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park . Glammed up:\u00a0The 31-year-old American looked stunning in metallic shorts and a white vest . High profile: Mr Young, pictured with ex Noelle in 2012, became embroiled in one of the nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK with his ex-wife Michelle . Paying her respects: Noelle  attended her former partner's funeral in January this year . Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded \u00a3300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'. Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of \u00a320million and \u00a36million in legal costs. He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone. When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'. Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.",

        "article": "(CNN)In the two years since \"Lean In\" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do? Now the Facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too? That's certainly what Sandberg and her LeanIn.org colleagues are hoping, following their brand new partnership with the National Basketball Association and the Women's National Basketball Association and the creation of a public service campaign called #LeanInTogether. In a 30-second video of NBA and WNBA all-stars, we see James of the Cleveland Cavaliers holding up a poster, which says \"All-Star Dad.\" Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat says, \"When men lean in, everyone wins,\" and then touts how he leans in for his wife, mother and grandmother. \"Help women aim high,\" says Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks. The significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold, says Sandberg. To truly bring about equality at home and at work, men need to be part of the discussion, and we need to bring the discussion to where men are, she says. Sheryl Sandberg at BlogHer: Not every woman has to be a CEO . \"The conversation about equality has long existed by women, for women, in women's forums where women are, and that will continue, and that's important. But bringing it to the center of the court, bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like LeBron James and Steph Curry (of the Golden State Warriors) and Dwayne Wade, saying 'I'm in for equality and here's why' -- I think that could be transformative,\" said Sandberg in a phone interview. What Sandberg and LeanIn.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do, providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work, and as managers, as soon as they finish reading this story. Many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home. But Sandberg says with the list of \"simple, clear, everyday things, practical things\" men can do that are based on real data, men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit. For instance, research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier, mentally and physically, happier, have stronger emotional attachments and relationships, are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home, Sandberg said. For girls, there's an extra benefit, she said. By age 14, if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework, her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who don't see their fathers doing household chores, she said, pointing to a study by the University of British Columbia and published in a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. \"The way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level, no matter how active a mother is, do better -- a lot of men, particularly those with wives who are home (and who say) 'I'm covered. My kids are in good hands' ... they are motivated,\" said Sandberg. Despite 'Lean In,' workplace equality remains abysmal . Dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want, but if Mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning, their girls aren't getting the full message. \"What really matters is seeing what you do. You have to walk the walk. She needs to see equality to believe it.\" Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms. \"If you've long been in the majority and long held power, and you see change, you could naturally be nervous that this wasn't going to help you,\" said Sandberg. Men need to realize it's not a zero sum game, she said. \"When companies do better, there are more jobs, more promotions, more salaries for everyone. When companies do worse, there's less for everyone,\" she said. She mentioned a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the U.S., our country's gross domestic product would grow by 5%. \"We haven't seen 5% GDP growth in a long time. ... That's a lot of jobs for a lot of people, so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone, I think, is huge.\" Work-life balance not just a women's issue . Sandberg's #LeanInTogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality. Sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four-day conference on engaging men and boys that begins Thursday in New York. The conference is sponsored by The Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University. In January, a U.N. conference sponsored by Iceland and Suriname, which I was honored to attend as a panel participant, brought together ambassadors, other policymakers, and athletes and artists, with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality. An overriding message repeated at the conference was that we can't keep telling men what to do. We need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work. \"Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . That is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year's Super Bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist Michael Kimmel, who is spearheading this week's New York conference on men and masculinities. \"This provides a counternarrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see,\" Kimmel told me when I talked to him days before the Super Bowl. Kimmel said very few men, fewer than 10%, can relate to the way the media depict masculinity, according to a study conducted by Dove Men+Care. Kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research. Men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is the author of more than 20 books including \"Manhood in America: A Cultural History.\" Sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like James and Wade goes a long way toward doing that. \"I am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers, we can't fully accept women as leaders,\" she said. \"We've got to stop calling it 'Mommy and me.' As long as we are calling it 'Mommy and me,' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this.\" Admittedly impatient about gender equality (I'm impatient too!), Sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and LeanIn.org can close its doors. \"We have been fighting for equality for too long,\" she said, noting that women starting earning about 50% of college degrees back in 1981. \"Thirty-four years is plenty of time to get 50% of the top jobs, and we're not close. We're at 5(%) in the Fortune 500. And so we have to change, we have to change more. We have to get more people involved.\" Enter King James.

A student spoke out to the Today show to say that she had heard the 'there will never be a n***** in SAE' chant from members of the fraternity at least two years ago and that the brothers all thought it was a gas. 'I would definitely say this is not an isolated incident,' the student, who did not want to be named, told Today. Scroll down for video . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . 'It was really offensive to sit there and listen to that especially because they would just chant it and then laugh after and they thought it was funny.' Meanwhile, the national SAE headquarters announced that it was investigating reports of other incidents at other chapters across the country. The fraternity traces its founding back to 1856 at the University of Alabama - before the Civil War an the end of slavery. It has 218 active chapters, more than 15,000 student members and 325,000 alumni. The fraternity has chapters at the most prestigious universities in the country, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Duke, as well as some of the largest universities - including Texas A&M, Ohio State and Penn State. The SAE fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by University of Oklahoma officials . 'Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,' the fraternity said. However, the fraternity - which is now headquartered at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois - denied claims that the racist song sung by University of Oklahoma brothers was a widespread tradition. 'Some reports have alleged that the racist chant in the video is part of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon tradition, which is completely false. The fraternity has a number of songs that have be,' the statement said. The chant, which surfaced Sunday in a nine-second video, appears to be a well-known song to the fraternity brothers. As some members began singing it, others can be seen standing up to join in. SAE officials quickly disbanded the Oklahoma chapter of the fraternity and launched their own investigation following outrage over the clip.",

The latest study involved quizzing more than 1,700 Dutch men and women about their sex life and their need for intimacy. The volunteers, who ranged in age from 58 to 98, were also put through a battery of mental tests, designed to assess everything from memory to the ability to think abstractly. Two-thirds of the men and women had a partner and a similar number said that they still felt the need for intimacy. Those who were satisfied with their sex life and said that sexuality was important did better on the tests. The link was particularly strong in women, the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports. The researchers, from the Altrecht mental health centre, can\u2019t be sure if staying sexually active was keeping the brain or if interest in sex dwindles as the mind fails. However, previous research has credited having sex with the growth of new brain cells, in rats at least. It has also been suggested that doing a crossword is better for the brain than an orgasm \u2013 because it gives the whole brain a workout, rather than just one area of it. Researchers have found that rats can boost their brain power by having more sex than normal . The Dutch researchers said it is important not to assume that sex is just for the young. They wrote: \u2018Many beliefs about sexual behaviour in older populations are based on personal and stereotyped views of ageing and sexuality. \u2018Older persons are generally expected to no longer be capable of or to be lacking interest in sex when, in reality, many elderly persons require sexuality to be important and wish to remain sexually active as they age. \u2018Age itself is no adequate predictor of sexuality; the reality of ageing is that most people continue to have sexual feelings of some sort.\u2019 ends .",

Since leaving This Morning, the 57-year-old has carved out a successful career as a novelist alongside her TV work and as she sparkles as this month's Good Housekeeping cover girl. In the interview, Fern talks about how she's over worrying about the signs of ageing: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life!' She adds: 'I am vain about being as fit as I can be \u2013 not about my wrinkles. I\u2019ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked myself out of it.

Touching on the depression that has affected her in the past the presenter admits to feeling angry about it, but says that she's starting to understand it more. She says: 'I haven\u2019t had an episode for a long time. I\u2019m cross that it\u2019s been there and that it lurks around, but I\u2019ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don\u2019t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. 'Because I knew it would pass.

A Russian tycoon exiled in London who is fighting a freeze on his \u00a31.3billion in assets by the High Court has claimed he is now a 'poor man' who cannot afford to support his family. Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for him and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, to support their home. Last year it was reported the couple, who have three children and own a \u00a312million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor. And Ms Tolstoy, 41, said it was hard to live on the \u00a310,000-a-week allowed by the court. Mr Pugachev, the former billionaire business partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley is accused in Moscow of siphoning more than \u00a3655million in funds from Mezhprombank, which filed for insolvency in 2010, including $700 million in Russian Central Bank bailout money. The 52-year-old former tycoon, who denies any wrongdoing, complained the freeze has left him unable to support Tolstoy who said last year it was hard to live on the \u00a310,000 a week allowed by the court. 'I can be called a poor man. I do not have money to support my family and my property, and this is more important than paying the lawyers,' he told Vedomosti newspaper in Moscow, blaming the arrest of his bank accounts and assets. He said he has borrowed $5 million towards his $10 million legal bill, but was now unable to take more loans because his assets were frozen. As a result, he has dispensed with his lawyers. Last year, his  socialite partner - a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy - said 'we are just surviving' on the \u00a310,000 a week allowance. The Deposit Insurance Agency in Moscow, which is taking the legal action, claim the 'statements of his partner Alexandra Tolstoy' about their lifestyle belie 'his declarations about financial difficulties'. A source claimed his move to dispense with his British lawyers 'looks like a tactical trick and is aimed at making obstacles for English justice'. Last week a London Court of Appeal judge ruled that Pugachev, also previously nicknamed 'cashier to the Kremlin', must disclose further information about trusts he uses to bolster his income. Lavish:\u00a0Last year it was reported the couple, pictured together, who have three children and own a \u00a312million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor . 'Sophisticated and wily operators should not be able to make themselves immune to the courts' orders,' said the judge. Pugachev claims he is the victim of a 'politically motivated' asset grab by figures in the Russan elite of which he was a member before fleeing to London. His property was 'expropriated by the state and by private persons', and sold at rock bottom prices, he claimed. He also alleged in court that a senior Deposit Insurance Agency official earlier made 'a brazen attempt to extort money' from him, and threatened that 'he or his family could be physically harmed'. In November, Interpol put Pugachev on its wanted list at Russia's request, with Putin's spokesman alleging: 'He built up huge amounts of debts and then ran away.' Struggle: Ms Tolstoy, pictured, said 'she and her husband are just surviving' on the \u00a310,000 a week allowance . Faced by the legal moves in Moscow, Pugachev in October blasted Putin, claiming all Russian businessmen are now 'serfs' under his total control. 'Today in Russia there is no private property. There are only serfs who belong to Putin,' he told the Financial Times, in a blunt warning over the collapse of regulated capitalism in his homeland. 'Now there is Putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of Putin,' he alleged. 'The country is in a state of war. And therefore big business cannot live as before. It has to live under military rules.' He alleged: 'If Putin says he wants to buy something, you cannot say that you do not want to sell. 'If he says 'I want to buy something' then you say, 'Thanks for saying you want to buy it, and not just taking it.'",

        "article": "The Delphina Valle dell'Erica resort in Sardinia is huge. Even the name is on the big side and when I looked at its website I had misgivings, not least because I have stayed in so many unwieldy hotels around the world that I always long for something small and personal. I had visions of elbowing fellow holidaymakers at the breakfast buffet and setting the alarm to grab a sun lounger that might actually face the sun. Mum's the word: Jodie and her son Indio enjoyed their first trip to Sardinia . What's more, this was to be an important holiday for my three-year-old son, Indio, and neither of us had been to this Italian island before. But, from the moment we set foot in the 28-hectare resort near Santa Teresa Gallura, I realised my worries were entirely misplaced. Frankly, we were bowled over. Yes, it is big - in fact it is really two hotels joined together - but it never felt big and there were days when we hardly saw a soul. It helps, of course, that there are five or six different beaches to choose from, four swimming pools (three with salt water), five restaurants, five bars, a mini football pitch and golf course. Our room faced the sea. On clear days we could see Corsica looming over the Strait of Bonifacio and every evening we were treated to spectacular sunsets. Whoever designed this place should take a bow. There were children's areas, adults-only areas, family areas and ones where no one seemed to go at all. Everywhere there was an abundance of trees, shrubs and pots spilling over with all the colours of the Mediterranean. You could potter about for hours along shaded walkways as if wandering around your own private garden. The word that kept coming into my mind was 'tranquil', which, given there are more than 250 rooms, is amazing. Even the staff seemed completely relaxed, but they were also highly efficient and went out of their way to make everyone feel special. On a couple of occasions I arranged for a babysitter for Indio and, believe me, I am not a mother who readily leaves her child with a total stranger. But I trusted them completely and Indio seemed to look forward to their arrival. There were very few British people staying - and lots of Italians. I took that as a good sign because Italians love children. They also love food and wine and are at their best in the sunshine. Come to think of it, food, wine and sunshine rate high on my own list of priorities \u2014 especially food, after MasterChef, where to my astonishment I reached the final. The big morning decision was whether to make camp by the pool or on one of the beaches. Bolts from the blue: The hotel sits on the serene waters of the Strait of Bonifacio . I liked having that choice and what I liked especially was that the beaches were quiet and not overrun with jet skiers. One day, I dropped Indio off at the kids' club and booked in for a day of windsurfing and kitesurfing. I learned to windsurf in Barbados, where my mother and brother still live and where I try to visit as often as I can. But I had never attempted kite-surfing. Kite-surfing is great fun once you get the hang of it - and you need a good teacher. It's also fantastic exercise, because it depends a lot on core muscles and, as we are relentlessly told by fitness gurus, it's those core muscles that form the basis of a well-toned body. With kitesurfing, you first have to learn how to fly a kite, which means getting to grips with the direction of the wind. In fact, there's a lot of preparation work to do before going on the water and having a board strapped to your feet. I seemed to get the hang of it. Perhaps our best day was when we went out on Poseidon, one of the resort's fishing boats. We went exploring around the north point and then visited the island of Maddalena. It was magical - and the ice creams were the best ever. We called in at the church of Santa Maria Maddalena and then I swam back to the boat and was met with drinks and canapes. Delphina has a Thalasso spa, where I spent as much time as I could. It has lots of jets that pummel your body into submission but afterwards you feel amazingly invigorated and ready to conquer the world. Actually, I think Indio and I both felt ready to conquer something or other after our a week at Delphina. More importantly, our holiday worked brilliantly for both of us. I know we will be back and just hope it's soon.

        "article": "You can normally find him asleep in his basket under the vaulted splendour of his home, or washing his whiskers in the altar font. From time to time he will strut haughtily past a congregation at prayer, patrolling his territory on the lookout for mice. Louis the cat is so popular with folk at Wells Cathedral \u2013 home to the Bishop of Bath and Wells \u2013 that he has become the feline hero of a children's book, and even has his own merchandise stall in the cathedral shop. Louis the cat is often found sleeping by his favourite radiator in Wells cathedral in Somerset . Louis, the 17-year-old Wells cathedral cat, sits in his basket at the gift shop - but local owners have accused him of turning nasty and attacking dogs 'like a wild lion' The popular cat has been linked to at least three dogfights recently and locals fear there could be more . But yesterday the 17-year-old ginger tom's money-spinning empire was in danger of crumbling after he was accused of turning nasty \u2013 and attacking dogs 'like a wild lion'. He has been linked to at least three fights with dogs in recent weeks and locals fear there could be more. As news of the scandal spread, however, a 'Fans of Louis' group sprang to the moggy's defence. And cathedral staff suggested he could be a victim of mistaken identity, quickly issuing a statement which claimed there were 'at least two other ginger cats in the area who also enjoy strolling through the streets of Wells'. Louis became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago. His principal role was to rid the 12th century building of mice. Such was the esteem in which the rather solitary cat was held, the cathedral generated a regular fund-raising trade in Louis fridge magnets, pencils, mugs and other Louis-related trinkets, including an \u00a38.99 paperweight and a \u00a35.99 candle-snuffer. He would later star in a YouTube video narrated affectionately by the head verger. Louis is so popular in Wells that he has become the subject of a children's book, Louis the Cathedral Cat . But out there on the mean streets, it is alleged, he became a dangerous, feral beast. 'He pounced like a wild lion in the jungle on to my dog Millie's head,' said Mandie Stone-Outten, describing his alleged attack on her springer spaniel outside the Present Company gift shop in the nearby Market Place. 'We were just looking in the window of the shop and the cat was sitting outside. He walked towards us. He was staring at the dog, the dog was staring at the cat. 'Then suddenly, so quickly, it was attacking my dog's head. He turned into a cat about four times the size and he was waving his arms around. 'I tried to pull the lead back, but I went flying back and fell off the pavement into the gully. It had been raining and I was covered in mud. It hurt all down my right side, it was so painful. 'A couple of people told me it was Louis the cathedral cat and that he was semi-feral and he did sometimes go a bit crazy.' The 48-year-old, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, added: 'I went back with my son and his girlfriend a couple of days later. We went into the cathedral and I saw the cat asleep in a basket sitting behind the till. 'We started stroking it and it was just like a little teddy bear. I couldn't believe that it was the same cat. 'That cat has serious issues. Be aware \u2013 this ball of fluff is not as cute and cuddly as he looks.' Louis quickly became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago . The Cathedral staff believe he is a victim of mistaken identity and is being unjustly persecuted . Debbie Sheppard, who works in the Present Company shop, overheard the commotion. 'The next thing I heard was this hissing,' she said. 'When I looked outside, Louis was walking up the street looking very subdued.' But she added: 'He's a very sweet cat and I certainly don't think he's suddenly turned nasty.' Attack number two also put Louis in the frame. Zoe Heath described how her brother's dog was set upon by a big ginger cat at the cathedral's magnificent west front, part of Louis's regular domain. 'His dog nearly lost an eye,' she said. 'We all assumed it was Louis.' The cathedral cat can regularly be spotted snoozing next to the radiator in Wells cathedral, Somerset . Attack number three is said to have been witnessed by town crier Len Sweales, although details remain inconclusive. Zoe said: 'He told me that Louis has a lookalike and he thinks it was the other ginger who would have launched the attack.' So does Louis have a Jekyll and Hyde personality? Or are there truly doppelganger moggies prowling the streets? Supporters said the cat had never shown any aggressive tendencies and was 'sweet natured if somewhat aloof'. One 'Fans of Louis' member, who has known the cat for five years, wrote of the attack allegations: 'For an old guy who spends most of his day sound asleep in a basket in the cathedral shop, it must have taken an event of magnitude to have caused such a reaction. Be honoured \u2013 we may not see such an event again in our lifetime.' The 17-year-old can normally be found fast asleep in a basket in the gift shop at Wells cathedral .",

        "article": "A student recorded vice principal Joseph Defillipo having a discussion with one student and saying: 'I just don't like the black kids' A school vice-principal has been suspended after making a racist remark which was caught on video. Joseph Defillipo from Scandinavian Middle School in Fresno, California, was recorded by a student's cellphone, saying: 'I just don't like the black kids.' Defillipo had been in the middle of a discussion with several students about who he didn't like at the school. The 20-second clip cuts off after the teacher's racially-insensitive comment. The vice principal has taught in the district for 18 years and has been at the middle school since 2010. The video was posted to YouTube on Friday where it has been watched more than 4,000 times. It was brought to the school's attention by a parent of the student involved. Scandinavian Middle School refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Wednesday. Daily Mail Online was also waiting on a comment from the school district. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday\u00a0the school said Defillipo had been put on paid administrative leave while an third-party, external investigation took place. A school statement read: 'Fresno Unified takes great pride in providing a positive learning environment for all students and staff. The interaction between the Scandinavian student and our employee has been brought to our attention and we are conducting an investigation. 'Fresno Unified takes this matter very seriously and we will take any necessary actions pending the results. During our investigation, and as a matter of practice, the employee is on paid administrative leave.' Several parents whose children attend Scandinavian Middle School told The Fresno Bee\u00a0that they want Defillipo\u00a0fired. A group of former students gathered outside the school premises on Tuesday to protest, chanting: 'I love black people' and 'black power'. Around 10 per cent of students at Scandinavian Middle School are black, The Fresno Bee reported. The vice principal earns around $87,000 a year, according to public records. The YouTube video attracted a number of comments, both attacking and in defense of the senior teacher. One commenter, Kevin Hill, wrote: 'I'd withhold any judgment until the rest of the video comes out. First, he was talking to black mids [sic], most likely joking, inappropriate, yeah but not racist. Second, the way the video cuts immediately out indicates that there was more said which in context would've shown he was joking.' Alyssa Hochstetler wrote: 'why would he say that? im so glad i left that school.'

        "article": "A woman who married a man she met as a teenager still sees him as a young man - because she lost her sight by the time they'd been reunited. Joanne Roberts, now 47, met David at a holiday camp in Scotland when she was five years old but love didn't blossom initially for the pair. They later reunited at his brother's 40th - and ended up falling in love and tying the knot. However, Joanne had gone blind by then so still pictures him as the young man she met all those years ago. Joanne Roberts, now 47, met David when they were children but they lost touch. By the time they had reunited, she had lost her sight so still remembers him as a young man . Speaking to FEMAIL about her love story, she said: 'I can\u2019t really remember Dave until about the age of 9 or 10. Then he was a \"man\" of 16 and that's my last memory. 'He was always very funny and we bonded over humour. We laughed at exactly the same things, and remember: he\u2019s almost a Scouser and I\u2019m almost a Geordie. Whenever they get together there\u2019s always a few sparks.' The couple, pictured on holiday in 2010, later reunited at his brother's 40th and soon married . Joanne, pictured, left, in her twenties, went blind at 34 due to type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 14 and has now penned a book from the point of view of her guide dog, Uska, right . Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest. Meanwhile, Joanne, from Little Sutton, Cheshire, was enjoying a career as a high-flying businesswoman, whose work in marketing took her to Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. After returning to London, she set up a marketing agency and was enjoying life as a city dweller until she tragically lost her sight. Joanne went blind at 34 due to type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 14. As well as losing her sight,  Joanne\u2019s kidney function is half of a healthy person. She was also forced to have a pancreas transplant six years ago to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks. Before she lost her sight, Joanne was enjoying a career as a high-flying businesswoman, whose work in marketing took her to Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia . Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest but they bonded over their humour . After her diagnosis, Joanne attended Dave's brother's 40th birthday celebrations and she and Dave got on so well, it was clear that something was blossoming between the pair. They married in 2008 and Joanne credits Dave for helping her come to terms with losing her sight and helping her stay positive. 'He\u2019s helped me by challenging me to do stuff I\u2019ve never done before,' she said. 'I ride pillion on his motorbike and go away in a motorhome. Also, he doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, and won\u2019t let me play on my disability to get out of anything. 'Best of all, he still makes me laugh like no one else can.' The couple married in 2008 and Joanne credits Dave for helping her come to terms with losing her sight . Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog,  written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years . As well as Dave helping her come to terms with losing her sight, her guide dog Uska has become an indispensable part of her life - and even walked her down the aisle when she married Dave. Speaking about her dog, she said: 'Yes there were many serious issues facing me when I went blind, but gradually, like the easing of grief after the death of someone you love, I realised I could cope without my eyes. 'I was lucky because I never lost my sense of humour. Then I got Uska. As well as the freedom and self-respect of independence, his character brought me laughter every day. Is it any wonder I love this dog like my own flesh and blood?'. Her guide dog Uska has become an indispensable part of her life - and even walked her down the aisle when she married Dave . And now, Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog, which is written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years, Uska. Speaking about her new book written in honour of her dog, Joanne said: 'It's about life with my fabulous, laid-back guide dog. However, back in the beginning there were a few mishaps and occasional guiding disasters as we learnt how to work together. 'These have gained legendary status and aim to shed a little light on the funnier side of a blind person\u2019s life.' The story of their first year together is available to download from Apple or Amazon Books, with 25 per cent of her royalties going to Guide Dogs for the Blind. Joanne hopes to raise enough money to sponsor another Guide Dog and be able to name him USKA II, after her boy.",

        "article": "A former chief constable is being sued by the police force where he used to work in a bid to recover \u00a385,000 in 'golden handcuffs' payments he received for staying in his job. Roger Baker was employed by Essex Police on a salary of \u00a3139,000, but bonuses and expenses took his total pay above \u00a3200,000 a year. The payments included \u00a385,000 to reward him for staying at the force - but the area's police commissioner now disputes these bonuses, and has launched a legal challenge to claw them back. Mr Baker was chief constable of Essex Police between 2005 and 2009, when he left the force with a \u00a360,000 bonus for three months' work. Row: Roger Baker, left, was paid \u00a385,000 by Essex Police in a 'golden handcuffs' deal which is now being challenged by police commissioner Nick Alston, right . He went on to work for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police watchdog, where he was responsible for monitoring 'value for money' in police forces around the country. The 56-year-old former policeman is now a director at Colchester Hospital, paid \u00a311,000 a year for working four days out of every month. Mr Baker was deputy chief constable of North Yorkshire police before moving to Essex, where he forged a reputation as an advocate of 'bobbies on the beat'. He became known for controversial policies such as banning officers from wearing sunglasses when they talked to the public, and was criticised in a report because he insisted on sending an officer to the scene of every single reported crime. Roger Baker gained a reputation as an outspoken advocate of beat policing during his time as chief constable of Essex Police - but officials accused him of wasting taxpayers' money on needless intervention. The 56-year-old spent 32 years as a police officer, starting his career in Derbyshire before becoming assistant chief constable of Staffordshire Police and deputy chief constable of North Yorkshire Police. In 2005, he was appointed as the top officer in Essex, where he courted controversy with his traditionalist brand of policing. Mr Baker instructed officers to interview everyone who claimed to be a victim of a crime, rather than simply giving them a reference number, and also targeted low-level criminality such as vandalism. After the police watchdog said that attending every crime scene 'is not always necessary and can be time-consuming', Conservative MPs stood up for Mr Baker's unconventional methods. He retired from the force in July 2009, and soon took a new job with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, where he monitored police forces for whether or not they were providing value for money. Mr Baker then led a review of police relationships with the media and other external bodies, before stepping down from HMIC last year. The area's now-defunct police authority is understood to have given Mr Baker three payments totalling \u00a385,000 to reward him for his loyalty to the force. In total, he was paid around \u00a3150,000 in bonuses and expenses for his last 15 months of work at Essex Police. Essex police and crime commissioner Nick Alston claimed in 2013 that Mr Baker's 'golden handcuffs' deal fell outside payment regulations set by the Home Secretary. He said today: 'I have continued to progress this matter robustly, always seeking to achieve a resolution that is in the best interests of the people of Essex. 'I can confirm that I have now commenced legal proceedings to seek to recover \u00a385,000 plus interest from Mr Baker. 'As legal proceedings are now active, I am unable to say anything further about this specific case.' Mr Baker was unavailable to comment on the controversy. Last month, it emerged that the former chief constable of Cleveland Police would be able to keep the vast majority of a \u00a3500,000 bonus pot which the force claimed had been wrongly paid to him. Sean Price agreed to repay just \u00a323,000 despite being sacked from his job after lying about the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter. In 2013, North Yorkshire's police commissioner was forced to abandon her attempt to reclaim \u00a3100,000 in allowances paid to the force's former chief constable and his deputy. The pay of chief police officers is now being investigated for the first time by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which provides independent advice to the Government.",

        "article": "A report into the death of Joe Lawton, 17, who killed himself after being arrested for drink driving, has confirmed 'failings' at the station where he was held . A report into the death of an A-grade student who killed himself days after being arrested for drink driving found 'evidence of a concerning culture' at the police station where he was held. Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself dead at his parent's \u00a3850,000 home in Disley, Stockport, two days after being held at Cheadle Heath police station for drink driving. During an inquest into his death, lawyers for his parents claimed that police had mocked him for his middle class upbringing and his new car, contributing to his death. Now an Independent Police Complaints Commission\u00a0report into Mr Lawton's death, made public for the first time, confirms there were 'failings' at Cheadle Heath police station where the teen was held. The IPCC probe, which was kept hidden from the teen's inquest but has been revealed by the Manchester Evening News, uncovered 'evidence of a concerning culture' at Cheadle Heath. Following the report one Greater Manchester Police sergeant was moved from custody duty due to \u2018inappropriate behaviour\u2019, while another was given \u2018management advice\u2019, the report says. Two custody detention officers were also subjected to sanctions as a result of the investigation, according to a copy of the IPCC report obtained by the Manchester Evening News. Mr Lawton was stopped by police in\u00a0Hazel Grove in August 2012 while driving his new Peugeot 207 home from a party, just weeks after passing his test. A\u00a0breathalyzer showed he was over the drink drive limit and he was arrested. Lawyers for Mr Lawton's parents Nick and Jane (pictured) told an inquest their son was bullied for his middle class upbringing. The report, revealed today, found\u00a0'evidence of a concerning culture' among police . The teen, who had recently gained one A and four Bs in his AS-Levels and was working on his university application and travel plans, was then held for seven hours overnight. But due to an 'anomaly' in custody laws meaning 17-year-olds are treated as adults, Mr Lawton's parents Nick and Jane were not informed of the arrest after he opted not to tell them. Two days later he was found dead at home by his father. Next to the body was the police charge sheet, and a note saying he thought he had 'ruined his life'. His parents have since led a successful campaign to have the age limit raised to 18, after an inquest was told Mr Lawton's suicide could \u2018very likely\u2019 have been avoided if they were informed. The IPCC report, together with a response from Greater Manchester Police, were prepared in time for the inquest but were not submitted as evidence, meaning this is the first time they have been made public. Nick and Jane Lawton said the inquest was turned into a \u2018gruelling and frustrating\u2019 process by the police's failure to reveal the reports. In a statement, they hit out at the \u2018behaviour and attitude of the custody officers\u2019, adding: 'We love Joe and will continue to miss him every day for the rest of our lives.' Mr Lawton's parents were not informed that their son had been arrested in August 2012 due to an 'anomaly' in custody laws. Parents Nick and Jane (pictured) have since successfully campaign to have the law changed . The IPCC said the force has said it has \u2018learned lessons and had been improving working practice\u2019. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who gave evidence at the inquest, said: 'Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Joseph Lawton, and we sympathise with the issues they have raised following this tragedy. 'When Joseph died in 2012 there was a confusing anomaly where the Police and Criminal Evidence act led the police to treat 17-year-olds as adults, whilst the Children\u2019s Act stated that 17-year-olds should be treated as children. 'Following the case and a judicial review in 2013 the government have changed the legislation relating to 17-year-olds in custody. 'The new legislation states that when a 17-year-old is arrested they are now treated as children for the purposes of informing people about the child\u2019s detention. 'While in custody Joseph made the decision that he did not want anyone to be informed of his arrest. However, if this happened today we would have informed his parents.'",

        "article": "A 35-year-old man who lost 500 pounds must now wear compression garments to\u00a0stabilize all his excess skin and says he is still trapped inside his 'own fat suit.' Thomas Towle III, from Gardiner, Maine, admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight. After being a big child, he became even more overweight when he was a teenager and Towle was forced to drop out of high school when he became too embarrassed of his size, reports the Press Herald. Thomas Towle III, from Portland, (seen on right with a friend)\u00a0lost 500 pounds, but must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin . Towle admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight . 'I did an amazing job, I think, of putting a great face on, letting no one know how much being that heavy bothered me,' he said. At one point he weighed almost 800lbs. 'I made jokes at myself to survive. If someone was making fun of me, I made fun of myself harder. That way your jokes didn't hurt me, or at least you thought they didn't hurt me. Inside, it was a totally different story. It crushed me inside.' Towle tried several diets which all worked but as soon as he pulled back, he put the weight on again. He eventually began to lose weight when he got a job at McDonald's and he left the house and moved around more. He said that although he suffered pain in his joints from the excess weight they supported, he was able to sit down on a stool and serve customers. Towle and a friend fit now fit into the shirt he used to wear before he lost weight . He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds . 'I learned to work at McDonald's, and I lost weight,' he said. 'I was actually getting out of the house. Even though I might not have been standing up and doing exercise, I think the motion, the actual getting out, was a big first step in losing some of that weight.' He lost about 200 pounds through an improved diet and additional exercise, bringing him down to 600 pounds. Eventually Towle decided to have weight-loss surgery, although he had to lose another 50 pounds to be a safe weight to have the operation. In June 2011, Towle underwent gastric bypass surgery and a portion of his stomach was used to create a second smaller stomach. Towle can no longer eat some of his favorite foods as a result because they can make him vomit. He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds. But he has has to wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin. He says his faces a daily regime of three compression garments everyday as well as creams and powders to treat his extensive rashes and dry tearing skin. Towle needs reconstructive surgeries to remove the excess skin from his chest, abdomen and legs. The procedures are predicted to cost close to $30,000 and Towle thinks his insurance company will pay for at least a portion of the bill, but he is now appealing for help in paying the rest of it on his\u00a0Go Fund Me\u00a0page. He wrote: 'I am still trapped inside my own fat suit of skin that just hangs there and affects my everyday life, making it depressing to think I have come so far yet I am still trapped. 'I am asking you to please help me shed this one last obstacle in the way between me and a true new beginning a life that can be lived to the fullest. 'I wish insurance understood I don't want to be the next sex symbol I just want to be free of this burden.'",

        "article": "A Michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 Dodge Intrepid for almost nine years. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to Nantucket in their car, which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles. They can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up, the couple told Daily Mail Online. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, completed their journey to the lower 48 states' 3,108 counties when they arrived in Nantucket, their last county, with their green 1999 Dodge Intrepid . They have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006, though the Riehls bought a GPS device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the US where the streets aren't labelled. Jennifer Riehl, 32, a research scientist at Michigan Technological University, and her husband, 31, an engineering instructor at the institution, typically drove about 50,000 miles a year. Jonathan, who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates, hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are 'genuinely baffled' by the accomplishment. Mr Riehl bought the car as a high school senior living in New Jersey for $9,000. At the time, 2002, it had 70,000 miles. The couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since, including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather, according to\u00a0The Cape Cod Times. The car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties, and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16-hour days on the road. They think a 15,000-mile trip from New Jersey to Alaska to their home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car. First counties visited by the couple, which met in upstate New York, include many Northeastern destinations where they visited friends. Jonathan, who works with geographical information science computer programs, saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips. A move to Nashville, Tennessee, for two years, sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties. The contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii brings the total to 3,143 . The couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on Tuesday during their spring break trip. Above, pictured in Plymouth, Mass on Wednesday. The couple has already visited some boroughs of Alaska, but plans on finishing the state and starting on Hawaii. Jennifer's mother lives in Texas, but the travelers don't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit. They have spent days going to the southern state by route of California or Idaho, most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the Gem State during previous journeys. Their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. With academic schedules, the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school, including winter holidays where they truck through snow. Jonathan proposed to Jennifer on a 2011 trip to Manitoba, Canada, where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three Mexican states. However, their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to Winnepeg in blinding snow with Jennifer keeping track of the road's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove. The couple often taken the long route to friends' and relatives' houses, going from Michigan to Texas via California or Idaho. The car, which Jonathan bought in 2002, still has the same engine . The couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible. Above, Jennifer stands in Golden Valley County, Montana, in 2012 . Oscar Voss of the nonprofit national Extra Miler Club, a travel group where the Riehls are members, says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car. The club lists 38 people who have 'bagged' all 3,143 counties in the entire US, the first being Ed Dietz and Arthur Palmer in 1976. Most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60, according to the club's Valerie Naylor. The Riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals, such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points. Jonathan and Jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can. Jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and Jennifer likes to hike all over the country. As a pair they have also visited motels in each of the 48 states but Delaware and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels, hearing stories from a variety of locals. Jonathan, who is doing his doctoral research on urban sprawl, said that all of the best places are away from major highways. Jennifer said that the trips 'give me a perspective about what places and life are like that you just don't get from the interstate.' The pair began their journeys with trips around the Northeast. Above, the travelers stand in a New Jersey wood by Jonathan's uncle's house . Jonathan and Jennifer say they can navigate small towns just because they know how they are set up. Above, Paul Bunyan and his ox Blue in Bemidji, Minnesota, near the Mississippi River's headwaters . The university employees don't go out looking for particular adventures, and just try to enjoy meeting people along the way. After failing to drive through Baxter State Park in Maine because of heavy snow, the couple reattempted to make their way through the forest again in June 2006 only to find that a bridge was completely out. The Riehls were surprised when construction crews near the site were able to build a structure just for them so they could cross the river. In Ohio they found a man going cross-country alongside a road where he was walking his dog and rolling a globe. They don't play children's car games and occasionally listen to XM radio, but spend most of their time in the car catching up on each other's lives. 'I guess we must still like each other, or else we would have gone insane by now,' Mrs Riehl said. The travelers will end their spring break trip by driving to New Jersey before heading back to Michigan and working next week. The couple. who both work at Michigan Technological University, have been going to different counties together since 2006 and drive about 50,000 miles a year .",

        "article": "(CNN)One is a 21-year-old California man accused of trying to travel to Syria to join ISIS. Another, a 17-year-old Virginia student charged with helping recruit for the radical Islamist group. Charges against both were released Wednesday, and they are just the latest in a growing number of similar cases from the United States. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the terror group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. It's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Here are some of their stories: . Arrested at George H.W. Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport before a flight to Europe, Wolfe was charged in June \"with attempting to provide material support to terrorists,\" authorities said. He \"planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in Syria,\" according to a complaint. On February 2, 2014, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials said. Wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of ISIS, they said. The 18-year-old from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, pleaded guilty at a Minneapolis federal court to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS . Yusuf was stopped by the FBI from boarding a flight to Turkey from Minneapolis/Saint Paul Airport in May. Yusuf and another man, Abdi Nur, were charged in late November with conspiring to aid ISIS. Conley's plan to join ISIS and serve as a nurse at a jihadist camp ended in September with a guilty plea on a terror charge in a Colorado federal court. Arrested in April, the 19-year-old was at Denver International Airport about to embark on a journey to Germany and eventually to an ISIS camp near the Turkish border. She told investigators she was going to Turkey to await word from her suitor, an ISIS member she met on the Internet, whom she planned to marry. The Cincinnati 20-year-old was on the FBI's radar for months as he posted about violent jihad on social media. The feds said they arrested him before he could hatch his alleged plot. Reminiscent of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, he planned to set off pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol, and when employees and lawmakers fled the building, he and an accomplice would shoot them, according to a criminal complaint. Cornell allegedly told an informant he had been in contact with people overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. The attack, according to the complaint, would be a way of supporting the extremist group. The Stoughton, Massachusetts, man was first placed on the FBI terror list for 2009 crimes but since has been suspected of joining ISIS, officials said. He's fluent in both English and Arabic, and if his college degree in computers is any indication, he has a way with technology. Then there's his interest in radical Islam. Put it all together, and authorities said former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a good fit inside the ISIS social media machine that's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda across social media. The son of a Palestinian father and Italian-American mother, the 22-year-old from Vero Beach, Florida, is believed to be the first American suicide bomber to die in Syria. The former high school football playecr killed himself in May 2014 when he drove a truck full of explosives into a Syrian army position and detonated it, U.S. officials said. Three teenage girls who set out from a Denver suburb apparently bound for Syria to join extremists were sent home to their parents after they were stopped in Germany, U.S. officials said. The teens -- two sisters of Somali descent and a friend whose family is Sudanese, according to a Denver community leader -- were detained when their flight landed in Frankfurt on Friday after the FBI flagged their passports. The 21-year-old California man was arrested last summer, but was indicted on Wednesday. The FBI said he attempted to offer himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS. His arraignment is scheduled for later this month. The 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The teen lives in a suburb of Washington and is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there. The student is also accused of distributing ISIS messages. Arrested last month in New York and Florida, they are accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering plans to kill the President and shoot law enforcement officers. The three men face charges that include attempting and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. None were U.S. citizens, but Saidakhmetov, 19, and Juraboev, 24, had permanent resident status. Habibov, 30, was in the United States legally, but overstayed his visa, police said. The 20-year-old was charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Nur \"conspired to join ISIL and travel from Minnesota to the Middle East to engage in a campaign of terror,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in November, using another acronym for ISIS. Kahn was arrested at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in October. The 19-year-old is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. In a letter to his parents, Kahn wrote that he was leaving the United States and on the way to join ISIS, court documents said. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. This 33-year-old man from New Hope, Minnesota, died in late August while fighting for ISIS, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. McCain's uncle said his nephew had gone to Syria to fight as a jihadi. The 19-year-old Somali-American woman slipped away from her parents in late August. She told them she was going to a bridal shower, but instead hopped a flight to Turkey and joined ISIS, Reuters reported. Another woman is suspected of helping her leave the country. U.S. authorities said he is an ISIS sympathizer.  Morgan was arrested on August 2 on arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Frankfurt, Germany. A federal grand jury in North Carolina charged him with illegal weapons possession. The court documents make no mention of the ISIS connection, but U.S. officials said his Twitter postings support the terrorist group. Federal authorities accuse him of funding ISIS, trying to send jihadists to Syria to fight with the terrorist group and plotting to do some killing himself, by gunning down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq . The 30-year-old faces three counts of trying \"to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization\" (namely, ISIS), one count of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States, two counts of having an unregistered firearm silencer and one for possessing guns or silencers \"in furtherance of a crime of violence,\" court documents say. The federal investigation into Elfgeeh began in early 2013, but he wasn't arrested until May 2014. Some 100 other Americans are believed to have either fought in Syria since 2011 or been arrested before they could get there, according to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. So far, no U.S. citizen involved in fighting or supporting ISIS or any other militant group has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the United States, but that's the fear. Also, in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 -- such as the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013 or Maj. Nidal Hasan's massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 -- did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas. Former jihadist Mubin Shaikh said many of those who are attracted to ISIS or other militant causes are struggling to combine their Muslim and Western identities. \"When you're dealing with first-, second-, even third-generation individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, there are still problems of acculturation and integration,\" he said.  They ask:  \"Who am I supposed to be? \" That's the challenge mosques and Western governments will have to deal with, Shaikh said.",

        "article": "Almost a year after a blaze gutted the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building, the architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the library have been announced. Page\\Park Architects have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month - and the design team will now begin working on a detailed plan for the restoration of the  library. And these stark pictures show the mammoth task they face to restore the much-loved building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to its former glory. The Glasgow-based architects were chosen thanks to their extensive track record in both restoring and reinvigorating major historic buildings - as well their work on buildings designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Work is expected to begin in the spring of next year and it is hoped that students will have access to a fully-restored building from 2017 or 2018. Scroll down for video . The architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building have been announced . The century-old library at the Glasgow School of Art designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh was gutted in May last year . Glasgow-based Page\\Park Architects have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said the firm was chosen because of its work on Mackintosh-designed buildings . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said: 'This is the beginning of an exciting journey of discovery. There will be many fascinating questions to be addressed as we undertake this complex restoration project. 'The team assembled by Page\\Park Architects impressed us not only with their deep knowledge of the building, but of the wider work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. 'They also bring an understanding of the building's particular importance to Glasgow \u2013 its people and history - as well as of its status as an international design icon.' He added the firm has ongoing relationships with key crafts specialists and artists in Scotland and wider afield, and 'presented exciting proposals for expanding the legacy of the restoration by working with a new generation of creative talent'. Prof Toms added: 'We are looking forward to working in partnership with Page\\Park Architects and the design team to explore how we can best meet the needs of the GSA in the 21st century whilst remaining true to Mackintosh's astonishing vision.' The blaze began on May 23 last year after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight . The fire started in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show . Firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder to forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections . Thousands of damaged pieces of building material have been marked in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before . David Page, Head of Architecture at Page\\Park Architects, said: 'Page\\Park Architects are delighted to have won the commission to lead a team to restore the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh Glasgow School of Art. 'We have, over many years, had the privilege to work on and in the context of the Mackintosh legacy, the highlight of which will now be the opportunity to bring The Glasgow School of Art into splendid re-use for its students and staff, the people of Glasgow and the huge audience beyond the city.' The company has worked across the spectrum of Mackintosh's designs from the domestic, including the School of Art itself and the former Glasgow Herald offices, which is now The Lighthouse. The Mackintosh Building was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam, which a student was using for an art project, drifted into a projector fan and caught alight. The building caught fire on May 23, starting in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show. Blackened stones from the library's walls have been numbered with chalk. The building is considered by critics as Mackintosh's finest work . Firefighters were able to save\u00a0irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found . A student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam, which formed three 'walls' framing a fourth blank wall, onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place. As the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room, they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board. The fire engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the iconic building's west wing. Witnesses described firefighters in breathing apparatus standing shoulder to shoulder, forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school in a bid to prevent the blaze from spreading. Other firefighters then darted in and out of the building to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found. Despite being insured for \u00a350million, art school chiefs will receive much less because the east wing was almost completely untouched . The art school is continuing its efforts to raise \u00a320million to pay for the restoration of the building and its fire-damaged contents . No one was injured in the fire, but there was extensive damage to the Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England . No one was injured in the fire, but there was extensive damage to the Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England, which was described by critics as\u00a0Glasgow-born architect Mackintosh's greatest work. Thousands of damaged pieces of building material, including blackened stones from the library walls, have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back exactly where they were before. After a six-month investigation, the incident was described as a tragic accident by the art school's leaders. Despite being insured for \u00a350million, art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire. However, they have already received \u00a35million from the Treasury in Whitehall, \u00a31million from fundraisers and another \u00a31million in match funding from the Scottish Government. And the school is continuing its efforts to raise \u00a320million to pay for the restoration of the building and its fire-damaged contents.

        "article": "Families are to foot the bill for Sky\u2019s decision to pay \u00a34.2billion for Premier League football rights after the firm sneaked out an inflation-busting price rise on Budget Day. The firm is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or \u00a33 a month to \u00a336, or \u00a3432 a year. The bundle does not even include its sports channels, which means those who have no interest in football are subsidising Sky\u2019s deal to show Premier League games. Scroll down for video . Sky is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or \u00a33 a month, just weeks after it paid \u00a34.2billion for the rights to screen 126 live Premier League football games a season from 2016 to 2019 . Sky paid \u00a34.2billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the Premier League . Sky is also putting up the price of its Sports Bundle, which includes a basic range of channels plus seven dedicated to sport, by \u00a31 a month to \u00a347 - \u00a3564 a year. Film fans will also be hit with a 50p a month increase in the cost of the Sky Movies package and some \u00a31.50 a month more for the combination of movies and sport. Critics say the price rises appear to be an attempt to recoup the huge sum that will be paid to super rich clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City. Sky paid \u00a34.2 billion to show 126 live English Premier League matches a season from 2016 to 2019. That equates to \u00a311m per game, which is up by 66per cent compared to the current TV deal. Analysts suggested the TV giant overpaid for the football rights in order to fend off competition from BT and others, however it is clear that the pain is now being passed to viewers, whether they like sport or not. When the deal was announced, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, heralded it as a success story for the nation\u2019s biggest and richest clubs. However, it is viewers who will be funding the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and \u00a3200,000 a week contracts of the likes of Wayne Rooney, Yaya Toure, Eden Hazard, and Falcao. The company, which has more than 11m customers in the UK, bid about \u00a3300m a year more than analysts had expected in February\u2019s auction. At the time Jeremy Darroch, Sky\u2019s chief executive, said the bill would largely be financed by cost cuts, however, he hinted that price rises would be necessary. Sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record Premier League TV deal . This graphic charts the significant rise of domestic Premier League TV revenue from 1992 until 2019 . The timing of the announcement appears designed to limit media coverage. Details appeared on the firm\u2019s website on Wednesday, when the nation\u2019s attention was focused on George Osborne\u2019s Budget. Attempts to reach Sky spokesmen were frustrated by the fact most were at the London premiere of the new season of TV fantasy drama, Game of Thrones. Normally, Sky would announce any price rise in September, however making the announcement then would have coincided with its loss of the TV rights for the Champions League to BT. It would have been obvious to viewers that they were being asked to pay more for less. The inflation-busting increases will come into effect on June 1 and coincide with the middle of the latest series of Game of Thrones. Fans will effectively have to agree to the higher subscription. Sky last increased prices in September with the figure for its Sports Bundle going up by six per cent. That meant the price of its Sports package had risen about 30 per cent above inflation since 2001. The fact it is putting up prices yet again could well drive millions of people to switch to the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime, both of which cost less than \u00a37 a month. Viewer reaction to the news was hostile. One contributor to the Engadget website wrote: \u2018Hey Sky, I don\u2019t care if you overpaid Premier League, I\u2019m not paying for something I didn\u2019t buy.\u2019 Critics claim the price rises mean viewers will be funding the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and \u00a3200,000 a week contracts of the likes of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney (left) and Man City's Yaya Toure (right) Eden Hazard (left) and Manchester U's Falcao (right) are among the other highest paid Premiership players . Another, wrote: \u2018If only Game of Thrones was available elsewhere I could cancel.... Surely the sports option itself should pay for the bid?\u2019 A third questioned the rises for the non-sport packages. He wrote: \u2018So wait, they\u2019re increasing their prices to cover Premier League costs, yet the sports package is the one that\u2019s increasing least? Way to show your audience who\u2019s important!\u2019 Another said: \u2018I think it\u2019s time I dump my Sky subscription. There is now so much competition in the market I can get the same content elsewhere.\u2019 Virgin Media has complained to the TV regulator Ofcom about the way Premier League rights are sold to broadcasters, claiming it leads to expensive subscriptions which do not even provide live coverage of every game. Spokesman, Brigitte Trafford, said: \u2018Too many people feel they now have to choose between basic essentials and watching the game they love. If action is not taken to change the way the Premier League sells TV rights, the rapidly rising cost of watching football at home will see even more people priced out of the national sport.\u2019 Sky offered a bizarre explanation for the timing of the announcement, claiming it was necessary to comply with regulations imposed by the Advertising Standards Authority. In fact, the ASA has absolutely no role in the timing of such announcements. A spokesman said: \u2018We work hard to make Sky the best value entertainment choice for subscribers. On average, bills will rise by less than \u00a33 per month.\u2019",

        "article": "Believed to be the inspiration behind the world's most famous MI6 agent James Bond, Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees can rest easily after the future of the Scottish island he used to own appears to have been secured. A remote Scottish community have voted overwhelmingly to buy the island once owned by the laird. On Thursday night the result of a postal ballot was revealed on Gear Bernera in the Western Isles - home to around 250 people and linked to the Isle of Lewis by bridge. In total 85 per cent of the community turned voted with 142 saying yes to buying the island and just 37 against the move. Although the future of the island appears to have been secured, the croft house where Count Robin, the original 'James Bond' lived is still for sale . Great Bernera (right) and Little Bernera (left) from the sky; a remote Scottish community have voted overwhelmingly to buy a Hebridean island once owned by a laird said to have been the inspiration for James Bond . Great Bernera was owned for 50 years by Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, a descendant of King Louis Philippe I of France and godson of the 11th Duke of Argyll. A good friend of Bond author Ian Fleming, Count Robin is said to have been the inspiration for 007. 'It was a very big turnout,' said Tom Macdonald, Chairman of the Great Bernera Community Development Trust. 'It was great. There were about 100 people at the count.' He said the committee will now start the process of applying for funds to make the purchase. 'Hope to have it before the year is out,' said Mr Macdonald.

Daniel Craig playing the role of James Bond in Casino Royal. The character's fondness for attractive women has been linked back to\u00a0Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees who lived on the island of\u00a0Great Bernera . 'We're getting a valuation done at the moment. In 2010, the last valuation, it was valued at \u00a370,000, but we don't have an accurate up to date quote.' He continued: 'We had 16 and 17 year-olds voting. We consider it their legacy. It's very historical - an amazing result to have.' Asked if Count Robin would have been pleased with the result he said: 'I think so. The family have said in the original letter to us offering first refusal that it would have been his wish. 'I very much hope it is.' Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, who was the owner of\u00a0Great Bernera Island, would be 'pleased' with the vote, according to the locals . More than 100 people gathered in Great Bernera to hear the results of the vote . Council officials on Thursday night counting the votes; a result that saw the villagers agree to pit together and buy their island . Count Robin was known for wooing beautiful women. The Oxford graduate, who spoke several languages, worked on 'Her Majesty's Secret Service' with Fleming. In the book 007's cover as Sir Hilary Bray was based on Count Robin's then position as a heraldic researcher at the College of Arms in London. Count Robin was linked to several beautiful women including Fiona Campbell-Walker, a top model who married Baron Thyssen, one of the richest men in Europe. In 1962 he bought and moved to the ruggedly beautiful island of Great Bernera. He lived in a modest croft house on the island - which is still for sale - and was well liked by local islanders. Villages at Great Bernera have agreed to try and finance a move to own the island where the brainchild of Sir Ian Fleming's James Bond was believed to have been born . In 1962 Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees\u00a0bought and moved to the ruggedly beautiful island of Great Bernera . Count Robin remained in the Western Isles - living out his last days in a Blar Buidhe nursing home in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. He also owned ruined Inchdrewer Castle in Aberdeenshire which was reported to have been bought in by Russian princess and former Versace model Olga Roh for \u00a3400,000 in 2013. Still to be disposed of from the count's estate are a \u00a3600,000 villa at Le Touquet in France and a Sicilian property and vineyard - as well as Great Bernera. Despite his vast property empire, the count, who lived in a run-down croft house on Bernera, died with less than \u00a36000 in the bank - including \u00a375 in premium bonds. But after his death legal papers put the count's wealth at \u00a31,301,478 - mainly property.",

        "article": "An Illinois man who spent nearly two decades in prison for a 1992 rape and murder of a girl, 11, he did not commit has received a $20million settlement. Juan Rivera, 42, was awarded the money in the highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in U.S. history, his attorneys said on Friday at press conference in Chicago. Rivera was tried three times, the first time when he was 19 years old, and was finally cleared in 2012 when his 2009 conviction was reversed for the rape and murder of Holly Staker of Waukegan. Attorney Jon Loevy said there has never been a wrongful conviction case where the defendants agreed without a trial to pay compensation in such a large amount, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . An Illinois man who spent nearly two decades in prison for a 1992 rape and murder of a girl, 11, he did not commit has received a $20million settlement (above Juan Rivera, center, stands with attorneys\u00a0Jon Loevy, left, and Locke Bowman, during a news conference Friday, March 20, 2015, in Chicago) Juan Rivera (left), 42, was awarded the money in the highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in U.S. history, his attorneys said on Friday . One of the critical factors in his successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved the semend found in Staker's body did not belong to him, according to the Chicago Tribune. Rivera was coerced into a false confession and his conviction was not an accident or a mistake, said his attorney Locke Bowman. 'This was a deliberate frame-up,' said Bowman. 'This is a terrible travesty.' Prosecutors claimed that Rivera had worn a pair of shoes stained with the girls' blood, according to his attorneys. Rivera was tried three times, the first time when he was 19 years old, and was finally cleared in 2012 when his 2009 conviction was reversed for the rape and murder of Holly Staker of Waukegan (above, Rivera hugging his family after being awarded $20million) Rivera, who now works at a medical research facility at Northwestern, said he was not angry, but 'hurt, resentful, disappointed and upset' for what he had to go through in prison . Rivera was coerced into a false confession and his conviction was not an accident or a mistake, said his attorney Locke Bowman (left). As he looks forward to a new future, Rivera (right) plans to go to college and study business management and accounting, and help pay for his mother's medical bills . However, it was later revealed that the shoes were not available for purchase at the time of the murder, and his lawyers said police had tampered with them. It was also discovered that a knife found near the steps of the crime was destroyed by Waukegan police. Rivera was released from prison on January 6, 2012, a day he has declared as his new birthday, according to NBC. One of the critical factors in Rivera's successful appeal was the 2005 DNA testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in Staker's body (above Holly Staker, 11, who was raped and murdered in 1992) Last year, cops linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000. Failure to identify and arrest Staker\u2019s real killer allowed the real killer commit a second murder, according to Rivera's lawyers. 'While Mr. Rivera fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison, the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime,' said Steven Art, one of Rivera\u2019s attorneys. The law enforcement officers who were sued in the federal case are being dismissed as defendants, and will not have to pay damages, according to the Chicago Tribune. Rivera, who now works at a medical research facility at Northwestern,\u00a0said he was not angry, but 'hurt, resentful, disappointed and upset' for what he had to go through in prison. He also said that while $20million is great, he would have preferred 20 years spent with his family. Rivera said: 'To say that $20 million is a wonderful thing, of course I can live more comfortably now, my family can, I can go to college and get my education the way I've always wanted, but I still would prefer my 20 years with my family.' As he looks forward to the future, Rivera plans to go to college, study business management and accounting, and help pay for his mother's medical bills. He thanked his attorneys, and noted that other unjustly accused people are still incarcerated in Illinois and around the world. Rivera was released from prison on January 6, 2012, a day he has declared as his new birthday (above Rivera is greeted after exiting Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois on January 2012 after spending 20 years in prison) Rivera said: 'I just want to say thank you and live life with my family as best as we can and look forward to a beautiful future.' Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown. Authorities have entered the genetic profile into DNA databanks but have not obtained a match with a known suspect. Last year, cops linked DNA from the semen found in Staker with DNA obtained from a two-by-four used to brutally beat a man, Delwin Foxworth, eight years later in 2000.\u00a0Despite the DNA matches, the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown (above a map of where Staker and Foxworths' murders took place)",

        "article": "(CNN)Last month, my husband and I took our daughters to a Columbia University women's basketball game. We live nearby, had already attended a men's game and were excited for our girls, one of whom plays basketball, to watch college women in action. When we walked into the arena, my mouth practically dropped to the floor. Only a handful of people were there, quite a contrast from the nearly packed house for the men's team. It must be winter break, I thought. It wasn't. Sure, the Columbia women's team hasn't had a great season for years -- and this year wasn't much different. Still, only a handful of spectators to cheer on women who were clearly standouts in their high schools to make it to a college basketball team? I sat on the bench, cheered the women and fumed. How to Super Bowl #LikeAGirl . A few weeks later, the Princeton women's basketball team did something no other Ivy League men's team had done before, racking up 30 wins and zero losses during the regular season and beating the Ivy League season record of 28-0 held by the 1970-71 Penn men's team. (Princeton ended up losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament, finishing with a 31-1 record.) The Princeton team garnered national headlines, which was great, but I still wondered what it was going to take for women's sports to get the same attention as men's sports -- meaning an equal number of fans, TV rights, marketing endorsements, you name it. Is such a day even possible? Consider salaries alone. The average salary for a WNBA player is $72,000, which doesn't include bonuses and benefits, while the average salary for an NBA player is around $5 million, or about 70 times what the average female basketball player makes. And look at the differences in coverage. The Final Four teams for the men's NCAA basketball tournament got front page attention in Monday's New York Times. The women? A story without a photo deep in the sports section. I met Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, during a spectacular and inspirational women's conference in Jacksonville, Florida, last week called Generation W, where I moderated panels on issues affecting women. \"This connection with sports and masculinity is a very tough nut to crack. People have been trying to crack it for a long time,\" said Hogshead-Makar, who has devoted her career to the advancement of girls and women in sports. Why has coverage of women's sports stopped post-Olympics? More than 40 years after the enactment of Title IX, a law that says that any school receiving federal funds cannot discriminate based on sex, there are still huge disparities, she said, with men getting $190 million more per year in college athletic scholarships than women. \"It's appalling what these huge differences are. Any fifth-grader can walk into your average high school or college softball baseball facility and say, 'Duh, that's not equal.' \" Hogshead-Makar, who is chief executive officer of the advocacy group Champion Women, said even though Title IX requires that women get the same access to media and support that men get, it's not happening. \"The coupling of sexism and sport, having this be an exclusionary practice, is still a strong one,\" said the 1984 Olympic champion. Attitudes about women and sports still have a long way to go before we get to true gender equality, based on a recent poll by Always, the brand that brought us the viral #LikeAGirl video sensation. While a majority of the 1,800 men and women polled said both genders were equal in math and science, they said sports was the one area where they believe there are differences. A significant percentage of both women and men said men are better at sports, with 32% of women feeling that way and 47% of men, the poll found. Hilary Knight, a member of the U.S. Olympic hockey team, called the findings \"disappointing\" but said women's sports is still young, with Title IX only a few decades old. \"It's just a gradual growth process that we kind of have to see through,\" said Knight, who appears in the most recent #LikeAGirl video, this one released for International Women's Day this month, showcasing women proudly talking about how they shoot, score and do chemistry like a girl. Knight admits the changes in women's sports might not come during her hockey career but says she believes they will eventually come, especially as more women play the game. When she started playing hockey 15 years ago, there were few girls who did. Today, you walk into a local rink and you'll find girls' and boys' teams, she said. \"It's a slow process, but as long as you are changing the stereotype, and you are really empowering women and girls to feel proud of who they are and not hindering their progress in any way, I think we are going to see sport get to where it needs to be.\" Michele Yulo, whose 9-year-old daughter, Gabi, plays basketball and baseball on boys' teams, also thinks it will take time to create the opportunities for women, which will help change the mindset about women and sports. Her main focus, she says, is on making sure girls like her daughter can play the sports they love. In June, her daughter will play in an all-girls baseball tournament in Orlando organized by a program called Baseball for All, which was founded to ensure that girls can play baseball when they are young and continue playing the game when they are older. \"What I think is gaining traction is an awareness of female athletes in general and recognition of their strength, skill and determination -- and that yes, this has some effect on the popularity and growth of women's sports programs,\" said Yulo, creator of the blog Princess Free Zone. \"There seems to be a greater push for girls and women to be taken seriously in sports.\" Girls' and women's sports are growing in popularity as participation increases, said Deborah Slaner Larkin, chief executive officer of the Women's Sports Foundation. Slaner Larkin points to U.S. women's soccer star Alex Morgan, for example, who has over 1.5 million followers on Twitter, and how the upcoming Women's World Cup in Canada is a trending topic worldwide. That said, girls have more than 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play sports than boys do in high school and about 63,000 fewer participation slots at the college level, according to Slaner Larkin. \"Once sports are recognized as a birthright for both genders, the rest will fall into place,\" she said. Helping get us there, she said, is a new generation of moms who played sports as a result of Title IX, which became law in 1972. \"These women identify as athletes and women's sports fans, and they will now pass down their experiences to their daughters,\" she said. Getting women into the stands is key to winning television coverage and the big salaries that come with that exposure, said Michael Graber, a sports cinematographer and father of two girls. \"In sports TV, the tail wags the dog. The money goes where the audience is,\" said Graber, who is the husband of  Diana Graber, the co-founder of the digital literacy site CyberWise.org. \"Money will go to women's sports as soon as an audience wants to watch women, so the best way to support women athletes is by attending women's sports in the first place.\" John Furjanic of Chicago said he and a friend took their young daughters to a DePaul University women's basketball game for Valentine's Day for the third year in a row. \"In my humble opinion, any father who doesn't take their young daughters to watch women's sports (at all levels -- grammar school through pro) is missing a chance to expose their children to the opportunities that await them,\" said Furjanic, whose daughter is 7. \"Long-term, parents taking kids to women's games and women's teams promoting themselves in schools has to be helpful to establishing widespread popularity, generations at a time.\" Getting more people into the stands and seeing more girls play more sports will bring about change, many women say. So too will seeing new leaders emerge who believe in gender equality in all areas, including sports. \"Sports are a microcosm of life,\" said Slaner Larkin. \"As we begin to see a more diverse group of men and women in leadership and decision-making roles throughout the industry, we should also see significant changes in media, sponsorship and other fundamental areas of support.\" Hogshead-Makar, the former Olympic champion, told me about a case she recently learned about involving dramatically unequal facilities for the women's softball and men's baseball teams at a public high school in Indiana. \"It tells the baseball players you're more important,\" she said. \"That's equally as unhealthy, as for a girl to hear that she's not as important as for him to hear that he's more important.\" \"When the leadership says, 'We're going to make this just as important,' \" change will come, she said.

        "article": "Kelly Jane Richards has been told she could face prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy . A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy. Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child. Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her. Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support. The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday. The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard. A second similar charge was left to 'lie\u00a0on file'. Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'. Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you. 'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass. 'This is a serious matter. 'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.' She was shielded going out of the court by her husband. Richards will be sentenced on March 23. Richards was pictured with a hood covering her head arriving at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court this morning . The married mother of two was said to break down in tears after she appeared at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court .",

        "article": "Super midwife Kathleen McSherry has retired after delivering a record 7,000 babies. Colleagues believe Kathleen, 66, from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has notched up more births than any other British midwife in a career spanning six decades. She said: 'It's been a labour of love. Every delivery has been a very special moment for me. Bringing a new life into the world is the best job in the world.' Kathleen McSherry from\u00a0Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has delivered more than 7,000 babies since 1966 . Kathleen with one of her many deliveries, left, and hard at work for\u00a0Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS . She continued: 'The sheer joy of being at a family's happiest moment is truly wonderful. I'll miss it so much.' Kathleen, who is a fan of the hit TV show Call the Midwife, has spent her career in the bustling maternity wards of three busy Glasgow hospitals - Stobhill, The Queen Mother's and the Southern General. The father of a child she delivered worked out she must have delivered more than 7,000 babies - based on the fact she's delivered three babies per shift on average. Fellow midwives agree they are unaware of anyone who has helped deliver so many babies. Kathleen's daughter Ashley, who set up a Facebook page in her honour, said: 'She has enjoyed every one of her days working to deliver babies and we are all very proud of her service to the NHS. I think she will miss it so much now she's retired.' The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-five has enjoyed a career which mirrors her favourite TV programme, Call The Midwife. Kathleen, second from right, has been delivering babies at three Glasgow hospitals for six decades . Kathleen started training in the 60s and her career mirrors that of her favourite TV programme Call the Midwife . She began her training in 1966 aged just 17, after working as a sales assistant in the former Glen's department store in Glasgow. During her career there has never been a dull moment. She has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her. 'It's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love,' Kathleen said. She's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she's brought into the world. 'You can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time,' she said. 'They set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it's time to be born.' The most magical moment in Kathleen's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren . She also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband Jim, 67, a retired firefighter, what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child Katey. 'It was five in the morning when I woke up in labour and Jim ushered our older kids, Pauline, then nine, Paul, seven, and Ashley two, into the kitchen with breakfast cereal and told them to stay there,' she remembers. 'I knew this baby wasn't waiting, so we called an ambulance hoping I would make it to the Queen Mother's Hospital about four miles away. 'It was a blizzard outside and I hoped it would arrive in time. 'The midwife flying squad was also called - but our wee girl arrived before they got here - and Jim had to do the honours. 'I was at one end issuing instructions to Jim, hoping all was going well down at his end. 'Being a midwife helped, as did having three babies previously!' The most magical moment of her career was being at the delivery of two grandchildren. Her daughters Pauline, now 44, and Ashley, 35, wanted their mum by their sides as they gave birth. 'Pauline had a wee boy, Dale, in 1994, and it was magic supporting her throughout the labour,' Kathleen remembers. 'I was thrilled being allowed to assist my second daughter, Ashley's wee boy, Matthew, into the world in 2009. The saddest moments in Kathleen's career has been when couples have lost babies after years of trying . 'I put my hands on her baby when he came out and broke the news to my daughters both times that they'd had boys. 'You worry so much more when your daughter is pregnant and in labour. That's mainly because you know what mums have to endure. 'People say it's just childbirth but they don't call it labour for nothing.. It's exhausting and takes women to the limit of endurance.' But being a midwife has brought heartache too. 'The saddest have been couples who lost babies after years of trying,' she adds. 'Your heart goes out to them. It is the hardest challenge for any midwife.' It's been a family career for Kathleen as her mum, Mary, was a nurse during the Second World War and her sister Moira, 68, took the same path. 'I grew up with mum being a nurse and she worked through some really hard times during the War. 'She never complained once about the long hours on old Nightingale wards. 'In fact, she was a great role model for us.' None of Kathleen's children have followed her into midwifery, though. 'There are so many other career options open to women,' she says. Daughter Katey, 33, an ASDA section leader, said: 'It's very impressive how long she's been a midwife. 'She is one of the longest serving in Scotland.' Kathleen's bosses, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are sad to see her leave. Evelyn Frame, Head of Midwifery at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: 'Kathleen has dedicated her life to delivering babies and supporting new mums and we wish her all the very best on her retirement.'",

In a post she wrote on The Free Thought Project's site, Ms Fairbanks explained that she and a few other women were 'concerned the photo spreading further could cause embarrassment for Sean'. 'Kind-hearted gesture': Although the group were concerned of embarrassing Sean by tweeting the photos, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for the Dancing Man outweighed the risks . Supporting Sean: Emma Roid tweeted to Sean: 'If you see this, we want you to know that we've got your back' More support: Another user, with the handle @tinypants', said she hoped someone on Twitter could identify Sean - before his name was revealed. 'Half the Internet wants to give him a hug,' she wrote, using the hashtag . Fellow dancing enthusiast: Charlie Heapy added: 'We need to #FindDancingMan and have a big dancing party!' But eventually, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for Sean - 'bringing some positivity to such an upsetting situation' - outweighed the risks, she wrote. In the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next Arsenal football team's emblem. And just hours later, the Dancing Man himself set up a Twitter account to reply to Ms Fairbanks - and posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading: 'Hi Cass & Twitter (as requested!).' After confirming Sean's identity and discovering he lives in London, Ms Fairbanks posted: 'YAY TWITTER!!! @Dancingmanfound #FindDancingMan. We are going to dance!!!' 'Lucky': In the early hours of Friday, CassCams Models noted that Sean would soon be a very 'lucky bloke' It's him! At around the same time, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next Arsenal football team's emblem in London (pictured) Crying with happiness: A user named Kendall reacted positively to the news that the man had been identified . Emotional: Katherine Bayley said the Dancing Man story had 'made me cry', adding: 'People are so nasty' Social media users responded in a similar fashion. Twitter user Naomi Foster wrote: 'The dancing man story has made my day couldn't stop crying at that picture. glad it's a happy ending for him.' Nick Lavallee, a comedian from Manchester, New Hampshire, tweeted: '@Dancingmanfound @CassandraRules this is the best thing I've read in awhile. Have fun dancing with the hot babes!' And a user named Jessica said: 'Sooooo happy the dancing man has been found.' On Friday, a GoFundMe\u00a0page\u00a0was set up by the 1,727 women, who are all part of the Coconut Oil Friendship Club, to raise money to fly Sean to Los Angeles for 'a dance party of a lifetime'. 'Not stopped smiling or laughing': The Dancing Man himself set up a Twitter account to reply to Ms Fairbanks . Raising money by the minute: On Friday, a GoFundMe page was set up by the 1,727 women, who are all part of the Coconut Oil Friendship Club, to raise money to fly Sean to Los Angeles for 'a dance party of a lifetime' As of 2pm on Friday, it had raised a staggering $3,906 - with donations as high as $150 coming in by the minute. Any additional donations will be given to an anti-bullying campaign. And what does Sean have to say about the all-women VIP dance party? Well, he told Ms Fairbanks that he is currently in Kiev for two weeks - but  is free when he returns, according to Buzzfeed. '[He] is always ready for an adventure,' Ms Fairbanks said.",

        "article": "Rome (CNN)Italy's highest court Friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of American Amanda Knox, according to Judge Gennaro Marasca. The high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, or send the case back for another appeal, or potentially on to a different section of the court. Knox, a 27-year-old Seattle native, and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of Knox's British roommate, Meredith Kercher. Knox and Kercher lived together in Italy at the time of Kercher's death. Sollecito and Knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal, and then Knox returned to the United States. However, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the acquittals in 2013, and they were convicted last year after a retrial. If a new trial is ordered, Knox and Sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached. But if the court upholds the conviction, the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to Knox next is uncertain. Conventional wisdom dictates that Knox will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the Italian Justice Ministry to serve her 28-year sentence, but that could take years. The statute of limitations is double the sentence, meaning the Italians have 57 years to bring her back to the country. Knox, however, would benefit from the United States' extradition treaty with Italy -- under which the United States will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the U.S. Constitution's protection against double jeopardy. Sollecito, on the other hand, still lives in Italy, and has a lot more to lose than Knox does, at least in the short term. He would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25-year sentence. All of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail. Sollecito earlier said he would be in court on Wednesday to face the judge. \"I've been living this for eight years,\" he told the Italian crime TV program \"Quarto Grado.\" Not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway.\" Rudy Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was convicted separately in a fast-track trial and is midway through a 16-year sentence for Kercher's murder. His case was confirmed by Italy's high court in 2010. Many commentators in the U.S. have reasoned that Italy may not ask the United States for Knox's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations. But there could be a greater rift if it appears that Knox gets away with murder and her Italian ex-boyfriend pays for the crime. If Sollecito is languishing in prison and Knox is sipping Frappuccino in a Seattle Starbucks, Italians will not be pleased, says Alessandro Capponi, an Italian journalist for Corriere Della Sera who has been covering the case since Kercher was killed in 2007. \"It will be seen as an injustice,\" Capponi told CNN. \"You may not see people out on the streets, but if you ask 10 people what they think, those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the Italian and the African are in prison. The Italians will say that the American gets away with murder and it won't be the first time.\" This is not the first time Italy and the United States have butted heads on matters involving American suspects accused of crimes in Italy. In 1998, an American Marine aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the Dolomites, sending 20 people plummeting to their death. Even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight, only two of the four Marines were charged and convicted. Only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six-month sentence. In 2012, Italy's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 Americans (22 CIA agents and an Air Force pilot) for the kidnapping of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar, a suspeced terrorist, from a street in Milan. They were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison, but Italy has not yet asked for extradition. \"Our relationship with the United States is full of these diplomatic tensions,\" said Capponi. \"This will just be added to the list.\" Knox's case has been divisive from the start, and her supporters have come down hard on the Italian judicial system. Sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude, knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not, so vocally criticizing it wouldn't be in his best interest. In fact, he has long suffered the impact of Knox's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized Italy from the other side of the Atlantic. By almost any Italian precedent, Sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because Knox was deemed a flight risk, she had to stay in jail. Because Sollecito was her co-defendant, he did too, even though he had no ties to anyone abroad. \"Knox could still beat the system, but Sollecito's game is up if the convictions are upheld,\" Nicola Canestrini, an Italian extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems, told CNN. \"He has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them, which will likely cause deep resentment here in Italy.\" Perhaps a little too late, Sollecito's defense team has been slowly inching away from Knox, especially since the latest conviction. Last summer, he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court, in which his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno pointed out \"certain anomalies\" in Knox's testimony that have nothing to do with Sollecito. \"We ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of Amanda's testimony to Raffaele,\" Bongiorno said at the time. Whether that is enough to get the high court to give Sollecito another, independent chance is yet to be seen. \"I am not a crazy person. I am not a criminal. I am innocent,\" Sollecito told reporters last summer at the press conference. \"But my name is Raffaele Sollecito, not Amanda Marie Knox.\" Now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Her arm thrust out and pouting like a rapper, this is the moment that Michelle Obama showed off her dance moves during a toe-curling appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Challenged to show off her dance moves by Ms Degeneres, Mrs Obama gamely obliged and went on to pull shapes that wouldn't have shamed Rita Ora. Unfortunately for daughters Sasha and Malia, the appearance on Ellen, which airs on the 16th March, isn't the end of the 51-year-old's dancing ambitions. Toe-curling: Michelle Obama does her best Rita Ora during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Mrs Obama was appearing on the show to mark the fifth anniversary of her 'Let's Move!' initiative, which aims to encourage people to get out and do some exercise. As part of the campaign, the US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to Uptown Funk on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Although egg hunts are no longer part of the event, children are still invited for egg rolling on the lawn and a slap-up afternoon tea. Practising: According to Mrs Obama, she has been practising the dance routine for more than a year . All smiles: Ms DeGeneres, who says her style is 'street', also joined in with the dance routine . Repeating the trick: Mrs Obama will pull her dancing shoes on again during the annual Easter Egg Roll . 3.1 Phillip Lim cropped high waisted wide leg trouser pants at Saks Fifth Avenue . Shop the trousers at Saks . Visit site . America's fashionable first lady looks just as much at ease wearing ball gowns or a pair of pants and comfortable sneakers. At a recent appearance at the Ellen show,  Michelle Obama paired a 3.1 Phillip Lim white wide leg pants with a black top and cropped jacket. Her outfit choice is obviously comfort driven, as she went on to show off her dance moves dancing to the catchy Uptown Funk song. Along with the trendy monochrome color palette, the always stylish Mrs Obama also embraced the white hot trend of wide leg pants. After many years of skinny pant dominance, the roomy silhouette is once again back in fashion. Just in time for the warmer weather, wear them with sneakers like Mrs O or go glam and  pair them with high heels. Either way, these pants will turn heads on the streets.

Luckily for the teenagers, Mrs Obama revealed during her chat with Ms DeGeneres that she has been practising for the moment for more than a year, hopefully minimising the potential for embarrassment. Not that the Obamas will be too worried if they are, with President Obama previously telling the Press that should his daughters think of getting a tattoo, he will insist on getting one too. Most recently, the girls couldn't hide their embarrassment during a Thanksgiving event, the pardoning of the turkey, in which Obama 'pardoned' two turkeys named Mac and Cheese. Embarrassing: The Obamas' daughters have had numerous toe-curling moments at their parents' hands . Displeased: Most recently, they looked nonplussed as their father cracked jokes during a White House dinner . Embarrassing dad: President Obama has previously admitted to dancing to Gangnam Style around the house . The press corps laughed along but both Malia and Sasha appeared disinterested as Obama joked: 'Let's face it, if you're a turkey and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low!' Like his wife, the US President has also deployed dance as a means of winding up his daughters, having once told People magazine of his penchant for performing to Gangnam Style. 'They're cooler than I am,' he added. 'There are things I like that they think are cheesy, like Gangnam Style. I love that.'",

        "article": "Driving ban: Alison Baker, 60, was allowed by a judge to attend the classes she used to run . A motorist who ran drink-drive awareness classes has been banned from the road after being caught three times over the limit. But Alison Baker, of Pinhoe, Devon, was allowed by a judge to attend the course she used to run - which would see her ban reduced by a quarter if completed. The 60-year-old had twice driven to her local petrol station to buy bottles of wine within a couple of hours of one morning last May. But the garage cashier was concerned she was not in a fit state to drive on the second visit and told police, Exeter Magistrates\u2019 Court heard. Officers turned up at her home, and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up. Baker had denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial last month, before being banned from the road for two years yesterday. In an account rejected by a district judge, she blamed the high reading on post-driving consumption and said she had downed one and a half bottles of wine in about ten minutes before the police came to her home. Yesterday, Sonia Croft, prosecuting, said Baker was a trainer on drink-drive courses and should not be allowed her to attend such classes. She claimed that Baker would know all about the course and gain nothing from it. But Vanessa Francis, defending, said this claim by prosecutors was 'spiteful and unnecessarily punitive'. Sentencing: Exeter Magistrates\u2019 Court (pictured) was told that when Baker eventually answered the door she was so drunk that she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up . She said this was Baker's first drink-driving offence and it would be unfair to refuse a first-time offender the chance to go on the course. District Judge Stephen Nicholls accepted this request. He banned her from driving for 26 months - but that could fall by 26 weeks if she passes the course by August 2016. She was also given an 18-month community order and told to pay \u00a3430 in costs. Miss Francis said Baker was involved in drink-drive courses in the local area for three years - but was made redundant three years ago because of the rise in the number of privately-run providers. During her trial Baker - who ran the classes for Devon County Council - denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'. Vehicle: Baker\u00a0claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car (file) She did not contest the high reading - 104mg of alcohol in her breath when the legal limit is 35mg - but claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car. Baker admitted decanting wine from bottles so she could hide them from her husband. She said she used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and suffered problems with her knees, legs and wrist. The defendant said she drank herself into 'oblivion'  and would down alcohol until she passed out. Baker hid the empty bottles of wine - placing some of them in equipment she used for her drink drive awareness courses. She denied being over the limit, saying she only had two units of alcohol between trips, but admitted: \u2019I can't remember the police coming to the house.\u2019",

        "article": "Nigel Farage yesterday accused anti-Ukip protesters of chasing his terrified family out of a country pub \u2013 and branded them \u2018scum\u2019. He said his two daughters ran away in fear after being targeted by an 80-strong fancy dress \u2018mob\u2019 who described themselves as \u2018migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mums\u2019. The bizarre protest featured several women and men clutching dolls to their chests in an apparent reference to the Ukip leader\u2019s comments that nursing mothers should \u2018sit in the corner\u2019. Scroll down for videos . Nigel Farage has branded anti-Ukip protesters 'scum' after they stormed a pub where he was having a family lunch and 'chased his car down the road' The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place.\u00a0He claimed his two youngest children were so scared by the protesters that they ran away and hid . Mr Farage said his daughters, Victoria, 15, and ten-year-old Isabelle were missing for a short time yesterday afternoon before the police returned them to the family home. After hounding him out of the Queen\u2019s Head in Downe, Kent, protesters surrounded his car, kicking it and jumping on his bonnet as his wife, Kirsten, tried to drive him away. The Ukip leader later told the Mail: \u2018We were having a pleasant Sunday and then suddenly the mob descended. There was various screaming, shouting and intimidation. \u2018My children ran away and hid. The landlord called the police who came quickly and later brought them back to my home. They also attacked my car as my wife drove me off.\u2019 He added: \u2018I\u2019m used to this \u2013 it happens every day. But I am utterly appalled by these disgusting people for bringing my family into it. It was an unpleasant ordeal for them.These people are scum.\u2019 The protest\u2019s organisers denied Mr Farage\u2019s children were scared and ran away. Pictures posted on Twitter as Mrs Farage tried to drive off showed a woman lying on the car bonnet as others banged the roof and windows. Neighbour Sheila Jenkins, 76, said she heard \u2018chanting\u2019 outside her house and looked out of the window to see demonstrators in fancy dress. Demonstrators had previously descended on the George & Dragon, where Mr Farage has previously been pictured having a drink, before realising he was in the other pub nearby . The group was in fancy dress and included migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mothers . She said: \u2018There were lots of them and I saw a big placard saying \u201cUkip not in my backyard\u201d. There was a man dressed as an Arab, with big dark glasses and a turban, and one with a big beard in a blonde lady\u2019s wig. I don\u2019t know what they were trying to prove.\u2019 Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said he stepped out to see what the commotion was. \u2018They were singing \u201cWe are family\u201d and then I saw someone trying to stop a car getting through,\u2019 he said. \u2018Someone kicked the back of the car as it went past. I think they went a bit too far.\u2019 Photos taken in the pub showed demonstrators apparently holding a \u2018Muslim call to prayer\u2019 and organising \u2018Polish language lessons\u2019. Protester Chris Baugh, assistant general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, boasted on Twitter: \u2018I just chased Farage from his local, few others with us & very funny. Solidarity.\u2019 Customer James Beer, owner of a web design company, tweeted: \u2018Just saw Nigel Farage being hounded out of a pub I was in by fancy dressed protesters harassing him and kicking his car in. Priceless.\u2019 Staff at the Queen's Head refused to comment on the episode, while the George & Dragon said protesters had initially claimed they were there for a birthday party . The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place. He is pictured at the pub last June . But many were shocked, even those who oppose Ukip. Kevin Maguire, a left-wing columnist, tweeted: \u2018No fan of Ukip and also no fan of hounding people out of pubs, frightening kids and jumping on cars.\u2019 Dan Glass, another of the protest leaders, denied Mr Farage\u2019s children had been scared off, saying: \u2018He was sitting on his own and left on his own. We didn\u2019t see any kids.\u2019 The organisers later released a statement attributed to \u2018photographer\u2019 Mike Kear. It said: \u2018As some protesters and the press entered the rear of the pub, I saw a blonde haired woman leaving with two children. At no time were any children seen to be scared or running away. Could this be that Farage is manipulating the truth for his own ends?\u2019 Ukip is understood to have requested taxpayer-funded security for Mr Farage during the election campaign amid fears that he is regularly being targeted by protesters.",

General Raymond Odierno warned that the cuts could diminish Britain\u2019s ability to fight future campaigns. He also called on the Government to maintain defence spending at the Nato target of two per cent of national income. Scroll down for video . Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns . General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America\u2019s confidence in their military ally. I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,\u2019 he told The Daily Telegraph. \u2018We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do. \u2018What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.\u2019 His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain\u2019s Armed Forces would be \u2018unwise\u2019 with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism. Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP . In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to \u2018tackle the really wicked issues\u2019 facing the world. And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions \u2013 further undermining the UK\u2019s global standing. The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment. 'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.' His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds. 'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of GDP for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence, I think a lot of Conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating,' he told the BBC'S Andrew Neil. 'What is happening at the moment with, for example, Putin's Russia, is really only one miscalculation away from creating an Article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the European continent.' He was referring to the NATO article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28. Dr Fox added the relationship between Britain and America had been compromised following Parliament's voting against intervening in Syria following the regime's reported use of chemical weapons. 'I think there was damage done to Britain's relationship with the US at least to an extent when Parliament voted not to take action over the Syrian use of chemical weapons. During a recent visit to Washington Mr Cameron was told by President Barack Obama that reducing Britain's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty . 'I think there's a real danger here which is (that) you shouldn't make threats which you're not willing to follow through on. 'If you draw red lines, as President Obama did, and don't follow them through, that only gives comfort to your enemies.' David Cameron was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in Wales last year. However recent reports revealed the Government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent. President Obama last month insisted Britain live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening NATO. During a visit to Washington he told David Cameron that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty. Only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past. They are the US, Britain, Estonia and Greece.",

        "article": "The Archbishop of Adelaide has been charged with covering up child sex abuse. It is alleged Philip Wilson tried to hide abuse carried out by another priest in the 1970s, The Australian\u00a0reported. Wilson was appointed archbishop for the South Australian capital in 2011. Philip Wilson has been charged with covering up child sex abuse carried out by a priest in the 1970s . The charge comes after it was revealed the senior figure in the Catholic Church did not report priest Jim Fletcher who was accused of paedophilia while they were working in the Maitland region, north of Sydney in New South Wales. Fletcher ended up serving prison time from 1989 to 1991 after he was convicted of raping a 13-year-old boy. Five years later, the convicted paedophile died. A Special Commission of Inquiry conducted last year handed down that Fletcher 'had an extensive history of perpetrating child sexual abuse in the diocese, exclusively abusing young males, particularly altar boys'. Philip Wilson arrives to give evidence during the Royal Commision into child abuse at the Federal Court in Adelaide last year . It is thought Wilson is the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature (pictured above is St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican) Wilson is thought to be the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature and if sentenced, could face up to two years behind bars, News Corp reported. NSW police said a 64-year-old man was charged after allegedly concealing 'a serious offence regarding child sexual abuse' in the Hunter region. The charge is the result of an investigation by Strike Force Lantle, which since 2010 has probed allegations of concealment of child abuse by former and current clergy attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church. Police said a future court attendance notice related to the matter was served in South Australia on Tuesday. It comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse continues in Sydney. Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Sydney's Knox Grammar School, gave evidence . A former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, accused Dr Paterson of touching her on the buttocks, which he denies . The matter is listed for Newcastle Local Court on April 30. This charge comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse continues in Sydney. Explosive claims have been made during the hearing, including allegations of extensive abuse carried out at Knox Grammar School on Sydney's North Shore. Dr Ian Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, admitted to impeding a police investigation into allegations of paedophilia from teachers while he was giving evidence earlier this month. While a former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, told the inquiry about an incident where she claims Dr Paterson touched her on the buttocks during a joint rehearsal of a musical with Knox. But the former headmaster has vehemently denied the allegation, saying he 'absolutely not' touch Ms Perry in 1989 when she was 15. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who is considering a run for president, used his private account while he was in office to discuss a variety of topics. These included 'security and military issues such as troop deployments to the Middle East and the protection of nuclear plants.' Scroll down for video . Jeb Bush (above), the former governor of Florida who is considering a run for president, used his private account while he was in office to discuss a variety of topics . Bush (above with his family at Camp David in 2008) discussed 'security and military issues such as troop deployments to the Middle East and the protection of nuclear plants' The Washington Post reports that these emails also included 'two series of exchanges involving details of Florida National Guard troop deployments after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.' Bush aides told the paper that none of the emails contained classified information and that most of the information was already public knowledge. This comes just over a week after Bush publicly attacked Clinton for using her personal email while serving as Secretary of State. 'For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is, and it\u2019s a dangerous world, and security would mean that you couldn\u2019t have a private server,' said Bush in an interview with Radio Iowa. 'It\u2019s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn\u2019t come up in Secretary Clinton\u2019s thought process.' Communications director Tim Miller said of this new report; 'This Democrat opposition research dump of a few innocuous e-mails that Gov. Bush voluntarily posted on a Web site only highlights how large the gap is between him and Clinton in the area of transparency.' This news comes just one week after Bush attacked Hillary Clinton (above) for using her personal email while Secretary of State . Johannes Ullrich, a cybersecurity expert, outlines the problem however with using a personal account, which is far easier to get in to for a hacker. 'The bigger issue here is, what else can an attacker do?' he said. 'Now I may be able to penetrate a National Guard commander\u2019s laptop by infecting it or by impersonating Jeb Bush\u2019s account. . . . Now you may even be able to give the order to remove troops or change deployments.' The Democratic National\u00a0Committee\u00a0said they still have questions for Bush, with spokeswoman Holly Shulman saying; 'The GOP presidential hopefuls\u2019 attacks on this issue are completely disingenuous, and there are still a litany of questions Republicans need to answer, like what e-mails has Jeb Bush not turned over?'",

        "article": "Hillary Clinton has been hammered time and time again for the scandal which erupted after it emerged that she used her personal email account for government business. But she made light of the scandal at a gathering of reports on Monday night, looking forward to 'new beginnings'... including a new address. Clinton, who is expected to declare her bid for president in the coming weeks, even promised 'no more secrecy' after weeks of being pressed to turn over State Department emails she had hitherto kept to herself. Joker: Hillary Clinton showed her lighter side, joking with reporters about her recent email scandal, and promising 'no more secrecy'. She is pictured about at a speech earlier on Monday . The former Secretary of State and First Lady, who was speaking at the awards ceremony for a political journalism prize, admitted it was odd for her to willingly put herself in the way of the press - but tried to spin the occasion as a fresh start. She said: 'I am well aware that some of you may be a little surprised to see me here tonight. You know my relationship with the press has been at times, shall we say, complicated.' '... But I am all about new beginnings. A new grandchild, another new hairstyle, a new email account \u2013 why not a new relationship with the press? 'So here goes. No more secrecy. No more zone of privacy - after all, what good does that do me.' Prank: Clinton joked that everyone at the prize-giving in Washington, D.C., had a non-disclosure agreement under their seat . However, she couldn't help but indulge her secretive side, even in jest, by pretending the guests would all be stopped from talking about the event with a legal gagging order. She said: 'But first of all, before I go any further, if you look under your chairs, you\u2019ll find a simple non-disclosure agreement. My attorneys drew it up. Old habits... last.' She was speaking at a ceremony held for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, which is awarded by Syracuse University. The event in D.C. honors Robin Toner, a political reporter who died in 2008, but interviewed Clinton several times in the preceding decades. Dan Balz, a Washington Post reporter, won the $5,000 prize this year. The event could be one of Clinton's last public appearances before announcing her much-anticipated candidacy for president in 2016. At one point in the her remarks at the event she seemed to make a joke about her longstanding position that she is still considering whether to run or not. It came on the day that Ted Cruz became the first to throw his hat into the ring and announce himself as the first official candidate in the presidential election. Other Republicans, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.",

        "article": "The English don\u2019t actually care much for music,\u2019 said Sir Thomas Beecham, the great 20th-century conductor and noted wit, \u2018but they love the sound it makes!\u2019 This week the sound that has filled our concert halls and all the spaces where music-lovers gather has been of loud cheering. When it was announced on Tuesday that Sir Simon Rattle will be coming home from Germany in 2017 to run the London Symphony Orchestra, whoops of delight could be heard all the way from London\u2019s Barbican Centre, where the LSO play, to Menlove Avenue,Woolton, the middle-class suburb of Liverpool where Rattle was born 60 years ago. The most remarkable English classical musician since the celebrated Beecham, Rattle has scaled the highest peaks. Appointed CBE at the ripe old age of 32, he was knighted seven years later, and elected principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, the world\u2019s most formidable orchestra, at 44. Conductor Sir Simon Rattle is to join London Symphony Orchestra as music director . In an age of overpaid footballers and gruesome shows like The X Factor, an age when the mediocre wear garlands tossed by dullards, here is a man who has truly earned his laurel crown. When he received the weighty badge of the Order of Merit last summer (\u2018Don\u2019t try conducting with this thing on!\u2019 the Queen told him at the investiture) it was formal recognition that he belonged to the best of the best. Now the man who conquered the world is coming home to join our leading orchestra and, what\u2019s more, he sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can. \u2018Frankly,\u2019 he says, \u2018what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in any concert hall.\u2019 Knowing Rattle as I do, this was no throw-away remark. Talk of greatness is usually misplaced. There are never many truly great performers in any field. So when they do come along it is our duty to recognise the special gifts that lift them above the pack. We could call it the Federer distinction. Roger Federer is a great tennis player, perhaps the greatest; Andy Murray is merely very good. In the performing arts it can be difficult to describe what greatness looks like because, unlike in sport, there are no clear winners and losers. Over time, however, you have a sense of those who achieve it. Laurence Olivier, for instance, was a great actor. Rudolf Nureyev was a great dancer. Frank Sinatra was a great singer. And Sir Simon Rattle is unquestionably a great musician. Born on the same road in Liverpool as John Lennon, Rattle was at primary school when The Beatles took off like a rocket. No magical mystery tours for him, though. The Rattler, as he is known, was a bookish child, who played the piano and was later a percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra. \u2018I tried to interest him in cricket and football\u2019, said his father Denis, \u2018but he always seemed to have his head in a music score.\u2019 Sir Simon (right), whose youngest child with Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1 (left), 41, is seven months old, has directed the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002 . Denis Rattle, originally from Kent, was a businessman who taught English in his retirement. At Oxford University, where he knew Sir Edward Heath, he had played in a jazz band, so he did nothing to discourage his son\u2019s enthusiasm for music. When Denis and Pauline Rattle took their son to see the comedian Al Read at the Liverpool Empire, the five-year-old stopped the show. So many members of the audience were amused by the sight of a curious little boy leaving his seat to peer into the orchestra pit that Read had to tell him: \u2018Come on, lad. I\u2019ve got a show to do!\u2019 The young Rattle never set foot in Liverpool\u2019s football ground Anfield or Everton\u2019s Goodison Park as his father might have wished but he was a regular at the city\u2019s wonderful Philharmonic Hall where, in 1966, his life changed for ever. Gustav Mahler\u2019s mighty Second Symphony, the Resurrection, despite its challenging discords, made him realise even then, aged 11, that he wanted to be a conductor. And now he was determined to learn how. He studied music scores his sister brought home from the library; he pored over composers\u2019 writings on orchestration. He would write down the percussion parts of big orchestral pieces, gather friends and family, and hand out those parts so he could conduct his impromptu orchestra while a record of the music played in the background. When he was 15, he cajoled enough musicians together to form a proper orchestra and stage a charity event at Liverpool\u2019s College Hall. It was a resounding success. Rattle\u2019s days as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are the stuff of legend. When he went there aged 25 in 1980 he was, musically speaking, barely out of short pants and the orchestra was at best lacklustre. When he left 18 years later as a knight of the realm, the CBSO was acclaimed as one of the world\u2019s finest orchestras, and had a magnificent new home. Symphony Hall, which opened in June 1991 as a result of Rattle\u2019s persistence and enlightened cross-party political co-operation, remains the best concert hall in Britain. So when people talk about the cultural development of Birmingham, and Rattle\u2019s substantial part in it, they are not fibbing. The question is: what can he do for London and Britain? The signs are promising. There is a clear will to build a concert hall worthy of London\u2019s unrivalled reputation as a city of culture and Rattle knows, for he is no fool, that his appointment can only assist the process. In the City they are no fools either. Everybody understands that, with Rattle at the helm of such a fine orchestra, the LSO could become world-beaters not only in public performances but also in the world of music education. Rattle sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can . Rattle once described how moving it was to bring deaf children into rehearsals in Birmingham, and see how they responded through vibration alone to the experience of a Beethoven symphony. In Berlin he wasted no time in working with children from the city\u2019s less well-off backgrounds, involving them in dance collaborations with the Berlin Philharmonic. Some musicians, brought up in the old school, were sceptical but not for long. \u2018What Simon wants\u2019, musicians used to say, \u2018Simon gets\u2019. Which is why his return to London is so thrilling, and so important. In a world of show-offs and halfwits, here is a man with the faith and willpower to move mountains: not on his own behalf but for an art form itself. He believes that great music can transform lives. Describing Leonard Bernstein, the great American conductor and educator, who wrote West Side Story in his spare time, a musician once said: \u2018Lenny reminds you why you wanted to become a musician in the first place.\u2019 That is Rattle\u2019s talent too but how he achieves it is hard to pin down. It is the conductor who makes all the difference as to whether a performance sinks or swims. What you see as he steps on to the podium, is the tip of a vast iceberg of activity involving planning, preparing, rehearsing, managing schedules and endless background work to understand the music. This is what helps make Simon Rattle one of the world\u2019s greatest, says his biographer Sir Nicholas Kenyon: \u2018He is a meticulous planner, has a fantastic insight for the right combination of pieces in a concert programme and is a brilliant pacer and galvaniser of rehearsals, knowing exactly what he has to achieve and motivating his players accordingly.\u2019 But it still fails to explain his achievements. When his performances take off, musicians and audiences alike would rather be nowhere else. It isn\u2019t so much a matter of his technique with the conductor\u2019s baton, or bringing in the trombones when they\u2019re feeling left out as something undefinable. In 1999, a critic memorably described him on the podium: \u2018Sometimes he bent to his knees, puffed his cheeks and mimed a straw-chewing yokel to encourage a proportionate rustic attitude in his players. That was especially during Beethoven\u2019s \u201cPastoral\u201d Symphony...During the pizzicato interlude in Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony, he dropped his hands to his sides and encouraged his band just to pluck \u2019n\u2019 swing.\u2019 What audiences see in Rattle is a man who feels that, for as long as he is conducting it, that piece is the most important thing in the world. Musicians, hardly sentimental, are happy to follow him because every concert is an adventure. As Rattle says: \u2018Always the journey, never the destination\u2019.

The City boss is under fire after seeing his team crash out of Europe to Barcelona for the second season in a row on Wednesday night. They must beat West Bromwich Albion at the Etihad this lunchtime (sat) to keep the pressure on Jose Mourinho\u2019s side, who are six points clear with a game in hand, and stay clear of the chasing pack. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has insisted that their season has not been a disaster .

We are not in eighth, ninth or 10th. Only Chelsea has done better than our team. \u2018As I said to the players, we are still in this competition.

A prize-winning Irish Setter allegedly 'murdered' at Crufts was actually poisoned after he returned to his\u00a0home country of Belgium, according to The Kennel Club. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone. But The Kennel Club, which runs Crufts, said toxicology reports revealed the fast-acting poison was consumed 28 hours after the dog show. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death. She said: 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death. 'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting. 'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours. 'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.' She said the poison was believed to have been given on a piece of beef that was largely undigested when the autopsy was performed on Saturday March 7 - the day Jagger died. The Club Secretary then pointed out that food is usually absorbed in dogs within six hours. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at world's biggest dog show, pictured with Aleksandra Lauwers's son Jeremy . Her comments were made amid fears\u00a0that at least six dogs were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show. But she said there was no evidence that any of the dogs taken ill at Crufts were actually given poison while at the show. 'We must stress that despite reports to the contrary which have caused a lot of concern to dog lovers, absolutely no dog has been shown to have been sick at or after Crufts due to poison ingested at the show, there are no veterinary reports or evidence to support this notion, and no official reports of poisoning have been made to the police,' she said. 'We have a lot of security measures in place to protect the dogs at our show and we continually review our procedures because the welfare and safety of the dogs is our first and main priority. 'Regardless of the fact that the poison was not ingested at Crufts a dog has very sadly died and we must now respect the owners' privacy and give them time to grieve.' Jagger suffered a fit and fell into a coma before dying in Aleksandra's arms back at the family home in the city of Tongeren, in Belgium. Two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death . She revealed a post mortem by a vet found cubes of meat laced with a toxin in his stomach and thought he may have been targeted at the show at Birmingham's NEC. The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans said Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, he told the Mail: \u2018I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it\u2019s unlikely because of the long time delay. \u2018I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.\u2019 Nick Sutton, health information officer at the Kennel Club, added: 'Regardless of the specifics surrounding this particular tragic incident, where Jagger's owners suspect malicious intent, this tragedy has shone the spotlight very firmly on the issue of poisoning. 'It is important that dog owners know that the majority of poison related deaths and illnesses in dogs in the UK are accidental. 'Some accidents could potentially be avoided if dog owners were to be aware of the common household and garden items that can be harmful to dogs, including chocolate, raisins, onions, some pesticides and garden plants, detergents and many human medicines.' The three-year-old Irish setter was 'best friend' to the couple's son, Jeremy. The family have vowed to find the person responsible for his 'slow and painful' death . Aleksandra Lauwers (pictured with Jeremy and the litter Jagger was born part of) said she and her son are struggling to cope with the dog's death . Aldicarb and carbofuran are carbamate insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the EU. Nick Edwards, senior information scientist for Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: 'We understand that the toxicology report says carbofuran and aldicarb, toxic carbamate pesticides - which are no longer approved for use in the EU - were found. 'We would expect the clinical effects, if ingested by a dog, to be rapid in onset; normally between half an hour and three hours. 'After this time a combination of clinical effects, if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities, would likely be present, including weakness, collapse, diarrhoea, slow heart rate, difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation.'",

        "article": "Prince Charles, pictured today, has been told his letters to ministers must be released despite warnings it would infringe his 'freedom of expression' Prince Charles's 'lobbying' of ministers is set to continue unabated \u2013 even though more than two dozen private letters already written by him on issues of Government policy will be made public within weeks. Clarence House yesterday expressed its 'disappointment' that the Supreme Court ruled the Attorney General had acted unlawfully in using a veto to block publication of his so-called 'black spider' memos. But senior royal sources also insisted to the Mail that the future king had no regrets about acting as an 'advocate' for his people. One said the judgment was 'unlikely to impact' on Charles doing what sees as his public duty. Yesterday's ruling by the UK's highest court follows a nine-year legal battle between the Government and The Guardian newspaper, which used the Freedom of Information Act to apply for 27 letters written by the Prince to senior politicians to be released. The Prime Minister also said he was disappointed by the ruling. Charles has long been accused of bombarding ministers with memos in an attempt to influence policy on issues close to his heart such as the environment, farming, the countryside, GM crops and complementary medicine. During the period in question \u2013 September 2004 to April 2005 \u2013 he wrote to seven Government departments: Business, Innovation and Skills; Health; Children, Schools and Families; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Culture, Media and Sport; the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office. The correspondence \u2013 nicknamed black spider memos because of Charles's scrawling handwriting and use of underlining and exclamation marks \u2013 is said, according to previous Attorney General Dominic Grieve, to contain 'full and frank' expressions of his 'most deeply held personal views'. The newspaper was initially successful in its application. In 2012, however, the Attorney General employed a rarely-used ministerial veto to block publication under Section 53 of the FOI Act. He said the public could interpret the letters sent to ministers in the last Labour government as showing Charles 'disagreeing with government policy'. This would be 'seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality\u2026 he cannot easily recover it when he is king'. That veto was challenged by The Guardian in the Supreme Court which ruled, by a majority of five to two, that the government did not have a right to overrule a decision taken by the courts. Charles and Camilla today spent today riding in a rickshaw at Clarence House to promote a race across Madhya Pradesh, India later this year . Views: An August 2000 letter from Lord Irvine, Tony Blair's mentor and later the Lord Chancellor, heavily annotated by Prince Charles in his 'black spider' handwriting . The seven Supreme Court judges made their ruling on two legal points. One was whether Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General in 2012, was right to issue a Section 53 certificate under the Freedom of Information Act, effectively blocking publication of the letters. The other question was whether an obscure EU directive \u2013 the 2003 Environmental Information Regulations \u2013 meant that any specific environmental information contained in Charles\u2019s letters must be published. Lord Neuberger, the court president, said the Court of Appeal had already rejected Mr Grieve\u2019s arguments that Charles\u2019s views must be kept private. He said that it was not lawful for \u2018a member of the executive to overrule a judicial decision simply because he disagrees with it\u2019. Four other judges agreed that the letters should be published but Lord Hughes and Lord Wilson disagreed. Lord Wilson said the Appeal Court judges had ignored the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Six of the judges said that environmental matters in Charles\u2019s letters should be made public under the EU directive. Discussions are under way as to how to co-ordinate the release of the 27 letters. This may not happen for several weeks but they are likely to prove embarrassing to the Prince. They cover issues such as the Armed Forces, the plight of foot and mouth-hit farmers and other rural concerns. They are probably the only letters to be released because the law has been changed to make correspondence by senior members of the Royal Family exempt from FOI requests. Mr Cameron echoed Clarence House's views yesterday, saying: 'This is a disappointing judgment and we will now consider how to release these letters. This is about the principle that senior members of the Royal Family are able to express their views to government confidentially.' A spokesman for the Prince said: 'Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.' David Cameron said the ruling was 'disappointing' and argued that senior Royals should be able to communicate with ministers 'confidentially' But senior royal sources also insisted that Charles and his team were quite 'sanguine' about the decision. 'This has come down to quite a narrow legal principle and was not about the content of the letters,' one said. The source rejected descriptions of the future king as a meddler, insisting he was an 'advocate' simply trying to shine a light on issues raised with him by members of the general public. Asked whether the ruling would stop the Prince writing to ministers, the source said: 'This is a small loophole in the law that the government have very quickly closed. I can't imagine it [the decision to publish] would impact on the Prince of Wales as he undertakes his public duties and service.' Letter lover: Prince Charles is said to have sent 1,000 letters a year at peak periods in his life . A defiant Prince Charles has always maintained he has the right  to express his forthright views to ministers even after he becomes King. At peak periods, his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers and other public figures. As the furore over his 'black spider' letters peaked in 2012, the heir to throne was said to be unrepentant about the row furore sparked by the Government's decision to stop 27 'particularly frank' letters written to ministers in the last Labour government to be revealed. Courtiers told the Mail that it is the prince's 'right and absolute duty' to correspond with politicians over issues that affect his country and future subjects. And sources close to the prince made clear that Charles will continue to air his opinions, even during his private meetings with the Prime Minister after he accedes to the throne. 'The Prince of Wales absolutely sees it as his duty to make his views known to ministers,' they said. 'He is a man of passionate belief and will always strive to make his views clear.' As a self-confessed 'interfering busybody', Charles has become renowned for expressing his strong views on a huge variety of issues ranging from youth opportunity to architecture and the environment. His prolific missives are known as 'black spider memos' because of his scrawled handwriting. Explaining his willingness to get involved in issues and causes he said himself: 'The trouble is, I always feel that unless I rush about doing things and trying to help furiously, I will not (and the monarchy will not) be seen to be relevant and I will be considered a mere playboy.'",

Jamie Hyde, from Morchard Bishop, Devon, died after suffering a rare reaction to a general anaesthetic during the routine operation at Tiverton and District Hospital. Anaesthetist Dr Andrei Rebrov did not realise initially that he had  suffered an anaphylactic shock and so Mr Hyde went for more than one hour without being given potentially life-saving treatment. Jamie Hyde, 41, from Morchard Bishop, Devon, died after suffering an anaphylactic shock  during a routine hernia operation, in which the\u00a0anaesthetist was 'too proud' too ask other doctors for help for at least one hour . Mr Hyde suffered a rare reaction to the\u00a0anaesthetic during a routine hernia operation at Tiverton and District Hospital (pictured). He later went into cardiac arrest after he not being given potentially life-saving treatment . The inquest into his death in Exeter, Devon, heard how Mr Hyde's heart rate and blood pressure began rising and falling rapidly after he was given the\u00a0anaesthetic. At one point his heart rate fell to 30 beats per minute and nurse Lizzie Charlton-Ann suggested calling 999. But the inquest heard that Dr Rebrov refused to do so and instead called the critical care unit at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter. He also turned down an offer of help from another doctor on site who was also an anaesthetist. Mr Hyde later went into cardiac arrest and was given CPR before being transferred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was placed on life support having suffered brain damage. His family turned off his machine on May 27, 2013, after he stopped responding to tests. Dr Rebrov said he had received training on how to deal with anaphylactic shocks but had not encountered one before. Coroner Elizabeth Earland asked Dr Michael Seymour, the surgeon who was in the operating theatre at the time, whether Dr Rebrov froze. He said: 'I don't think he froze, I think he reacted to the situation he was in but one of the problems was whatever he tried to do, worked for a while then Jamie deteriorated again.' Mr Hyde was moved to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter, Devon (pictured) and was put on life support after suffering brain damage, the inquest heard. However, he died a few days later on May 27, 2013 . The coroner heard how Mr Hyde had not been worried about the hernia operation beforehand and had expected to return home the same day. Mr Hyde's sister Catherine told the inquest that she believes Dr Rebrov was 'too proud' to ask for help when complications arose. She said: 'When I first saw Dr Rebrov at the hospital he was very upset and tearful. He said Jamie was a very nice guy. 'I felt sorry for him, but now I feel he was too proud to ask for help.' Nurse Ms Charlton- Ann said: 'I have always had it drummed into me from working on the ward to call 999 any time you think a patient's life is in danger.' Dr Earland, who delivered a narrative verdict, said strenuous efforts were made to save Mr Hyde. She said: 'At the time, the doctor who had administered the drugs did not know he was suffering an anaphylactic reaction as he was not displaying the usual symptoms.' Following the inquest,\u00a0Martin Cooper, medical director at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, told MailOnline: 'We wish to express our condolences to Mr Hyde's family and recognise his death was tragic. 'The coroner concluded that his death was due to the effects of an unexpected and very rare anaphylactic reaction. 'The Trust undertook full investigation into the circumstances. 'The results of this investigation were explained to the coroner, together with the actions that the Trust had taken to improve the management of anaphylaxis in the operating theatre situation.' Mr Cooper said improvements included surgery teams receiving further training and additional drugs\u00a0used in anaesthetic emergencies being made available. He said the Trust had also rolled out a programme to community theatre staff in 'critical incident' training.",

Aldi, the budget supermarket, is to be the official supermarket of Team GB as they prepare for the Olympic Games in Brazil in 2016. The idea of a German-owned company helping Britain\u2019s athletes achieve their sporting potential may appear incongruous, however the group has enormous financial muscle. Budget German supermarket, Aldi, has been named as the official sponsor of Team GB at the 2016 Olympics . It is understood that Aldi will subsidise the costs of training camps and equipment as well as funding community and youth sports schemes with the British Olympic Association (BOA). Some people may question why British retail giants like Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons were not interested in this sort of partnership. Sainsbury\u2019s has a long association with British athletics and the Paralympics. Aldi\u2019s partnership with Team GB is part of a wider strategy to install the brand as a beacon of healthy, quality, British food. The chain has made a concerted effort to attract families from across the social spectrum, particularly middle and higher income shoppers. Aldi\u2019s partnership with Team GB is part of a wider strategy to promote the brand as a beacon of healthy, quality, British food . As a result, sales are growing at around 19 per cent a year and it now has a market share of five per cent, putting it almost on a par with Waitrose. Olympic legend and gold medallist, Lord Coe, the chairman of the BOA, said: \u2018Everyone associated with Team GB is thrilled to have a partner which has so captured the imagination of the British public. \u2018They are a great and growing British employer and are championing British produce and suppliers. Their support is a huge boost in our efforts to get the nation inspired in the run up to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\u2019 Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the British Olympics Association, said he is 'thrilled' with the backing from Aldi . The BOA\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, added: \u2018We\u2019re delighted to have Aldi join us on our road to Rio 2016 and their support will play a key role in the team\u2019s success at the Olympic Games. \u2018Their drive for excellence matches our own and we\u2019re looking forward to working with them on our community and sporting engagement programmes, as well as supporting the athletes heading out to Brazil next year. Aldi is a growing, impressive brand in the UK and is a great fit with Team GB.\u2019 Aldi\u2019s UK chief executive, Matthew Barnes, said: \u2018Our partnership with Team GB is the perfect way to celebrate our landmark 25th anniversary in the UK and we are proud of the investment Aldi has made in Britain over the last 25 years. \u2018Our passion to offer our customers access to fresh, affordable and healthy food is unrivalled. Our continued drive to buy locally produced products and commitment to our extensive fresh food range are just some of the reasons why more and more people are choosing to shop with us. \u2018We are truly honoured to be supporting the extraordinary Team GB athletes on the road to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\u2019 The partnership was sealed at an event at the BOA\u2019s London headquarters yesterday, which was attended by Team GB athletes Samantha Murray, from Modern Pentathlon, and BMX cyclist, Liam Phillips. The news of the firm\u2019s focus on health and fitness coincided with news Aldi is to launch a new \u2018boutique\u2019 wine range to tap in to the tastes of the higher income shoppers they are now attracting. The wines include a Malbec Cabernet, Tasmanian Chardonnay, Pezenas and a Valle De Leyda Sauvignon, which at \u00a39.99 are more than double the cost of its normal range.",

        "article": "President Barack Obama made jokes about himself and others at the 130th annual Gridiron Club and Foundation dinner . Getting older changes a guy, President Barack Obama says, and he admits he's getting crankier. 'Next week I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn,' Obama joked Saturday night at the Gridiron Club and Foundation's annual dinner. On top of that, the nation's graying chief executive said he's having trouble now with his morning cup of joe. 'Coffee really disagrees with me these days,' he said, 'which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House.' Obama's standup routine drew laughs from the audience of more than 650 journalists, lawmakers, administration officials, military officials and others at the Gridiron's 130th gathering. By tradition, Washington insiders put aside their differences for an evening of laughter, schmoozing and charity fundraising. With the president providing the gibes on behalf of his administration, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe sharpened their wits for the Republicans and Democrats, respectively. Walker is considering a run for the GOP nomination for president while McAuliffe's political connections extend to his work as Democratic Party chairman and Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton ally. Obama targeted himself \u2014 'Just a few years ago I couldn't imagine being in my 50s. Given my approval ratings, I still can't' \u2014 as well as people in the government and the media that cover it. Noting that Walker remarked recently that he couldn't say whether Obama was a Christian, the president said his religion taught forgiveness and cracked, 'So, Gov. Walker, salaam alaikum.' Obama said he generally likes Boehner, the House speaker, and noted talk of unhappy House Republicans planning a coup \u2014 'or as Bill O'Reilly calls it, \"reporting from the war zone.\"' Walker got in his own digs. 'I believe that the President of the United States loves America and every American \u2014 except Rudy Giuliani.' He also joked about his failure to finish his college degree as he envisioned himself in the White House: 'If my first term is anything like college, I won't make it through four years.' McAuliffe joined others in needling the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton. 'If Hillary decides not to run... I decided not to finish that joke,' he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (left) and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (right) sharpened their wits for the Republicans and Democrats, respectively, at the dinner . He also joked, 'Are any of the Secret Service sober enough to drive me home?' The Gridiron Club and Foundation, founded in 1885, has drawn every president after Grover Cleveland to its annual dinner at least once. Obama made his third appearance on Saturday, having attended in 2011 and 2013. An early script for the evening's musical send-ups included a jab at Republicans preparing presidential campaigns, sung to the tune of 'If I Only Had a Brain' from 'The Wizard of Oz.' One stanza singled out former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: 'He'd be talking to reporters, 'bout walling up the borders/ It'd be a fine campaign./And his head he'd be scratchin' while his thoughts were busy hatchin'/If he only had a brain.' To the tune of Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' came this crack aimed at Hillary Clinton: 'First lady's second-rate/an' secretary-ya state/Those jobs don't satiate/this hungry candidate./Well Benghazi left not trace, those emails got erased/That's the Clinton way-ee-ya. What eye do is okay-ee-ya. Active membership in the Gridiron Club and Foundation is limited to 65 journalists based in Washington. Money raised through the dinner goes to college scholarships and journalistic organizations.",

        "article": "Mexicans take it literally when they amp themselves up for a night out in their country's capital. A drinking game popular in Mexico City takes shock-factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity, and they connect themselves to a live current. Known as 'toques' - Spanish for 'touches' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city, and has seen players' nights-out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room. 'The drunker people get, the more voltage they can generally handle,' says Javier Rodriguez, who has worked the lively Condesa neighbourhood of Mexico City for the past 35 years. Scroll down for video . Electricuting: Javier Rodriguez has been offering drinkers the chance to play 'toques' for 35 years . Painful: It requires a player to withstand as many volts of electricity coursing through their body as possible . Cheap thrills: People pay\u00a0 \u00a31.50 for a round, and Javier can expect to make more than \u00a3300 in a weekend . 'I've seen party-goers pass out after passing 100 volts, although it usually has something to do with what they've been drinking.' 'It's fun,' said Leonardo Flores, who eagerly took up the challenge when Javier passed by clicking the metal handles to make the sound known throughout the capital as a toques vendor. 'It gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards,' he told the MailOnline, who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right. 'People also say it makes hangovers less painful, but that hasn't ever been my experience.' Javier walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning, clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit, which can reach up to 120 volts. UK mains supply runs at around 240 volts. 'It's a long-standing tradition here in Mexico,' he said. 'I've been hired to offer the game at private events: weddings, funerals, Sweet 16 birthday parties, town fairs, political dinners, pretty much everything. 'It's become part of our country's drinking culture. Wherever Mexicans are drinking in large numbers, you can be certain someone is going around offering the electrocution game.' 'Fun': Despite pictures suggesting the contrary, some people claim they enjoy the sensation . Device: The two handles send volts of electricity through the player's body, starting off at just 20 volts . Secret cure: It is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less \u00a0severe in the morning . Each round costs \u00a31.50, and Javier can expect to make more than \u00a3300 on a lively weekend in Condesa, one of Mexico City's most popular nightlife districts. Good business, given that that Mexican minimum wage stands at under \u00a3150 a month, and that his only expenses are eight AA batteries every three or so weeks. He claims Mexicans are always his best clients, and that not only are international visitors less likely to participate, but that they are generally underperformers. 'Mexicans know what to expect, but it's rare to see foreigners do well,' he boasted, 'Foreigners are generally very cowardly, and get very scared when it comes to this game.' The MailOnline tried its hand at toques, and can report difficulty in typing up the experience the following day. The game starts slowly, and the current noticeably takes the shortest route through the body: along the inside of the forearms, up through the armpit and across the upper back if the game is played the traditional way \u2013 holding a metal handle in either hand. A tingling sensation is apparent at around twenty volts, which increases in intensity and reach, as the dial is turned up towards the 120-volt maximum. Upwards of 60 volts the wrists begin to bend inward under the force of the current, and past 80 volts the hands become completely paralysed \u2013 unable to let go of the circuit even if the player would want to. It's little wonder Javier says players rarely surpass 85 volts. The MailOnline's reporter reached 80 and the pain was excruciating. Guinea pig: MailOnline's Alasdair Baverstock decided to test his pain threshold against the electricity . Challenge: According to Javier, foreigners are not very good at toques . 'Excrutiating': Alasdair can confirm, having reached 80 volts, the game is exceedingly painful . Low cost: The 'shock box' only requires eight AA batteries, which last about three weeks . Although the shocks may be painful, it would take more than 10 times the highest amount to even get close to killing a human being. Electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered 'usually fatal'. For burns to occur, there would need to be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 volts of electricity - although defibrillators can use up to 1,000 volts to get a heart beating once more. Conversely, electric shocks can also stop the heart from beating properly, prevent breathing and cause painful muscle spasms. The voltage causes current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles. More than 2.5million people in the UK suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year, according to statistics from Electrical Safety First. In 1890, murderer William Kemmler was the first man to be executed in the United States by electric chair. A voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him. The game stops only when the player asks - or screams - for it to end, signalling the man with the battery pack to cut the power. The ordeal is generally followed by restorative tequila shots, which bar staff continue to serve up to clients no matter how drunk they are. 'The average score is from 70 to 85 volts,' says Javier, who recommends that his more zealous clients undergo regular two-minute 40-volt sessions in the belief that the electricity helps an individual's blood pressure and stress levels - although whether the current helps to increase or decrease he does not mention. 'I woke up the morning after I played toques, and I felt like my tongue was burned,' said Oscar Gonzalez, a Venezuelan marketing consultant who moved to Mexico City last year. 'It's a crazy game and I can't really see the benefit. It's one of those inexplicable things about Mexican culture.' The game is played competitively solo, although multiple people can play together by forming a human chain; touching hands, noses, lips, ears, buttocks or any other piece of bare skin which will allow electricity to flow. 'The hands are relatively easy to withstand,' says Javier. 'I've seen people get up to 50 volts by touching tongues.' When played in a group, the drinking element of toques becomes more prevalent, as the person who breaks the chain first is often punished by having to drink shots of tequila. Team sport?: People can play alone, or in groups like this one - sending electricity through each other . Not just for the drinkers: 'You'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour, without having touched a drop of alcohol that day,' Javier told MailOnline . 'If you get to the upper limits of the voltage you actually start to feel tingling in your brain,' said Ignacio Alonso, a Mexico City native who reached 90 volts before screaming for mercy, a trial sandwiched by shots of the rudimentary and potent mescal, a spirit similar to tequila. Eight AA batteries power the 'shock box', which Javier carries around with him to offer the game to party-goers and ordinary office workers alike. 'I start work at 3pm,' he says. 'You'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour, without having touched a drop of alcohol that day.' Travelling is difficult for Javier, since he is not allowed to take his equipment on aeroplanes inside his hand luggage, and has been questioned in the past by airport bomb squads over the contents of his checked suitcase. 'Officers in international airports rarely understand that it's just a game,' he chuckles. The maximum of 120 volts is not enough to damage human tissue, although players with heart pacemakers should not take on the challenge.",

Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt. Patricia Kelley, 70, who had raised Reid since she was a baby, said the victim had always 'wanted a big booty.' Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt . The nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time. 'Your butt's getting too big,' Kelley recalled telling her. 'But she got hooked on them booty shots,' she told the Dallas News. Reid 's fourth visit took place on February 18 and police found her body inside the business at 7am the next morning. The building had been cleaned out and her purse and cellphone were missing. Police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks. Suspects: Dallas police are hunting Denise Rochelle 'Wee Wee' Ross (left) and Jimmy Joe Clarke - also known as 'Alicia' - (right) who are linked to botched butt injections carried out on two women, one of whom died . Police issued arrest warrants on Wednesday on charges of practicing medicine without a license for Denise 'Wee Wee' Ross, 43, and Jimmy Clarke, 31, who also is known as Alicia. The body was found by Clarke at 7.50 a.m. and Reid's daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have 'butt injections' and that a woman who goes by the name of 'Wee Wee' and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure. Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died. She claims that Reid arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she 'was not well and wanted to lay down', so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on Reid's buttocks, according to Wfaa.com. Reid's family are calling for the pair to be brought to justice. 'I want to see them on trial for murder,' said Keaira Reid, 20. 'I'm very mad because anybody could have called 911.' Wykesha Reid had always 'wanted a big booty' and the nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time . The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited the salon on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when 'unknown' substances were used on her. The holes were then closed with superglue, she said. She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. The suspects' whereabouts are currently unknown. Neither are registered with the Texas Medical Board. Dallas County court records show Clarke has convictions for prostitution, lewd public conduct and possession of cocaine. Ross has convictions for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, assault, possession of drugs and theft.",

Chan and Sukumaran are awaiting their execution by firing squad on Nusakambangan, in Cilacap, off Central Java, while they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy. On Channel 7's Sunday Night it was revealed Sukuraman knows the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the heroin syndicate he was convicted of being part of - but has never wanted to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family. Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer. 'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said. 'They wouldn't and then the lawyers advised us not to go that way.' Scroll down for video .

The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island. Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port. Hopeful that it won\u2019t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey. The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.' Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

Myuran Sukuraman (right) revealed he knew the identity of ringleader Mr Big and tried to strike a deal with Indonesian police to spare his life, while Chan (left) denied he knew anything about him . The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said. 'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives. 'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.' On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java. Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling . Indonesian police stand guard to secure the area around Kerobokan prison in Denpasar on Bali island on March 4 . Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you\u2019re a convicted criminal.' Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars. Myuran Sukuraman being led to an armoured vehicle at Cilacap airport in Central Java on Wednesday . Andrew Chan took a bible with him to the 'death island' on Wednesday . At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint. This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated. Sukuraman also admitted on Sunday Night he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him. 'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said.

Di Maria\u2019s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. He wasn\u2019t getting hooked at half-time before this event. Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family\u2019s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened. Di Maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new, high-level apartment following their traumatic experience. Angel di Maria has seen his form drop off in recent months and has been substituted in the last few games . Di Maria has been replaced in Manchester United's last two Premier League games . Alvaro Negredo had a tough time at Manchester City and left for\u00a0Valencia . Negredo has returned to Spain on loan with Valencia . The player would not be human if he was unaffected, particularly as - like Negredo - he is still learning to speak English and must already feel quite alone. Manchester City came to the conclusion that Negredo was lost to them, and only a return to Spain would solve his problems. Manchester United may decide this is also the case with Di Maria \u2014 but have so much more to lose, financially, if he departs at the end of the season.",

Forest of Dean District Council accepted a humiliating motion criticising it for \u2018scandalous waste\u2019 over the past eight years after an ambush by Labour members. They forced through the vote, demanding an \u2018unqualified apology\u2019, when the ruling Conservatives were left short of numbers at a meeting this week. Forest of Dean District Council was forced to apologise for squandering over \u00a3500,000 on renovation work . The council was criticised for spending nearly \u00a3400,000 on renovating a reception area at its offices and another \u00a3120,000 on demolishing a building which they failed to sell and which has lain empty for four years. It was also attacked for shutting the district\u2019s tourism information offices and imposing charges for pest control, bulk waste and garden waste collections and car parking. The apology has already been posted on the authority\u2019s website and in press releases. Labour councillor Di Martin, who introduced the motion, said the Conservative administration, which has run the council in Gloucestershire for eight years, \u2018has failed miserably to listen to the people of the Forest of Dean and as a result they have been badly let down, an unqualified apology is due\u2019. Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion . She added: \u2018An apology is needed for the scandalous waste of taxpayers\u2019 money on the refurbishment of the district council\u2019s reception area [at a cost of \u00a3383,320]. \u2018The cost of refurbishment was meant to be recouped by the sale of Lawnstone House, which is now to be demolished at a further cost of \u00a3120,000.\u2019 Last night Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained why his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion, which he dismissed as a \u2018blatant piece of electioneering\u2019. \u2018We didn\u2019t take part in the debate. We were down on our numbers and we weren\u2019t sure we\u2019d have the support to win in the chamber so we didn\u2019t vote,\u2019 he said. \u2018We don\u2019t regret it because it\u2019s a stupid motion \u2013 it\u2019s ill-founded and if anybody should hang their head in shame it is Di Martin. \u2018We were voted the most-improved council in the country in 2013 and if that\u2019s something we should apologise for, she\u2019s completely lost the plot.\u2019 Mr Molyneux added that the renovation work to the council\u2019s offices \u2013 which included \u00a313,550 to replace a CCTV system \u2013 was essential as it made the building more accessible to the disabled. \u2018It does seem like a lot but the old block where the reception was wasn\u2019t disabled friendly. If she thinks that\u2019s a waste of money, she\u2019s missing the plot.\u2019 Independent members of the council criticised the \u2018mud-slinging contest\u2019 between the two main parties.",

        "article": "(CNN)Jeremy Clarkson won't have his contract renewed as host of \"Top Gear\" after he apparently busted his producer's lip and verbally abused him, the BBC announced Wednesday. Clarkson, who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world, was suspended on March 10 after what the British broadcaster previously described as a \"fracas\" with producer Oisin Tymon on March 4. Wednesday, the BBC released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident. Ken MacQuarrie, who conducted the investigation, said Tymon had been \"subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson\" at a hotel in North Yorkshire after a day of filming. \"During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip,\" he said. The physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness, MacQuarrie said, but Clarkson continued to use \"derogatory and abusive language\" for a sustained period of time. MacQuarrie said Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to BBC management. BBC Director General Tony Hall issued a statement announcing Clarkson was being dropped. \"A member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature. For me a line has been crossed,\" he said. \"I know how popular the program is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion.\" \"Top Gear,\" fronted by Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it. Clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about, both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns. In his statement, Hall referenced the BBC's diversity, saying it was \"a broad church.\" \"We need distinctive and different voices but they cannot come at any price. Common to all at the BBC have to be standards of decency and respect,\" he said. North Yorkshire police issued a statement Wednesday saying they had asked for the BBC's report on the incident. \"The information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by North Yorkshire Police where necessary,\" they said. On March 10, the BBC announced that \"Top Gear's\" March 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live \"Top Gear\" shows scheduled for next week in Stavanger, Norway. However, it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would \"run as scheduled.\" Hall said the BBC would \"look to renew 'Top Gear' for 2016\" and that he had asked BBC controller Kim Shillinglaw to \"look at how we put out the last programs in the current series.\" After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to \"I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear.\" On Wednesday, the wording became past tense: \"I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear.\" Co-host Richard Hammond tweeted: \"Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together.\" Fans had earlier expressed outrage at the BBC decision to suspend Clarkson. Even media baron Rupert Murdoch commented on speculation that Clarkson would be sacked, posting a tweet Tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a \"funny man with great expertise.\" An online petition to have Clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people. Fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired. Last week, a fan dressed as the \"Stig\" -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the BBC's London headquarters in an armored tank to present the \"Bring Back Clarkson\" petition. Clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times. According to the BBC website, Clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism. It also adds: \"Terrifyingly, he might just be the most influential man in motoring.\" Clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998, and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with Hammond and May. The trio's long-distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status. In 2013, Guinness World Records named \"Top Gear\" the world's most widely watched factual program, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show is sold to 214 territories worldwide. Local versions have been made in the United States, China, Russia, Australia and South Korea. While Clarkson's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers, his on- and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense. Last year, he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that wasn't aired. \"I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,\" Clarkson said in video statement posted online. He's been accused on other occasions of racism, including characterizing Mexicans as \"lazy and feckless\" and using the word \"slope\" over footage of an Asian man crossing a bridge during a \"Top Gear\" special in Myanmar. Producer Andy Wilman later apologized, calling it a \"light-hearted word play joke,\" and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to Asians. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. A CNN reporter who was at the event said Clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC had \"f**ked themselves\" and had ruined a great show. Clarkson later brushed off the incident, saying the rant was meant \"in jest\" and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the \"Top Gear\" race track. CNN's Rosie Tomkins and journalist Monica Sarkar contributed to this report.",

Carradine, 60, and his wife, Edie Mani, were both injured in the afternoon crash on March 5\u00a0near Dolores, in the state's southwestern corner, but the injuries are not life-threatening. According to the Colorado State Patrol, the actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder crossed into the oncoming lane on Colorado Highway 145 and collided with the tractor-trailer. The couple, who had been wearing seatbelts, were removed from the car and taken to Southwest Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Mercy Regional Medical Center in Durango. Scroll down for video . Cited: Actor Robert Carradine and his wife Edie, pictured in 2004, were injured after he drove across a highway into oncoming traffic but have been released from hospital. He has been cited with careless driving . It's unclear how long they were there. But neither was listed as being at the hospital Thursday, Mercy Regional spokesman David Bruzzese said. The truck driver, 59-year-old Richard Clayton of Wisconsin, wasn't injured, Trooper Josh Lewis said. James Saunders of the state patrol told The Durango Herald that neither alcohol nor speeding was a factor in the crash. Images of the scene also show that it was not snowing or raining at the time. 'The fact that they were wearing seat belts is why they are with us today,' he said. The area of the highway was shut for more than two hours following the crash. A publicist for Carradine has yet to respond to a request for comment on the actor's condition, but Carradine was back using his Twitter account earlier this week. Wreckage: The actor's 2003 Mercury Marauder, pictured, was destroyed after he crossed into the path of the truck last week. He and his wife were removed from the car and taken to hospital . Collision: The driver of the semi-truck, pictured, did not suffer any injuries in the crash. Authorities do not know what caused Carradine to veer towards the truck but said alcohol and speeding were not factors . The youngest of a prolific acting family, Robert Carradine worked steadily in film and television for more than 40 years. He and half-brother David Carradine often could be seen in the same projects, including the TV series 'Kung Fu,' Walter Hill's 'The Long Riders,' and Paul Bartel's 'Cannonball.' Robert Carradine's biggest hit came in 1984 with the off-color comedy 'Revenge of the Nerds,' in which he played head nerd Lewis Skolnick. He reprised the role in the big screen sequel and two small-screen follow-ups. More recently, Quentin Tarantino cast Robert Carradine as a tracker in the 2012 film 'Django Unchained.' Tarantino is filming his latest movie, 'The Hateful Eight,' in nearby Telluride, Colorado, but the Weinstein Co. said Carradine is not involved with that project. He has three children; a daughter from a previous relationship and a daughter and a son with Mani. Famous role: Carradine is well known for his role in the 1984 comedy, Revenge of the Nerds .",

Falcao has not played a minute for United\u2019s first team since being dragged off in the home win over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal\u2019s team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday night. Now the \u00a3250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21s against Tottenham. He didn\u2019t score and was taken off as it ended 1-1. Radamel Falcao was humiliated by being dumped in Manchester United's Under 21s team on Tuesday night . Louis van Gaal could be waving goodbye to Falcao in the summer after dropping him to the reserves . The Colombia striker\u2019s demotion underlines Van Gaal\u2019s concern over his fitness. The United manager usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury. Falcao has been injury-free since recovering from a thigh strain in November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level when he is desperate to prove he is worth a permanent deal. Falcao did not manage to get on the scoresheet against Tottenham Hotspur's Under 21s and was poor . The \u00a3250,000-a-week loanee tries to escape from Tottenham's Gongani Khumalo (left) and Grant Ward (right) Having scored only four times in six months, Falcao\u2019s chances of being retained in the summer are almost nil. But he feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by Van Gaal. Sportsmail reported earlier this year that the 29-year-old feels he has to work twice as hard to impress Van Gaal than other players. Van Gaal (back, left) did not bring on Falcao (middle, second right) in Monday night's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal .",

        "article": "The secret of how the legendary Star Wars spaceship the Millennium Falcon was built has been revealed - in a high-security project codenamed 'Magic Roundabout' in the Welsh countryside. The only full-size model of Han Solo's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making. Newly released photographs show dozens of joiners, welders and metal-platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by Harrison Ford in the famous science fiction series. Scroll down for video . Engineering foreman John Clark and two friends are pictured beside the life-size Millennium Falcon model in a newly released photo of the project . The distinctive shape of the Millennium Falcon is clearly recognisable in the second photo taken by Mr Clark . A group of workers go over the plans for the massive spaceship during its construction at Pembroke Dock . It was built inside an aircraft hangar with workers involved in the project sworn to secrecy . The huge prop was made inside an aircraft hangar which had been home to the Sunderland flying boats during the Second World War. The giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits, photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy. But one amateur photographer managed to get a snap of the 'fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy' as it was nearing completion. The never before seen picture shows how the Millennium Falcon earned its wings in the town of Pembroke Dock. John Evans, a historian in the town, said: 'Star Wars has a global following and this is yet another great reason for tourists to come here. 'Pembroke Dock is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps, be it Navy, Army or Air Force. 'But there is also this incredible link to Star Wars which is almost a cult thing and a 21st century concept. 'People can still see the very building where the Millennium Falcon was made.' The photograph was taken by local man John Clark, a foreman with Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that serviced the UK's petrochemical and oil industries. Work on the model (pictured) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in Hertfordshire . Mr Clark recalled: 'One of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the Star Wars films. 'I was very surprised that we'd gone that type of work because we built stuff for the oil industry and the offshore industry, but we got the contract. It was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework. 'I was foreman on the job at the time. When we built it - as you can see on the photographs - we had it on hover pads on the legs so that it could be moved as though it was going to take off and so forth. 'We tried to keep it as much a secret as possible because you didn't want everybody prying and coming round the hangar, but it got out. People were prying and trying to see what was going on but half of them didn't believe it, saying: \"Building a spaceship? That's rubbish\".' He said the Millennium Falcon was then disassembled into pieces so it could be transported to the studios in Hertfordshire. 'The artists in the film industry, the craftsman, went to work on it and made it into what you see on The Empire Strikes Back.' This rare photograph was taken during the top-secret project which was codenamed Magic Roundabout . Work on the spaceship finished in 1979 and the prop was then transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire . The company had been asked by filmmakers to build a life-sized, moving prop for key scenes in the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back. And Mr Clark used his pocket-sized 110 camera to get a colour photograph of himself and two friends standing next to the Millennium Falcon. Work on the spaceship finished shortly after the picture was taken in 1979 and the prop was transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash around the world. This was followed up by the third film in the trilogy, 1983's Return of the Jedi. A permanent exhibition of Star Wars photographs, artefacts and memorabilia is being opened to celebrate Pembroke Dock's links with the iconic movie franchise. Mr Evans added: 'This has been a huge thing for us. 'This is great for tourism and a very unique claim to fame for Pembroke Dock.' Han Solo's much-loved Millennium Falcon (pictured) has taken a unique place in pop culture . In the 38 years since it first appeared on the big screen, the space ship piloted by Han Solo and his Wookiee assistant Chewbacca in the original Star Wars series has become an easily recognizable piece of pop culture. Armed with laser cannons and the famed 'hyperdrive' technology, it featured in the first movie A New Hope and went on to become a regular setting throughout the series. Such is the high esteem in which fans hold it, the exact specifications of the model, its weaponry, shielding systems and engines have all been meticulously documented. The ship is technically a light freighter measuring 111ft in length by 82ft wide. While it is rounded and flat in shape, it measures 26ft high - inclusive of the attached exterior weaponry. Its maximum speed is 1,050kmph. But this is vastly surpassed when it goes into 'hyperdrive' - a mode illustrated in the films when the stars surrounding it appear stretched or blurred as it travels through light years within the space of hours. The ship is powered by five different engines - primarily a 'Quadrex power core' and four backup or emergency generators. Its main weapons are 2G Quad Laster cannons and a hidden ground-defence blaster cannon, though many other improvised weapons make brief appearances in the films. Capable of carrying six passengers, it is crewed by two people - those usually being Han Solo or Chewbacca - with provisions for two others to man guns during space battles. The ship was piloted by Harrison Ford's character Han Solo (right). Here he pictured next to Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia and Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker .

And as if questions over the colour of their skin wasn't enough for the young fellas, they also have the added complication of having different birthdays - with Jayden being born on November 6 and Xavier coming into the world after midnight, making his birthday November 7. Scroll down for video . Jayden and Xavier Boughey may look like they are from different families but they are in fact twins . The gorgeous 11-year-old boys also have different birthdays after Xavier (right) was born after midnight . The beautiful boys, who look strikingly alike despite their obvious differences, have their parents to thank for their mishmash of genes. Their mother, Helen Castles, 32. brings the dark skin to the family, which she inherited from her grandmother, who is Samoan. Their father is the complete opposite - Phil Boughey, 36, has a white complexion and fair hair. When the pair found out they were expecting twins, they wondered how their children would look, but could  never could have dreamed of the conclusion. 'We were surprised for sure - the running joke is because they were made in the Bahamas that Helen had the local Bohemian milkman stop by one day when I was at work to make the brown one,' their dad Phil\u00a0Boughey told Daily Mail Australia. 'But we don't really see it as a huge deal they just look different like any siblings can.' Their parents joke that because the boys were conceived in the Bahamas the local milkman dropped by to make the 'brown one' Xavier (left) is carefree and Jayden (right) is responsible and as the oldest of the two is a born leader . Now the boys have just started a new school, Sacred Heart, and are tasked with the unenviable challenge of trying to explain to their peers that they are related. 'They do get a lot of people believing they are not twins especially school kids,' he said. 'We make sure they are in different classes at school too because Jayden is the stronger one and Xavier will just sit back and ride on the coat tails of Jayden - so we have had to pull him out of the clouds.' The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a parent is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin. However, if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black. But the boys embrace the attention they get for looking so different. 'They think it's perfect - they think it's great because they are twins but they are individual and celebrate different birthdays,' their proud dad said . Sometimes Xavier gets jealous of his brother's bronze skin. 'We went out fishing in the boat the other day and Xavier and I had to put sunscreen on while Jayden just lay there with his shirt off getting tanned without any sunblock,' he said. According to their father, the boys have contrasting personalties but do have a strong twin bond. 'They are best friends and always will be,' he said. 'Xavier has a very dry sense of humour whereas Jayden is more outgoing and takes the lead as the older boy,' he said. 'Whenever I'm away for work he will always be responsible and make sure the house is locked up whereas Xavier is carefree and relaxed.' Xavier (left) gets jealous of his brother's bronze skin because he doesn't have to wear sunscreen - pictured with their mum Helen Castles and her father Pat Castles . The boys are in different classes so Xavier (right) doesn't ride on the coat tails of his older brother by a day . Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . Their story comes after a pair of 18-year-old girls, from Gloucester, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Lucy and Maria Aylmer, who looks completely different \u00a0told\u00a0ITV's\u00a0Good Morning Britain\u00a0that their classmates did not believe them when they told them they were twins. Their mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin.",

        "article": "For a player that has yet to regularly score at club level, Nicklas Bendtner certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a Denmark shirt. The former Arsenal striker became an outcast at the Gunners and is now struggling for game time at Wolfsburg. But a hat-trick against the USA on Wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level. Here Sportsmail looks at the Dane's international scoring record as well as nine other hot-shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs. Ali Daei (International caps 149, goals 109) Ali Daei is in a league of his own. As the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country. Ali Daei celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich against Hamburg during his short stay with the German giants . Daei was prolific for Iran and featured in the 1998 World Cup where he played against the USA (above) But the striker found banging goals in for Iran was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in Germany. Bayern Munich signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at Hertha Berlin, who offloaded him to Dubai in 2002 following just six league goals. Stern John (Trinidad & Tobago - International caps 115, goals 70) With an international strike rate better than Luis Suarez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robin van Persie, you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the Premier League. Birmingham's Stern John (right) goes down under pressure from Bolton's Jay-Jay Okocha in 2002 . England's John Terry clears the ball off the line in front of John and Rio Ferdinand during the Three Lions' 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago at the group stages of the 2006 World Cup . But Stern John never stood out during his two years at Birmingham between 2002 and 2004, while Sunderland also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight. It certainly doesn't reflect well on the international opponents Trinidad & Tobago must have been playing. Lukas Podolski (Germany - International caps 122, goals 48) Since making his international debut over 11 years ago, Lukas Podolski has gone on to become a regular for Germany, winning over 120 caps and of course the World Cup last year. Arsenal's Lukas Podolski (right) fends off Bayern Munich's Javi Martinez during a Champions League game . Podolski has over 120 caps for Germany and took a selfie with Bastian Schweinsteiger after winning the 2014 World Cup in Brazil last summer following a 1-0 victory over Argentina in the final . His international breakthrough came while starring for Cologne but since moving to Bayern Munich in 2006, his club form never again hit the same consistent heights. A flop at Bayern and frozen out at Arsenal, he is now toiling on loan at Inter Milan from the Gunners. Milan Baros (Czech Republic - International caps 93, goals 41) Between 2002 and 2008, Milan Baros failed to establish himself as a Premier League striker following an average spell at Liverpool, a poor two years at Aston Villa and a very brief loan spell at Portsmouth. Manchester United's Roy Keane slides in on Liverpool's Milan Baros during a Premier League game in 2005 as United's Darren Fletcher looks on . Milan Baros was the top scorer at Euro 2004 as he celebrates one of his five goals against Latvia . Czech Republic reached the semi-finals thanks to Baros' two goals in a 3-0 quarter-final win over Denmark . So it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at Euro 2004, scoring five goals as Czech Republic reached the semi-finals. David Healy (Northern Ireland - International caps 95, goals 36) Now David Healy wasn't a bad player, but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a European qualifying campaign \u00a0(13 for Euro 2008), you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the Premier League. Ashley Cole can only look on as David Healy fires home the winning goal for Northern Ireland in a famous 1-0 victory over England in a World Cup qualifier back in 2005 at Windsor Park . David Healy celebrates scoring for Fulham against Middlesbrough in 2007 before seeing the goal ruled out . But just five league goals for Fulham and Sunderland between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise. Still, Northern Ireland fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against England in 2005. Nicklas Bendtner (Denmark - International caps 65, goals 29) Much maligned during his Arsenal spell, and even loan spell at Sunderland and Juventus failed to land him permanent moves. Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner (right) and Chelsea's Michael Essien compete for the ball during a fourth round Capital One Cup match in 2013 at the Emirates Stadium . Nicklas Bendtner has a fine scoring record for Denmark, here he celebrates a Euro 2012 goal against Portugal . Even now at Wolfsburg, Bendtner can hardly get a kick. For Denmark though he is a totally different prospect. His hat-trick against USA on Wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at Arsenal in 43 fewer games. Helder Postiga (Portugal - International caps 71, goals 27) It seems incredible to think that a striker who couldn't even get into one of Tottenham's worst ever Premier League teams during the 2003-04 season is still mixing it with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo at the highest level.. Helder Postiga scored his only league goal for Tottenham against Liverpool in January 2004 . But Postiga would later haunt England after equalising against the Three Lions in a Euro 2004 quarter-final . Postiga scored just one league goal at Spurs, but he had the last laugh on England. Postiga scored for Portugal against the Three Lions in Euro 2004, while also featuring in the team that dumped out Sven Goran Eriksson's side at the World Cup two years later. Jozy Altidore (USA - International caps 79, goals 27) It was no surprise earlier in his career that not just Hull but Sunderland decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the Premier League. Jozy Altidore fends off Chelsea's David Luiz in a 2014 Capital One Cup quarter-final . Altidore (second right) celebrates scoring against Denmark in an international friendly on Wednesday . But just one league goal in 42 appearances for the Black Cats though soon had the North East outfit packing him off to Toronto in a swap deal for Jermain Defoe. Despite this, Altidore still holds his own in the starting XI of a respectable United States outfit. El Hadji Diouf (Senegal - International caps 69, goals 21) The star man of Senegal's 2002 World Cup campaign which helped him land African Footballer of the Year for the second year running after the tournament. El Hadji Diouf is sent off for Liverpool in a Premier League match at Chelsea as John Terry looks on in 2004 . Diouf celebrates after Senegal beat Sweden to progress to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals . So it was seen as quite a coup for Liverpool when they signed the forward for \u00a310m. Just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining Bolton, he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile Reds move. Danny Welbeck (England - International caps 32, goals 12) Frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at Manchester United, Danny Welbeck is finding a similar problem now at Arsenal in that he cannot get a start as a striker in front of Olivier Giroud. Danny Welbeck struck for Arsenal recently in their 2-1 win at Manchester United in the FA Cup . Welbeck's clever back-heel goal helped England beat Sweden 3-2 during the group stages at Euro 2012 . Welbeck has impressed when playing as a striker for England. Here he celebrates a goal against San Marino . Stick the 24-year-old in an England shirt though and he comes to life. His cheeky back heel against Sweden at Euro 2012 underlined his ability, and his recent addition to the side in partnering Wayne Rooney seems to have also improved the form of the England captain.",

        "article": "The knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear. For one mother though, the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother. In 2008, Franky Regan Lamb faced the news that her 21-year-old son Rakeim Regan had fatally stabbed her mother, Pat Regan,  in her own home, in Leeds. Scroll down for video . In a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, Franky Regan Lamb has spoken out about the horrifying incident in 2008 when her son, Rakeim Regan, murdered her mother Pat . Now in a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, which aired yesterday on the CI channel, Franky, her brother Shane and their friends have spoken out about the horrific incident which will haunt the family forever. Rakeim, who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis. His mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny - Pat's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene. Rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that Danny, a notorious drug dealer, might be a bad influence on him. Danny, who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm, was shot to death in 2002, following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs. Following her son's death Pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and, according to Franky, had a close relationship with Rakeim. Murdered Pat Regan (right) was an anti-gun campaigner, pictured here with fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside  Downing Street in 2008 . Slain uncle: Pat's son Danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs . She said: 'If he was in trouble, he'd go to my mum\u00a0probably\u00a0more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better. He was her grandson - they were just really close.' Despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about Rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence. His uncle Shane admitted: 'We had worries about him, because it seemed that he was impressed with, kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff. 'You know, there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just, kind of like, saying, \"You don't need to be focused on that kind of stuff. You need to focus more on your education, your music\" - you know, things that are quite playful, things that are positive. 'Don't look at the negative and don't be, you know, tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle.' Sadly, there was nothing the family could do to help him and as Rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs, his paranoia started to increase. Franky said: 'He kind of lost his way a little bit and I, kind of, guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years, in ecstasy, cocaine, and I used to say to Rakeim, \"You haven't got the mind-set to get through stuff like that, you know, take ecstasy and things like that. It's not good for you and it'll bring you down.\" 'He would go, \"I know mum, I don't do it any more.\"' Rakeim's uncle Shane Regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother. He says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother . Shane said: 'He was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles, aliens, he was having these kinds of thoughts. 'People's eye colours were changing, you know, to these luminous colours. He threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck. 'It was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be. He wanted to be a hard man, he wanted to be tough, he wanted to be fearless. 'He wanted to be this character that wasn't him and my mum was like, \"Well, I let him go out tonight, god knows what's going to happen to him.\"' Finally - following an incident in which Rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital. It was to prove too little, too late. The day after his release Pat, who had taken Rakeim in, went missing. She was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by Shane but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up. Shane was horrified when he was called to his mother's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding, only to find out that she had been killed. Shane was eventually called to come down to his mother's house, where he learned the devastating news that Pat had been stabbed to death. Franky said: 'I was hysterical. I would give anything, you know, to have my mum back. You know, to hear that call, I've had that call before about my brother, about my younger brother.' Worse news was to come when the family made the horrifying discovery that it was Rakeim behind the killing. However, Franky has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did. 'The realisation that your son's done what he's done, it's just gut-wrenching. I never felt, \"You horrible, horrible person.\" I never felt that. 'Part of me sometimes thinks, \"Would it be easier to dislike, not love Rakeim if he hadn't been a drug addict and he'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something, or he was just a nasty person? 'Because he wasn't, and it was the mental health, and he loved his grandma, and he wasn't a bad person, it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was.' Having pleaded guilty to manslaughter Rakeim is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and Franky goes to visit him on a regular basis. She said the first encounter was difficult: 'First seeing him, where he was, it was heartbreaking. I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d remember, and he remembered what he\u2019d done but he was still in a psychotic state. 'He was still delusional about what he\u2019d done and how he\u2019d done it, and to go and sit and listen to your son, your baby, saying this about what he\u2019s done to his grandma and your mum is the worst.' However, Shane has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again: 'Personally I\u2019ve not seen Rakeim since the day that he got sentenced. 'I just found it difficult to find a way to look in his eyes and speak to him about it. I dream about looking him in the eye, I have dreams of seeing him, I have this mixed emotion when I see him. 'I want to run up to him and give him a big hug and say, \u2018Do you know what, I love you,\u2019 and then I start to doubt that he did do it by accident.'",

        "article": "(CNN)In fairy tales, it's usually the princess that needs protecting. At Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the princess is the one defending the castle. Meet Parisa Tabriz, the 31-year-old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- \"Google Security Princess.\" Her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet, trying to find flaws in the system before the \"black hats\" do. Indeed, much like the good and bad witches of the Wizard of Oz, hackers are described as having \"white\" or \"black\" hats. To defeat Google's attackers, Tabriz must firstly think like them. In this cyberspace battle, the data of around a billion Chrome users hangs in the balance -- and Tabriz wasn't going to settle for any old moniker. \"When I started, my official job title was 'Information Security Engineer,' which I thought was a bit boring and not really meaningful,\" said the Iranian-Polish-American, speaking a million miles an hour over the phone from Google HQ. \"So I changed it to 'Security Princess' as more of a tongue-in-cheek thing. I've never been exceptionally girly or fit the stereotype of a princess, so it was a bit ironic for me to go by that name -- and then it stuck!\" Tabriz's role has evolved dramatically in the eight years since she first started working at Google. Back then, the young graduate from Illinois University was one of 50 security engineers -- today there are over 500. \"Our users include presidents of foreign countries -- I hope Obama uses Chrome too. It includes really highly-targeted individuals, political dissidents, journalists, and people who just want to casually use the internet,\" she said. \"Google depends on those users trusting us with their data. So if we can't protect it, we have no business.\" Cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched Nigerian Prince Scam to credit card theft, and suspected government surveillance over emails. Tabriz's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in Google's software, and sell the information to governments or criminals. To combat this, the company has set up a Vulnerability Rewards Program, paying anywhere from $100 to $20,000 for reported glitches. \"What we've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications,\" said Tabriz. \"In one case, there were Iranian-region Gmail users whose connection was being intercepted.\" \"These incidents are especially scary since they seem to be carried out by large, well-funded organizations or governments,\" she added. It's a world away from Tabriz's computer-free childhhod home in Chicago. The daughter of an Iranian-American doctor father, and Polish-American nurse mother, Tabriz had little contact with computers until she started studying engineering at college. Gaze across a line-up of Google security staff today and you'll find women like Tabriz are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes. She admits there's an obvious gender imbalance in Silicon Valley, but for once is stumped on the fault. \"Clearly the numbers make you think 'what is the problem that there aren't more women working in security, that there aren't more women working in technology?\" she said. \"And it does make me think what is the problem here? Is it the culture or the atmosphere?\" Funnily enough, during training sessions Tabriz first asks new recruits to hack not a computer, but a vending machine. \"There's this idea that you need to be a super genius computer geek to be a hacker. But in reality, I think anybody can be a hacker in the real world -- just think of all the non-software examples,\" said Tabriz. \"A lot of people ask me what's the best answer I've been given to the vending machine problem, and the real answer is there is none. Some people think about how they'd steal their favorite snack; some people figure out how to steal the entire machine of snacks; and some people figure out how they could add some sort of functionality to the machine that wasn't there before\" Tabriz's job is as much about technological know-how, as understanding the psychology of attackers. \"Anybody who's working in defense -- police officers, security, or law enforcement -- has to stop and think 'what is the enemy or the attacker going to do?'\" she said. \"Because you always want to stay one step ahead of them.\" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

        "article": "Unbeaten UFC champion Ronda Rousey's foray from the Octagon into action films has received rave reviews from Hollywood co-stars including Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. The UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion has followed up her appearance in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 with a butt-kicking role in the latest Fast and Furious installment. A behind-the-scenes preview shows the 28-year-old American trading some serious blows with actress Rodriguez in what producer Neal H Moritz described as 'one of the best fights we've ever had in the franchise'. Ronda Rousey (right) stars in a girl  fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez in Fast and Furious 7 . The UFC superstar has taken another Hollywood role after appearing in The Expendables 3 . Rousey admits she 'can't\u00a0wait to see the shock factor' following what's been described as one of the franchise's best ever fight scenes . The former Olympic Judo champion has be hailed by the producer and her co-stars . Rousey referred to the clash between the two women wearing expensive gowns in a penthouse suite as 'like a super oestrogen-pumped fight scene and I I can't wait to see the shock factor.' Her celebrity co-stars were equally impressed by the first US woman to win an Olympic gold medal in Judo, at the 2008 Beijing Games. 'I think the Ronda Rousey aspect is the game changer,' said Rodriguez - who finished filming the scene with a high-five congratulations following Rousey's knockout blow. Hollywood actress Rodriguez claims Rousey's appearance in the film is 'a game changer' Rodriguez and Rousey roll around on the floor during the celebrated fight scene . Leading man Vin Diesel claims he always knew Rousey would have 'a very special moment' 'I just love Ronda Rousey and I knew she was going to have a very special moment,' added leading man Diesel. Rousey currently boasts an 11-0 record in the sport having defeated Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in her most recent contest on February 28.

        "article": "World champion Lewis Hamilton is amused by Red Bull's complaints about Mercedes ongoing dominance, accusing the sport's preceding power of double standards. Mercedes are expected to dominate this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, just as it did at the season opener in Australia with a one-two finish, and the entire 2014 season. The huge edge Mercedes enjoys prompted calls for rule changes to make F1 racing closer, and after the Melbourne procession, Red Bull even floated the idea of withdrawing from the sport if the situation does not improve. Lewis Hamilton has accused Red Bull of double standards after their threat to leave Formula 1 . The Mercedes driver romped to victory at the Australian Grand Prix with Nico Rosberg in second . Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull were hugely successful before Mercedes' improvement in the last two years . 'I genuinely find it quite funny,' Hamilton said Thursday, noting that Red Bull saw no problem with the sport when it was dominating and Sebastian Vettel won four straight championships. 'It's an interesting opinion coming from individuals who had so much success. To already have comment after one race I find quite funny,' he said. Hamilton said Mercedes had simply done a better job than its rivals, who need to work harder to catch up rather than seek to change the rules. 'Not once did this team ever complain to others to equalise things,' Hamilton said. 'Now we are the best team, we pulled together and did an amazing job.' Hamilton walks in the paddock ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grnad Prix . Red Bull's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo chats to team principal Christian Horner in Kuala Lumpur . The re-introduction of mid-season engine upgrades this year does promise closer racing late in the year, but in the meantime Mercedes is expected to remain in a class of its own at the front of the field in Malaysia and beyond. However Hamilton was wary of Ferrari's performance during race-pace long runs in Melbourne, and saw the Italian team as the main threat. 'Definitely Ferrari have made a huge step and that is good to see,' Hamilton said. 'They put in some really spectacular sectors in the last race weekend.' Mercedes had cheekily invited Vettel to its Friday engineering briefing at Sepang after the German accepted an offer from Mercedes' Nico Rosberg made during the post-race media conference in Australia. However, Mercedes had since broadened the offer to any rival team to attend, and Ferrari said neither the team nor Vettel would be taking up the offer. Hamilton takes a selfie during a fan event in Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia on Wednesday . Hamilton says Ferrari will be close challengers this year and admits he has been impressed with their pace .",

Brook called out his British rival after stopping Jo Jo Dan in four rounds in the first defence of his IBF world title. But Khan has his eyes on bigger fish, despite promoter Eddie Hearn booking Wembley for June 13 should the Bolton man has a change of heart. Amir Khan (left) has rejected the chance to fight Kell Brook in June at Wembley because of Ramadan . Brook defended his IBF Welterweight title against Jo Jo Dan after knocking him down four times . He told fighthype:\u00a0'No one in America knows who Kell Brook is, whereas I can't walk the street without it getting crazy, everyone knows who Amir Khan is but it's a nice thing. 'June I can't do because of Ramadan, maybe that's why he's calling me out because he knows that I can't do June. Maybe the end of the year it could be done, I fight twice a year but that's because Ramadan falls right in the middle. 'I've seen his performance against Jo Jo Dan and he's going on like beating Jo Jo Dan is like beating a five-time World Champion. The Bolton-boxer didn't deny the fight could happen in the future but wants Brook to fight better opponents . The Sheffield fighter has been gunning for Khan for a number of years and feels he deserves a shot . 'He was fighting a b, c-class opponent, no disrespect to Jo Jo Dan but Kell is now a world champion and he needs to fight world class opponents, the likes of the [Keith] Thurman and you have big names in the welterweight decision but he's picking and choosing who he wants to fight.' Khan has made it clear he wants a big fight in America to really boost his profile and is targeting two of the biggest names in the sport to give him what he wants but refused to deny that the Brook won't happen sometime in the future. 'Whoever they put in front of him, he beats, so you can't really disrespect that but the fight between me and him won't happen until the end of the year or maybe next year. It's a fight I know that is going to happen but not just yet because I'm taking a different route. Khan is more focused on fighting the big names like Floyd Mayweather (right) and Manny Pacquiao . 'My route is to fight the big names like the Manny Pacquiao's and the [Floyd] Mayweather's and be amongst those names and also to fight in America and bring my name up over here. 'I just have to keep on doing what I do and keep putting on great performances for my fans. Whatever fights the fans want to see, I'll give it to them. 'The Thurmans and the Brook fights will happen so I'll never say no to any opponent - like the [Marcos] Maidana fight and I was one of the first guys to beat him and the first guy to put him down.",

Burundi-born England youth cap Bigirimana has yet to feature for the Light Blues after being diagnosed with a mystery illness. He was one of five Magpies youngsters signed by former Light Blues chief executive Derek Llambias without being put through a medical - even though Bigirimana knew he was sick before signing for the Glasgow giants. Gael Bigirimana has not played for Rangers since his loan move from Newcastle . The 21-year-old has denied rumours claiming he is suffering from Hepatitis-C, but Gers boss McCall confirmed his condition means he will not be able to feature for his adopted club. The former Motherwell manager would love to have the use of the former Coventry midfielder's services, but believes he should never have been allowed to make the move north in the first place. 'Bigi has got a medical condition which is a personal matter,' said McCall. 'The doctor and consultant are all involved in that. 'I knew him at Coventry. I remember watching him and thought when I came into the job he will be a good one to bring in and give us a bit of energy. Unfortunately because of his medical condition he won't be able to play for us. Bigirimana signed on loan for Rangers alongside Haris Vuckic (middle) and  Remie Streete . 'But that is as big a blow to the kid as it is for us. It's not his fault, this [row] has been nothing to do with him. He comes in with a smile on his face each morning, he trains with the fitness coach as hard as he possibly can. 'So as disappointed as we are that we can't use him, you have to think of the boy in this matter because he can't go back, he can't play for anyone else. 'It's an unfortunate circumstance that really should never have happened.' Llambias - a close associate of Magpies owner Mike Ashley - signed off on the five Newcastle loan deals just hours before the January transfer window shut, but did not ask club doctors to check the players over. So far only Slovenian playmaker Haris Vuckic has played regularly. Bigirimana says he knew he was ill before he moved to Rangers . Defender Remie Streete limped off just half an hour into his debut and has not been seen since, while Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson has yet to even step foot inside Murray Park after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury. Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu has featured for Rangers' youth side but is 'nowhere' near being fit enough for first-team duty, according to McCall. The Gers boss cans sympathise with the players but hit out at the previous regime's decision to sanction some of the signings. Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he feels sorry for Newcastle loanee  Bigirimana . McCall said: 'Should these guys ever have been sent here? Well, with Bigi being unable to play that's a no-brainer. With Shane, he was on his way back but had a little setback. 'But I think if you look at it in all honesty, anybody who comes up for a six-month loan should have a medical - obviously that is not the case. 'If that had occurred, two or three of the loans may not have happened. 'But none of the players are at fault here. Shane has not been up but the rest come in and train as hard as they can. They are doing their utmost to be involved.'",

Doting 19-year-olds Kate Wood and James Carter plan to spend the rest of their lives together after their eyes first locked over a badminton net in their freshers' week. Three months later, James got down on one knee, produced a diamond ring and proposed to Kate during a romantic getaway. Kate Wood and James Carter met at the University in East Anglia and got engaged three months later . James and Kate met whilst playing badminton during freshers' week . James proposed to Kate in January whilst the couple were on holiday in Istanbul, presenting her with this pretty diamond ring . The students at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, are to move out of their halls of residence and into a flat together. Politics student Kate told student newspaper The Tab\u00a0how they met on 3 October: 'We were playing badminton and we got talking and at first neither of us were really trying but then we got to talking more and we didn't really want to ever stop.' She added: 'When I got home I told all my flatmates that I had met someone really special. 'The next day we went down to the lake near campus and sat for about four hours doing nothing but talking. We went out together that night and it went perfectly.' The couple spent nearly every day together before they took a trip to Istanbul, where Kate is from, in January. It was there that computer science student James, from Berkshire, popped the question at 1am on 3 January - three months after they had met. Kate said yes and admitted she struggled to hold back the tears during the romantic moment. The couple clearly like to joke around with one another as Kate wore this T-shirt which reads 'Property of James' and includes arrows pointing to her breasts . James and Kate got engaged on the 5th of January and announced it on Facebook, pictured, but don't plan to marry until they graduate . The couple have announced their engagement on Facebook and admitted it did come as a surprise to their parents. Kate said: 'Our friends are not surprised and our parents are over the moon but at first they found it a bit weird but they knew straight away things were different between us.' She said they are not bothered about people who may criticise them for getting engaged so soon into their relationship as she says people can't judge them if they don't know them. She added that 'the ring and the engagement are symbolic of our commitment to each other' but they do not have any plans to actually tie the knot for the foreseeable future. They don't intend to marry until after they have both graduated and Kate said they have no plans to start a family till after then either.",

        "article": "Former Chelsea assistant manager Henk ten Cate has backed Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal to become a success at Old Trafford but insists his fellow countryman needs time. The Dutchman has been criticised throughout his first season in England for constantly tinkering with his side's set up and for failing to get the best out of high-profile players such as Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie. Manchester United, who crashed out of the FA Cup at home to Arsenal on Monday, face a tough battle to qualify for next season's Champions League as just two points now separate the Red Devils in fourth from fifth-placed Liverpool. Henk ten Cate believes Louis van Gaal is the man to help Manchester United get back to their glory days . Former Chelsea assistant manager Ten Cate (right), pictured with Avram Grant, heaped praise on Van Gaal . United are currently fourth in the Premier League . Ten Cate concedes Van Gaal's side have been below-par but is confident Van Gaal will be able to turn the club's fortunes around. 'I know him well and he is the kind of guy who doesn't just go for results, he wants his teams to play good football. He has proved that in the past,' Ten Cate told talkSPORT. 'Right now at Manchester United it is not that good. The way they are playing is absolutely not good. But it is not the style of Van Gaal. 'You have to give him time because, for me, he is one of the best coaches there is. I worked closely with him for one year when I was going through the stages to get my coaching licence. I saw what he was doing and the only thing he has to do is get used to the way of playing in England. 'If the owners of the club gave him that much confidence and that much money to spend, it is not a good thing to say goodbye after one season because it is starting to become his team. 'He needs a little more time but I am almost positive that he is going to surprise Britain with his [style of] football.'

        "article": "Pilot Jan Cocheret wrote at the beginning of the year about his fear of being locked out of the cockpit after visiting the aircraft's toilet . A Dutch pilot 'predicted' the Germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question: 'I seriously wonder who's sitting next to me.' Chillingly Jan Cocheret, who flies a Boeing 777 for Emirates airlines warned: 'I hope I never find myself in the situation where I go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that won't open.' Mr Cocheret was writing for Dutch flying magazine Piloot en Vliegtuig (Pilot and Plane) where he expressed his fears. His article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break. French prosecutors have determined that Andreas Lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit. He then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the Alps. Investigators revealed that the aircraft's captain Patrick Sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the Alps at more than 400 miles per hour. Audio leading up to the crash revealed that Captain Sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in Barcelona. As soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, Captain Sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit. As soon as the door closed behind him, Lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent. The door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated. Lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight-minute descent. Mr Cocheret later wrote on his Facebook page: 'Unfortuantely, this terrible scenario has become a reality.' Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before commanding the aircraft to crash into a mountain . Scientists are currently trying to identify the remains of the 150 people killed in the disaster using DNA . Investigators are currently trying to carve a road up to the crash site to help speed up the recovery process . His original article predicted the exact way such an atrocity could be carried out. He said: 'I seriously sometimes wonder who\u2019s sitting next to me in the cockpit. How can I be sure that I can trust him? Perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he\u2019s unable to overcome it. 'There indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit, but if the person inside disables this option (the security code to get in), one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens.' German airline Lufthansa has set aside $300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the Germanwings disaster. The French crash investigators BEA said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future. A spokesperson said: '(We will study) systemic weaknesses (that) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster.' German officials have revealed that Lubitz, 27, received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies. Crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box. Lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of Lubitz's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with Germanwings, its low-cost subsidiary.",

        "article": "Steve Smith hit a sublime century as Australia reached the World Cup final with an imposing 95-run victory over reigning champions India on Thursday. The 25-year-old hit 11 fours and two sixes as he made 105 as the co-hosts posted a daunting 328 \u00a0for 7, despite suffering a mid-over collapse. India\u2019s response never materialised and although MS Dhoni made a run-a-ball 65 Australia always looked in control with Mitchell Johnson (2-50) and James Faulkner (3-59) bowling India out for 233. Steve Smith celebrates after running out Indian batsman Ravindra Jadeja during the World Cup semi-final . Mitchell Johnson jumps for joy after taking the wicket of India's Rohit Sharma for 34 runs . Johnson is mobbed by his Australia team-mates after removing Indian dangerman Sharma . India pair MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja await a third umpire decision after Steve Smith direct hit . It was bad news for Jadeja as the third umpire ruled that he was out, sparking Australian celebrations . Steve Smith salutes the crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground after reaching his century . Smith whacks the ball for six runs during his innings of 105 from 122 balls as Australia set India 329 to win . Smith plays a shot during his impressive century that was the backbone of Australia's innings . In a sport dominated by statistics there were plenty that were pointing towards a home victory with India having beaten Australia just once in 13 previous meetings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. With the sub-continental side having continually suffered at the hands their opponents since arriving in the Southern Hemisphere in late November, Australia looked strong favourites. But Dhoni, India\u2019s exceptional if not a somewhat underrated leader, ensured the world champions rose to the occasion of defending their crown and the result of the semi-final was far from a foregone conclusion. Having won the toss, it came as no surprise that Michael Clarke chose to bat \u2013 opting to put runs on the board and attempt to apply pressure on India. The rejuvenated Indian pace attack began aggressively and the build-up of early pressure saw David Warner lose patience and send a leading edge off Umesh Yadav to Virat Kohli at cover. It brought Smith, India\u2019s kryptonite over the past four months, to the crease and he provided further evidence as to why many view him as the man to lead Australia in the near future. Despite the pressure of the situation Smith never looked fazed and having weathered an early storm of short-pitched deliveries he punished one Yadav over for four fours. Meanwhile, at the other end Aaron Finch was struggling to time the ball but Smith\u2019s ability to attack and keep the run-rate rising allowed his partner to find his feet. After becoming just the second Australian player, after David Boon, to score four successive World Cup half-centuries Smith finally made his maiden World Cup century. In the first over of the batting powerplay, the right-handed batsman hit three boundaries, the last a four pulled from outside off that saw him complete a 89-ball ton. The match seemed to be swerving dangerously out of reach for India with their bowlers continuing to offer short-pitched balls that were being dispatched to the stands. But, Dhoni brought back Yadav (4-72) and the eerily quiet SCG erupted as Smith attempted to hook a short ball and saw a top-edge fly to Rohit Sharma at deep square leg for 105 off 93-balls. Ravichandran Ashwin is clean bowled by Australia's James Faulkner for five runs . Mitchell Johnson celebrates with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin after combining to remove Virat Kohli . Shikhar Dhawan walks after being caught by Glenn Maxwell off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood for 45 . Mitchell Johnson celebrates with Michael Clarke after taking the wicket of Virat Kohli for one run . The Australian team look dismayed after a catch off Rohit Sharma was refereed to the third umpire . India celebrate after Umesh Yadav took the wicket of David Warner (left) for 12 run . As Smith walked off the SCG the Indian fans were relieved to see the back of the outstanding batsman, who has plundered 921 runs in 10 innings this summer against them. Having broken the 187-run second-wicket partnership India looked to go on the attack but all-rounder Glenn Maxwell was equal to task, hitting three fours and a six in a quick-fire 23. As Maxwell departed Australia were faltering and Finch, who had grafted his way to 81, was the next to go - caught at mid-wicket by Shihkar Dhawan - having become increasingly frustrated at a succession of dot balls. Captain Clarke (10) quickly followed him back to the hutch with Mohit Sharma claiming his first wicket as India slowly began to claw the match back to an even keel. Though Smith, Finch and Clarke were all dismissed by the short ball, the Indian bowlers were guilty of relying on it far too much and Shane Watson and Faulkner cashed in late on to push Australia past 300. A cameo from Johnson (27 not out) took the co-hosts to 328-7 as India conceded 89 in the final 10 overs. If India were going to finally win their first match in Australia this summer they needed to get off to quick start. Rohit was lucky not to be dismissed for a duck in the first over off Mitchell Starc as he drove a fuller ball to Watson at slip only for it to be adjudged to have just fallen short. Steve Smith watches as the ball runs away during his important innings of 105 . Umesh Yadav (left) and Suresh Raina celebrate after taking the wicket of Australia's David Warner . Fellow opener Dhawan then enjoyed his own bit of luck as he danced down the track to Josh Hazlewood but wicketkeeper Brad Haddin dropped a big outside edge. The second lives for both batsmen was gleefully accepted and the pair put on a 76-run first-wicket partnership as India looked to make inroads into the substantial target. But Hazlewood soon had his man as Dhawan (45) looked to have timed his shot perfectly only to pick out Maxwell at deep extra cover. It was a desperately required wicket for Australia and three overs later India\u2019s star batsman Kohli was dismissed by Johnson for just a single. The 26-year-old has scored 13 centuries in victorious chases for his country but failed to add to that in Sydney, as he top-edged a bouncer high into the sky and straight into Haddin\u2019s gloves. Knockout matches bring about a unique pressure and the impressive Indian batting line-up collapsed from 76 without loss to 91 for three. as Rohit was bowled - via an inside edge - by Johnson for 34. In their previous seven matches in the World Cup, at least one of India\u2019s top-five batsmen have scored a half-century or a hundred to anchor their side\u2019s innings. But as Suresh Raina departed for an 11 ball seven and India were wavering on 108 for four, the task of taking India to victory again rested on the shoulders of Dhoni.

Ajinkya Rahane shared an important 70-run fifth-wicket partnership with his captain before Starc has him caught behind off the slightest of edges on review. Smith continued to affect the outcome of the match and with the required run-rate rapidly rising, reaching over 13 with 10 overs left, as he ran-out Ravindra Jadeja for 16. On 40 occasions in which the 33-year-old has finished unbeaten when his side was chasing, Dhoni has taken them to triumph 38 times. Having prodded his way to 47 off 54 balls, the Indian captain smashed the recalled Watson for successive sixes. Paceman Mohit Sharma (left) celebrates after taking the wicket of Michael Clarke . Australian fans enter into the spirit of the occasion at the Sydney Cricket Ground . India were also very well supported at the SCG as they continued the defence of their title . But Dhoni\u2019s innings was eventually ended as Maxwell, with one stump to aim at, ran the Indian captain out 65. India had not lost more then seven wickets in their previous seven World Cup matches and the previously unexposed tail were quickly dismissed. Faulkner bowled Ravichandran Ashwin (5) and Shami (0) in successive balls before Starc wrapped up the innings, bowling Yadav for a five-ball duck, with 19 balls spare. Australia have now won all seven semi-finals they have featured in and the impressive victory has set-up a mouth-watering final against the unbeaten New Zealand in Melbourne on Sunday.",

        "article": "Birmingham Bears have pulled off a major coup for the NatWest T20 Blast with the signing of New Zealand's powerhouse captain Brendon McCullum. The reigning champions will be able to call on the services of the explosive 33-year-old batsman for their final seven matches of this year's competition. McCullum will link up with the Bears once New Zealand's tour of England has been concluded and his first game is scheduled to be against Lancashire Lightning on June 26 at Old Trafford. New Zealand's powerhouse captain Brendon McCullum has signed for Birmingham Bears for the T20 Blast . McCullum will link up with the Birmingham Bears once New Zealand's tour of England has been concluded . He will arrive on these shores with a fearsome reputation after playing a starring role at the top of the order in the Black Caps' run to the World Cup final. Among his four half-centuries in nine matches for the co-hosts was a destructive 77 off just 25 balls against England in Wellington. Dougie Brown, Birmingham Bears director of cricket, said: 'Brendon's dynamic performances in the ICC Cricket World Cup have demonstrated once again exactly why he is one of the most feared batsmen in the game. 'Securing his availability for our last seven games has to make him one of the biggest overseas player signings in the competition's history. 'His power at the top of the order and experience of playing in big matches are great assets to bolster our already strong squad as we look to win through to the quarter-finals and defend our NatWest T20 Blast title.' He arrives with a fearsome reputation after playing starring role during New Zealand's run to World Cup final . McCullum is the leading run scorer in the history of T20 internationals, with 2,105 at an average over 35, with two centuries. He said: 'The Birmingham Bears had a great season last year, including winning the NatWest T20 Blast, and hopefully I can make a big contribution and ensure that we can progress in the tournament. 'Edgbaston is a fantastic ground to play at and hopefully it will be rocking for the big Friday night matches. I'm really excited about becoming a Bear and the challenge ahead.' Elsewhere, Leicestershire have signed Ireland\u2019s big-hitting all-rounder Kevin O\u2019Brien for the T20 Blast but Lancashire\u2019s plans for the new season have been rocked by seamer Peter Siddle\u2019s inclusion in Australia\u2019s Test squad.",

        "article": "Sao Paulo, Brazil  (CNN)Demonstrators took to the streets across Brazil on Sunday, protesting corruption and demanding the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Her administration is struggling amid a weak economy and a massive corruption scandal involving the country's state-run oil company. \"I love Brazil. I love my country. And I am tired of corruption. We are tired of corruption. It doesn't matter which political party you are from, we are tired of being robbed,\" a protester told CNN in Sao Paulo, where people packed the main Paulista Avenue. In Rio de Janeiro, they gathered along Copacabana beach, while in the capital, Brasilia, protesters marched on government headquarters. The mood was festive. Many demonstrators wore the country's colors -- green, blue and yellow -- waved flags, and chanted: \"Out Dilma.\" Amid complaints about the economy, protesters say they are incensed because Brazilian investigators are unraveling a huge money-laundering and bribery case centered around Petrobras, the country's national oil company. Dozens of politicians, some in Rousseff's party, are accused of accepting millions in payments. The President has not been implicated in the investigation, but she was the Energy Minister and chairwoman of Petrobras during much of the time that the alleged corruption took place. Why are protesters furious with Brazil's President? Sunday night Rousseff sent two of her ministers to address the nation at a televised press conference. The justice minister and the general secretary said that the government was listening and would announce changes in several days designed to combat corruption. The announcement did little to quiet the protests in some cities. Many protesters banged pots and pans and honked car horns. CNN iReporter Bruno Teles with Avant Drones shot aerial footage of the crowds in Sao Paulo. He said, \"Brazilians are tired of such corruption, lies and [the] bad economy.\" Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She won re-election in October, in one of the tightest races in recent years, but has since seen her approval rate plummet along with the economy. Brazil is headed into recession again this year, inflation is up and the currency is at a 12-year low. Rousseff's approval rating down to 23% from 42% at the end of 2014, according to DataFolha. The economy is expected to contract this year and the real has plummeted 23% against the dollar. Barbara Arvanitidis reported from Sao Paulo. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Patrick Gillespie and Shasta Darlington also contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Millions of patients are struggling to see their GP as surgeries are not open at a convenient time. Nearly one in five said they cannot easily make the appointments offered \u2013 despite promises that family doctors would extend their hours to evenings and weekends. The number of patients who are 'fairly or very dissatisfied' with the opening hours at their surgery has risen by two million, or some 43 per cent, in the past three years alone, jumping from 3.7million in 2012 to 5.3million, the latest GP Patient Survey found. The number of patients who are 'fairly or very dissatisfied' with the opening hours at their surgery has risen by two million in the past three years alone, jumping from 3.7million in 2012 to 5.3million (file picture, posed) And a quarter of patients are now waiting more than a week to see their GP. Labour, which obtained the data, said it shows the failure of the Conservatives to deliver on their promise to introduce a seven-day-a-week service. They said that this is piling pressure on emergency departments as patients who cannot get a GP appointment decide to go to A&E instead. David Cameron promised in his party's manifesto at the last election in 2010: 'We will ensure that every patient can access a GP in their area between 8am and 8pm, seven days a week'. But a survey by the Daily Mail last year revealed millions of patients wait three weeks to see their GP, and only one in three now manages to secure a same-day appointment. GPs have spoken out about their struggle to meet demand. Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said last week: 'GPs are facing unprecedented pressures in trying to care for increasing numbers of patients with increasingly limited resources. 'We believe that the way to best improve patient care and keep the NHS sustainable is to invest properly in general practice and to ensure that we have enough GPs to cope with the demand of our growing and ageing population.' She has previously warned that 'we do worry on patient safety grounds that access is becoming more of a problem', as the delays to seeing patients can lead to late diagnoses of deadly illnesses such as cancer. Labour said the figures show the failure of the Conservatives to deliver on their promise to introduce a seven-day-a-week service. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (pictured) said it is 'on David Cameron's watch' The Labour party says it will open 8,000 more GP surgeries and extend surgeries' opening hours if it wins office. But critics accused Labour of botching negotiations of the GP contract in 2004, causing a drop in out-of-hours cover from GPs and forcing patients to attend crowded A&Es instead. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say today: 'One of Cameron's first acts as Prime Minister was to scrap Labour's guarantee of an appointment within 48 hours and our extended opening scheme. 'On his watch, millions more patients are unhappy with their surgery opening hours.' A Conservative health spokesman said:\u00a0'The vast majority of patients can get an appointment and are satisfied with their GP \u2013 and the next Conservative Government would go further and give everyone 7-day access to a GP from 8am-8pm. We've already made it easier for millions of busy people to see their GP at a time that best suits them, with more evening and weekend appointments.'",

        "article": "The battery of an underwater locator beacon had run out more than a year before flight MH370 disappeared, a report by investigators revealed today. The update on the progress of the probe surrounding the Malaysia Airlines plane - which vanished a year ago today - indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it. The plane, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014 - and a huge search in the Indian Ocean has so far proved fruitless. One year on: Family members of passengers missing on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 shout at police officers who tried to move journalists away from a protest near the Malaysian embassy in Beijing today . Emotional: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 weeps outside the main gate of the Lama Temple  in Beijing today . Sadness: A relative of MH370 passengers holds a sign reading 'Dad I miss U!' outside the Lama Temple today . Family: There were 239 people on board the flight when it disappeared  en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . Relatives of MH370 victims: (Clockwise from top left)  Li Jiuying holds a picture of her brother Li Guohai;  Jacquita Gonzales holds a portrait of her husband,  in-flight supervisor Patrick Gomes; Liu Kun displays a photo of his brother Liu Qiang; and Chinese woman Dai Shuqin, who lost five members of her family . Apart from the anomaly of the beacon, the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation's biggest mysteries. The significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent, except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane, even if they were in its vicinity. The report said: \u2018The sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents, and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability.\u2019 Whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the Flight Data Recorder, the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working. Standing together: Relatives of MH370 passengers attend an event today marking the one-year anniversary of its disappearance in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Calling for their return: The brother of a missing passenger writes a message during the Kuala Lumpur event . Memories: Two Chinese people hold a picture of their son, an MH370 passenger, during the event in Malaysia . Remembered: Jie Yie, four, holds a picture of her grandmother Lee Sew Chu and her aunt Ng May Li who were aboard MH370, in Kuala Lumpur today . Ordeal: A Chinese relative of a missing passenger on  MH370 cries as she sits on the curb outside the Malaysia Embassy  in Beijing . The two instruments are critical in any crash because they record cockpit conversation and flight data, leading up to the end of the flight. Relatives of passengers and crew today marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing, under a heavy police presence. Chinese relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the Boeing 777 at a number of sites in Beijing, including the Malaysian embassy, the airport and the Lama Temple, a popular Tibetan Buddhist place of worship and tourist site. Dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission, while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force. The big question: Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik creates a sand sculpture of MH370 on Puri beach in Odisha, India . Writing: A family member of MH370 pens a message on a balloon during a memorial event  in Kuala Lumpur . Tears: Wang Guohui (right), mother of MH370 passenger Li Zhi, cries next to another passenger's relative . Sign: Catherine Gang, whose husband Li Zhi was on the plane, holds a banner outside Lama Temple today . About 30 visited the Lama Temple, with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects, as if attempting to keep a low profile. Flight Captain: Zaharie Ahmad Shah . The physical and mental well-being of Flight Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was examined by the report, which said he had no known history of apathy, anxiety or irritability. \u2018There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses,\u2019 it said. It also said there were \u2018no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse\u2019 by the captain, his first officer and the cabin crew. Financial checks also showed nothing abnormal about their gross monthly income and spending pattern. It said the captain held several bank accounts and two national trust funds. He had two houses and three vehicles, but there was no record of him having a life insurance policy. Co-pilot: First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid . The co-pilot, First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, had two saving accounts and a national trust fund account. He owned two cars and \u2018spent money on the upkeep\u2019 of these vehicles. \u2018He does not have much savings in his bank account. He has a life insurance policy,\u2019 it said. The remainder waited outside the temple in a group, wearing T-shirts saying \u2018Pray for MH370\u2019, and waving placards to photographers reading \u2018Keep searching for MH370\u2019. Meanwhile, Voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a \u2018Day of Remembrance\u2019 at a shopping centre in Kuala Lumpur with songs, poems and prayers. Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said: \u2018It is important to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search.\u2019 The Malaysian prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found. Najib Razak said: \u2018The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear. \u2018Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found.\u2019 While the country's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident, and said all those on board are presumed dead, relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers. Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide-ranging search. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his government would provide \u2018all needed service to every next of kin\u2019 and help uphold their \u2018legitimate and lawful rights and interests\u2019. Most of the plane's passengers were Chinese. \u2018A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue,\u2019 Mr Wang told a news conference in Beijing. \u2018Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin. Our hearts are with you.\u2019 The report by an independent investigation group went into minute details of the crew's lives, including their medical and financial records and their training. It also examined the aircraft's service record, as well as the maintenance schedule, weather, communications systems and other aspects. No way though: A journalist (right) is blocked by Chinese police outside Lama Temple after prayers in Beijing . A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 shows a poster saying 'Bring the MH370 passengers home' Moving away: Chinese police block journalists with cameras filming relatives of MH370 passengers in Beijing . Talking: A relative of a Chinese passenger from MH370 speaks to the foreign media outside the Lama Temple . These showed nothing unusual except for the one previously undisclosed fact of the battery's expiry date. It said that according to maintenance records, the battery on the beacon attached to the Flight Data Recorder expired in December 2012. \u2018There is some extra margin in the design to account for battery life variabilty and ensure that the unit will meet the minimum requirement,\u2019 it said. \u2018However, once beyond the expiry date, the (battery's) effectiveness decreases so it may operate, for a reduced time period until it finally discharges,\u2019 the report said.

But she found the situation was completely different in the U.S. where women were more open about their desire for casual sex and their willingness to hire an escort to satisfy their needs. One of the women Jodie met for her TLC show, Jodie Marsh On Women Who Pay For Sex, which airs this evening, is\u00a0Cyndi, 46, from Miami. Scroll down video . Cyndi, 46, from Miami, hit it off with male escort Dom who she hired to go on a date with her . She told Jodie that she was willing to pay $2,500 (\u00a31,700) for a date with her 'dream man' following the end of her 15-year marriage. The mother said: 'I am finding men my age haven't taken care of themselves that well, I like younger men.' On why she chose to hire a younger man to date rather than seek to meet someone on a dating site or through friends, Cyndi admitted it was because she just wanted to have fun and keep things casual. She said: 'I want to get out of the daily grind of my life.\u00a0It's hard for women to admit we don't want strings either, we feel an obligation to want more from it. 'It's hard to admit to your friends you just want casual sex and a really fun night and not have anything more come of it.' Jodie, right, meets the pair who revealed their date led to a one night stand . Cyndi hired male escort Dom, a father in a long-term relationship, to go on a date with her to a yoga class followed by drinks and dinner. But Jodie discovered they clicked so well, they stayed the night at a hotel where they had sex. Male escorts legally\u00a0can't advertise sex for money and websites are carefully worded so women know they are not buying sex but companionship. However, as Cyndi discovered, 'extras' are often on offer if both parties are agreeable. Appearing on today's This Morning with Jodie, Cyndi told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that sex wasn't top of her agenda when she first hired Dom, a 6ft 3 ex-marine. She explained: 'Hiring a male escort was something I was curious about after getting divorced. It served my needs without getting serious. I thought of it as a fun adventure. 'I had an open mind but didn't think it would definitely lead to sex. I thought it would be good experience and chance to hang out with good looking man who paid attention to me. Cyndi appeared on This Morning today via video link as Amanda Holden, left, asked her why she hired a male escort and Jodie, right, revealed they couldn't get a British woman to admit the same . 'Dominic he said he thought I was beautiful and was happy I was there. I suppose he was paid to say that but it felt really genuine.' After spending the night with Dom - whose girlfriend condones his employment - Cyndi told Jodie she would hire him again and would recommend other women do the same if they want a pleasurable night with no strings attached. Jodie told Phillip and Amanda she was concerned about how Cyndi would emotionally handle the one night stand she paid for. She said: 'She definitely had a real connection with him and I was worried she could fall for him as they clicked so much and had such a great time.' Jodie, 36, is currently celibate and said on today's This Morning she would hire a male escort to join her at a party rather than attending as 'an older single woman on my own' But Cyndi insisted on This Morning that she knew what she had signed up for. 'In this experience I could separate my emotions as I knew what I was involved with, it was what it was,' she said. 'We are humans and I thought he was adorable and sweet and we had a physical connection and chemistry but I wasn't going to let my heart get involved. 'I wasn't hiring him to fall in love and have kids with him. I would do it again and absolutely recommend other women do it if the situation is right and you are emotionally in control of your feelings.' Jodie, 36, agreed that she would also hire a male escort to accompany her on dates - but as she's been celibate for the past four years there would be nothing sexual involved. Jodie had to travel to America to interview women who have paid for sex with male escorts as none in Britain were willing to be open about it . On Jodie's TLC show, she also meets male strippers, pictured, as well as gigolos and the women who are forgoing dating and relationships for an evening with a professional lover . She said: 'I have hired an escort before and I would use one again if I was going to a party rather being an older single woman on my own. 'Women feel threatened by other single women so if you are there with a fella people don't see you as a threat.' The TV presenter, who has also had success as a body builder, said she wasn't surprised she had to travel to America to research her latest documentary after finding nobody in Britain willing to admit they hire male escorts. She said: 'Not a single woman admitted to using them! We met so many of British male escorts and they really love their job. 'British people are not just reserved, they just do not want to speak openly about anything.' Jodie Marsh On Women Who Pay For Sex is on TLC tonight at 10pm .",

        "article": "A boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new  trial. Jordan Brown, now 17, was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in February 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room. The court heard Houk, then eight months pregnant, was sleeping when Brown approached her with a blanket-covered 20-gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head. However, Brown's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement. 'Rush judgement': Jordan Brown (pictured left aged 14), was convicted of shooting his father's fiancee Keznie Houk (right) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping. He claims the evidence was insubstantial . Shock: His father Chris Brown (pictured) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11 . Filing for retrial on Thursday, defense attorney Steve Colafella said: 'I think the trial court has, at a minimum, no choice but to give us a new trial. 'We feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal.' The state Supreme Court first raised questions about the case in December. Jordan Brown's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling. State prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in Lawrence County. State police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but Brown, who is now 17. The defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy, fueled in part by Houk's family. They have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who, they contend, was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse in Wampum, about 40 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Tragic: Houk left behind a seven-year-old Jenessa (left) and a four-year-old Adalynn (right) Brown's defense lawyers claim Houk's family fueled animosity towards Brown during the 2012 trial . Brown's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement . Prosecutors contend Brown approached Houk with his youth-model 20-gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed. She was more than 8 months pregnant with a son, who also died. Brown's father had left for work and Houk's two daughters, ages 7 and 4, were the only others in the house when she was shot, prosecutors said. An empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road, where Brown walked before a school bus picked him up that morning, and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for Brown's. But Colafella said pictures from the scene show a 'muddy mess' outside the house that doesn't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in. 'Jealousy': Jordan was allegedly jealous that his father's new son was going to be named Chris after him . The defense also said Brown frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier. Police have said Houk's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation, but the Supreme Court noted defense arguments that Jordan saw a truck resembling the man's near the house that morning. Colafella also said Houk's seven-year-old daughter first told police she didn't hear anything unusual that morning, only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning. Houk's body was found after the four-year-old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead, police said. Jack Houk, the dead woman's father, did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing. The defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse .",

        "article": "If you want to impress a man, don't try to be funny. Research shows that men aren't hugely attracted to witty women. Given the choice of a female who makes him laugh, or one that laughs at his jokes, he will choose the latter. Luckily, women aren't too worried about their jokes being appreciated. They, it seems, like men who make them smile. Men prefer it if a woman laughs at their jokes, rather than witty women research suggests (stock image) It is thought that women see the ability to make people laugh sign of intelligence \u2013 and men have evolved to show off how good they are with words. The University of Miami researchers quizzed more than 80 men and women about how much importance they placed on having a partner who could make them laugh. They were also asked how much it mattered to them whether their partner found them funny. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour. In a second experiment, the volunteers were given hypothetical amounts of money to 'spend' on designing their ideal partner. They were asked how much of the cash they'd be willing to spend on getting someone who made them laugh and how much they'd devote to getting someone who laughed at their jokes. As the amount of 'money' on offer rose, the sexes became less rigid in their choices, with the males starting to splash the cash on funny females the women showing more interest in males who found them witty. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour (stock image) Researcher Liana Hone said this suggests that in an ideal world, we value both traits in a partner. However, in the real world, we tend to place more emphasis on one or the other. She believes that women see the ability to make people laugh as a sign of intelligence \u2013 and of the sort of high quality genes that she'd want in her children. Given that women tend to be more choosy, men are under pressure to make them laugh. Miss Hone, who is close to completing her PhD, said: 'Given that humour requires high-level linguistic capacity, women are thought to use humour production as a sign that a man is a mentally-capable suitor.' However, she said that funny women shouldn't despair. There is also hope for bachelors who never remember punch lines. This is because her results were based on averages \u2013 and not everyone will have the same taste.",

Police in Memphis have identified 25 rape suspects after finally testing evidence kits that had been forgotten about for 40 years. Some rape victims have sued the city, alleging that the failure to test around 12,000 kits, some dating back to the 1970s, has allowed too many rapists to escape prosecution. The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match. Now it has been revealed that the backlog, which is now being cleared, has identified 25 suspected rapists with 16 of them believed to have assaulted multiple victims. Memphis Police Lieutenant Cody Wilkerson also confirmed that 5,386 kits had now been sent for testing and that 58 cases have been sent to prosecutors for indictment. However, he added dozens of investigations have been cut short because of statutes of limitations on rape charges, or the deaths of victims or suspects. It comes after it emerged last month that accused rapist Charles Baker, who allegedly assaulted a woman at gunpoint, had finally been arrested after a backlogged rape kit was tested. Baker, 44, was charged with aggravated rape after the attack in Memphis 15 years ago. He is accused to have abducted the victim at gunpoint in 2000 in downtown Memphis and raped her. The woman then consented to a rape kit test but the evidence wasn't tested by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation until July 2012. It was then revealed that the DNA then matched that of Baker earlier this year. In a report about the kit testing backlog last year, former U.S. Attorney Veronica Coleman-Davis said nobody maliciously or wantonly allowed the kits to remain untested. Instead she attributed the problem to 'a general and collective failure to understand the importance of DNA testing as was reflected in common practices in place locally and nationwide.' The kits contain samples of semen, saliva and blood taken from a victim, with the DNA then uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System to check for a match . Meanwhile in February, officials in Houston said evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested there for years has turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles. And in Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009. In Cleveland, prosecutors have also sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.",

Joanne O'Connor said she discovered the bizarre scene after she returned home early from work one day last year. Her husband John Young, a radio DJ, then assaulted her and grabbed her hair, and has now been fined \u00a3300 for the attack. Row: John Young fought his wife after she found a naked 18-year-old man tied up in the family home . Ms O'Connor, 48, told Kilmarnock Sheriff Court: 'I knew our marriage was in trouble when I found an 18-year-old boy naked and bound in the living room.' The court heard that Young, 49, then smashed up his own collection of CDs during the ensuing row in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, the Evening Times reported. An antique clock which was a family heirloom was also damaged in the fight. The couple's daughter went into the room and said: 'What are you arguing about now?' Young denied assaulting and injuring his wife by grabbing her hair and chest. Fined: Young was convicted of assault after a trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, pictured, and fined \u00a3300 . He told the court that he has since come out as gay, but claimed that Ms O'Connor accused him of being a paedophile. The DJ said that if he had attacked his wife she would have hit him back. Sheriff Brian Murphy found Young guilty of assault, and ordered him to pay a \u00a3300 fine. He could also lose his new job with North Ayrshire Council. Young, who uses the professional name Ian Young, helped to set up Irvine Beat FM, but has now left the station.",

If you can stretch the budget a little more, this could be the stand-out budget pick of the bunch in Brighton, Tasmania. The Magnolia Court property is a two-storey house with four bedrooms, three upstairs and the master downstairs with a two way bathroom and an extra bathroom upstairs for the kids. Scroll down for video . The Magnolia Court property in Brighton, Tasmania, is on the market for only\u00a0$299,000 . The\u00a0two-storey house features four bedrooms, three upstairs and the master downstairs with a two way bathroom and an extra bathroom upstairs for the kids . Belle Parker of Roberts Real Estate in Glenorchy said the reason behind the bargain price was that the owners were desperate to sell . 'This young couple bought it for a family member to rent and that hasn't worked out - they are going to lose money on it but they just have had enough of it and have to sell,' she said . 'The kitchen has ample storage, there's a breakfast bar, pantry, floating timber floor and opens up to the dining room area that leads out through a sliding door to the rear yard,' she added . And the reason why such a gorgeous home is up for grabs for offers - even though it's listed at the $290,000 mark. 'The owner wants it sold,' said Belle Parker of Roberts Real Estate in Glenorchy. 'It's an absolute ripper and yes they are very open to offers, I know people can get a bit cheeky when you say that, but there's a real chance to get it even cheaper.'

        "article": "Samantha Cameron and her two older children, Nancy, 11, and Elwen, 9, were in the gallery just beside me for PMQs \u2013 and they chose a belter. 'There's going to be quite a lot of shouting,' I heard Mrs Cameron warn the youngsters as the House assembled below us. There sure was. This was the last PMQs of the Parliament. For either Dave or Ed, this was possibly the last hurrah at the despatch box. As the Prime Minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children. An enormous beam lit his face and he winked at them. But as he read his usual opening spiel about having 'further such meetings today' he shot the Speaker a rueful little smile, plainly acknowledging that the precious formula of words \u2013 used by premiers for decades \u2013 might never again fall from his lips. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband was left flustered after Mr Cameron was happy to rule out a VAT increase during the PMQs . After that momentary wobble, Mr Cameron proceeded to do to Ed Miliband what your average food processor will do to a bunch of browning bananas. Magimix time! Mr Miliband had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival. The Labour leader stood at the Table, feet planted wide, a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone. After a drollery about Mr Cameron's 'retirement plans' (that TV interview which has so excited the PM's more crosspatch critics), Ed Mil' challenged the PM to give a straight answer to a straight question. 'Will he now rule out a rise in VAT?' asked Mr Miliband. Mr Cameron: 'Yes.' Oops! That wasn't meant to happen. Mr Miliband had been expecting the PM to give a waffling non-answer. All his poise had been predicated on that. The eyebrow had been raised in a doubting manner as he put the query. His tone had been sarcastic. He knew \u2013 just knew \u2013 that Cameron would not be able to give a straight answer. Instead, the low swine had coughed up a horribly direct, undeniable, comprehensible 'yes'. What a filthy trick. Not fair, ref! The Miliband team had spent hours finessing follow-up attack lines. They had envisaged accusing the Tories of failing to be clear about their VAT plans. Now the so-and-so Cameron had gone and ruled out any such rise. Darn Tories. You can't rely on them to do ANYTHING. From my perch I could not see Mr Miliband's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit-machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank. His cheeks were sucked in, as were the curtains in Dorothy's bedroom as the tornado strikes in The Wizard of Oz. The whole House was taken by similar surprise. There was an initial silence, as perhaps happens immediately after a bomb blast before car alarms start to ring. Had one of Labour's main themes for the general election just been obliterated? It did look horribly like that. Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . Er ,er, er, er: the Miliband mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze. He sounded as though he had just swallowed a Rubik's Cube whole. 'Let me say to him, let me say to him, let me say to him,' he jibbered, gulping for air. Then, with desperation: 'Nobody's gonna believe him! Nobody's gonna believe him!' This drew laughter from the Government benches, aghast silence from Labour. Lucy Powell, Labour election supremo, was sitting beside Mr Miliband. She was doing one of those tombstone grins they do in the Tom & Jerry cartoons before all the teeth drop out. Mr Cameron capitalised on the ambush (which, one hears, may have been arranged with George Osborne). He pounced on Labour confusion and asked Mr Miliband if he would reciprocate by ruling out a Labour tax rise on national insurance. Naughty. After all, PMS is meant to be about questions TO the prime minister, not from him. Speaker Bercow let it pass and Mr Miliband flailed. He offered no such promise on national insurance, allowing Mr Cameron to clinch the moment by accusing Labour of a 'jobs tax bombshell'. Only later in the afternoon did a somewhat panicked Labour high command deny that it will hike national insurance tax. By then the moment had largely passed. Mr Cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the Despatch Box, with\u00a0wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen looking on from the public gallery . The Government benches were in loud, rampant tumult. Sir Bob Russell (Lib Dem, Colchester) hoiked up his trouser legs to betray two horrendously yellow socks (he had a yellow waistcoat, too). Keith Simpson (Con, Broadlands) waved a large, florid mouchoir. Beside me, young Nancy and Elwen grinned enormously and Nancy clenched her fist, punching the air with a 'Yes!'. She is like this aged 11? Crumbs. By 30 she'll probably be running a multinational. Or the country. Behind the Cameron family party sat another notable visitor: Geoffrey Boycott, cricket commentator and Yorkshireman. Boycs kept his counsel but if he had been offering commentary box analysis of the session one fears he might have talked of Miliband's stoomps bein' uprooted. This was a comprehensive clattering of a disorientated, dazed Miliband. It was a high-velocity whizzing which left the Labour leader a sorry, smoothiefied splodge on the floor. Game on.",

        "article": "Saudi Arabia and its neighboring Middle Eastern countries are notorious for censoring 'sexual' album covers by female artists in order to make the artwork more appropriate for a conservative audience. Record companies hoping to sell their artists's albums are ever-more sensitive to the beliefs and cultural traditions of each market they're selling to, and will often tailor album covers in order to avoid offence. In some extreme cases there have been reports of the Saudi government paying religious police members of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) to manually alter from covers. Scroll down for video . Who wore it best? Madonna's 2008 album was censored with many agreeing the second verison was actually better . Cover up: Countries including Lebanon increased the dimension of the ball in front of her in order to cover her breasts. They\u2019ve also colored her legs black in order to give the impression that she\u2019s covered up . Going ga-ga: Lady Gaga's behind was fully clothed when the album was released in the Middle East . The altered covers are found on music download sites such as iTunes as well as in regular stores. It has been reported in the past that police officers have unwrapped CD cases, removed the front and back inserts and carefully and painstakingly colored in with marker pen any photos baring exposed female flesh that is deemed objectionable. Some Islamic scholars specify which areas of the body must be covered; while others require all but the eyes to be covered, using garments. Most mainstream scholars say that men, in contrast, should only cover themselves from the navel to the knees . The CPVP is a government agency that employs religious police, called Muttawa, to make sure that citizens adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam, especially those pertaining to dress, socialization, morality and prayer. The commission comprises approximately 10,000 Muttawa and has nearly 500 centers within the country. However, while police officers operating within the Middle East are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to make sure any album artwork is appropriate, it is actually far easier for record companies to simply produce separate versions of well-known covers. On cloud nine: Katy Perry is seen floating on a cloud on her main album cover, but is completely swaddled in the picture for her Middle Eastern Teenage Dream front cover (right) Dreamy: Looking lush on a sunbed, this is the original Katy Perry album cover . Nightmare! Katy Perry's album One of the Boys was heavily doctored by Saudi censors . Many labels now offer two cover options, particularly for their most popular performers, ensuring that the artwork will require no further doctoring and can be sold without causing offence. There have been some memorable redesigns in recent years with Kylie Minogue wearing a wrap to cover up her white swimsuit, on the cover of her 2001 record Fever, Madonna swapping her revealing dominatrix outfit in favor of a one-piece leather body suit for her 2008 album Hard Candy, and Katy Perry being consumed by clouds on 2010 hit Teenage Dream, all in the name of Middle Eastern decency. Almost all of Mariah Carey's albums have been adjusted for audiences in Asia while Christina Aguilera has also been targeted by the censors. In Lady Gaga's 2013 album, the cover was also altered for its Middle Eastern release. The blue orb she holds in front of her was enlarged to cover what was visible of her breasts. It's a wrap! In pictures for the Glitter album, Mariah is shown wearing tops that cover virtually all exposed flesh . Spot the difference: Mariah has been censored on a number of occasions, with many of her album shots proving too raunchy for Middle Eastern audiences . Cover girl: Butterfly by Mariah Carey showed the singer wearing a top covering her shoulders and belly button . Her legs were also colored to make her appear clothed. Of course, America has its own history of moral censorship of photos too. However censors in the U.S. typically don't try to re-clothe people who are deemed to be wearing too little. Instead offending details such as belly buttons and exposed nipples are removed or blurred out. American Apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad 'amateur models' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from 'real women' around the globe. Earlier this week the company made a rebranding change that saw the company choosing to airbrush out some of the models' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins. Tasteful: Kylie Minogue's Fever album was redesigned to prevent anyone getting hot under the collar . Stripped: Christina Aguilera's attempt to be sexy was kept under wraps in Saudi Arabia .",

        "article": "Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his\u00a0taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the\u00a0Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for \u00a3450-a-night hotels during his \u00a313,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that\u00a0Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around \u00a31,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around \u00a310,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least \u00a36,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put \u00a3743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to \u00a3120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of \u00a3383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that \u00a3383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' \u00a3272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and \u00a3208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just \u00a361.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged \u00a3896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some \u00a34,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The \u00a3896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one \u00a3896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the \u00a3150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by \u00a3203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly \u00a35,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined \u00a31,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

        "article": "These days the Cheltenham Festival is a marathon not a sprint but Willie Mullins appears to have an outstanding chance of establishing a big lead in the trainers\u2019 title with four stellar chances on Tuesday. Sky Bet Supreme Novices\u2019 Hurdle favourite DOUVAN (Cheltenham, 1.30) is the first of the Mullins battalion to leave the blocks before the baton is passed to powerhouses UN DE SCEAUX (Cheltenham, 2.05) in the Arkle Chase and the exciting FAUGHEEN (Cheltenham, 3.20), who boasts an outstanding chance in the Stan James Champion Hurdle. Many feel Annie Power will complete the victory parade with her coronation in the OLBG Mares\u2019 Hurdle, but she will be priced prohibitively to do so and her task may not be as straightforward as it seems after a year\u2019s absence. Douvan is the first of Willie Mullins battalion to race at Cheltenham on Tuesday . Of the quartet, Faugheen arguably faces the most competition with last year\u2019s winner Jezki and The New One, an unlucky third following an interrupted passage, in opposition along with National Hunt legend Hurricane Fly. However, Faugheen\u2019s potential is as yet untapped, whereas the level his rivals have reached is known \u2014 albeit a lofty standard. The selection destroyed the opposition in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton with the form receiving a boost when third-home Blue Heron, beaten 17 lengths by Faugheen, hammered Irving at Wincanton in Grade Two company. That performance poured scorn on the theory Faugheen has beaten nothing in his unbeaten eight-race hurdling career, although it is worth noting he also boasts a 22-length mauling of Josses Hill in a Punchestown bumper and a 12-length demolition of the talented Valseur Lido on his record. Fuagheen, pictured on Monday, faces tough competition from last year's winner Jezki and The New One . In short, the son of Germany could prove to be a class apart, especially if The New One continues to drift right at his hurdles, a habit which threatens his hopes of becoming a champion. Jezki is solid and comes to himself at this time of year on spring ground, but his limitations have been somewhat exposed by Hurricane Fly in Ireland this winter and he remains vulnerable to an emerging talent like Faugheen. Hurricane Fly has been done few favours by the drying ground, but the third of Mullins\u2019 representatives, Arctic Fire, could sneak into the places. Tuesday\u2019s nap vote goes the way of CAUSE OF CAUSES (Cheltenham, nap, 4.40), who appears to have undergone an interesting preparation for the National Hunt Chase and was a fine second in a handicap at the meeting 12 months ago when an error at the last fence denied him victory.",

        "article": "(CNN)With tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in Ferguson, Missouri, state and county police took over protest security in the St. Louis suburb Thursday. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol are assuming \"command of the security detail regarding protests,\" St. Louis County Police said, while Ferguson Police will remain responsible for \"routine policing services\" in the city. The takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside Ferguson police headquarters were shot in what St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar called an \"ambush,\" spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers. \"We could have buried two police officers,\" Belmar told reporters. \"... I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.\" Belmar said several people \"have been very forthright\" with investigators, but authorities haven't released the names of any possible suspects. Investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting, and one of them might be the shooter, a law enforcement official said. Police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away. This isn't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security. When clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year, Missouri's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the State Highway Patrol to take over. After that emergency declaration expired in December, Ferguson Police resumed command of protest security. Officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night near the scene of the shooting, religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters. Dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters Thursday night. This time, Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officers Association said, the security situation on the streets is different. \"It's a very tense situation, as you can well imagine,\" he told CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"In my communications as a union official with police commanders, I've been assured that tactics will be different tonight. I assume that means not only more officers, but a wider perimeter, with coverage, perhaps, of these blind spots from which the shots were fired last night.\" Shots rang from a hill overlooking the station out shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department. Officers saw \"muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,\" Belmar said. Protesters have disavowed any ties to the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. \"As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don't know,\" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. \"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people...who have been protesting.\" Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, for a reason. \"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,\" he said. That department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report came out documenting a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned from his post Wednesday. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works in that St. Louis suburb's Police Department. One is from Webster Groves, a city about 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other wounded officer was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old from St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for the past 14 years. Both men were treated and released from St. Louis' Barnes Jewish Hospital. Brown's parents condemned the shooting as \"senseless,\" saying such violence against law enforcement \"will not be tolerated.\" So did the White House, with a tweet signed with President Barack Obama's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling \"violence against police ... unacceptable.\" And U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who visited Ferguson in the aftermath of Brown's shooting and unrest that spurred, decried what happened as a \"heinous and cowardly (and) repugnant attack.\" \"What happened last night was a pure ambush,\" Holder said. \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. This was a damn punk who was trying to sow discord.\" Iresha Turner says police banged on her door in the middle of the night. \"I opened the door and stood back. I look at my chest, there's a red dot on it,\" she said. \"I have my hands up, start crying. I said, 'please, don't shoot me.\" Turner was one of three people who were questioned for hours by investigators Thursday and eventually released. But they never saw the shooting and had no idea who opened fire, she said. Turner thinks police questioned her because she was in a car of people who sped away after the shooting -- not because they had anything to do with it, she said, but because they were scared after hearing gunshots. It's not known what connection, if any, the shooter or shooters had to Wednesday night's protest. One irony is that, for some protesters, Wednesday was a day to celebrate: They'd called for Jackson's resignation for months, and finally it was happening. But for others, it was not enough. That's why they congregated in Ferguson, to demand changes like disbanding the city's entire Police Department and ousting Mayor James Knowles. Some chanted, \"Racist cops have got to go.\" Others held signs with slogans such as \"They don't really care about us!\" and \"Black lives matter.\" \"It was a great group (with) great, great energy,\" protester Markus Loehrer said. Three were arrested in a crowd Belmar characterized as agitated and \"pretty rowdy\" at times. Demonstrator DeRay McKesson told CNN that one fight that occurred had nothing to do with the protests. At its peak, some 150 protesters congregated Wednesday night in front of the Ferguson police station, Belmar said. About 70 law enforcement officers from multiple departments came in to stand in front of the station, as they have on many other nights -- with the turnout of demonstrators the highest since the November grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. There's the manhunt, of course. And then there's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well. Even though Jackson, City Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out, some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change. \"We aren't satisfied with this,\" Reed said of the police chief's exit. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it's not what total justice looks like in Ferguson.\" Jackson expressed optimism that, in his view, the Justice Department report concluded that Ferguson \"can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be.\" But what are the prospects after Thursday's shooting? Loehrer worried that the shooting will undercut the protesters' message against discrimination and violence. \"It's a shame that somebody had to take advantage of this great group,\" he said, \"to do something so despicable.\" And Belmar said it underscores the fact that, eight months after Brown's death, the streets of Ferguson are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge. \"This is beginning at times to be very difficult for any law enforcement agencies, anywhere, to really wrap their arms around,\" he said. \"I want everybody ... to understand how difficult this is.\" CNN's Holly Yan, Joe Sutton, Sara Sidner, Jason Carroll, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez, Don Lemon and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.",

The 31-year-old, who fights in Texas on May 9 against Omar Figueroa, has declared himself bankrupt this week with debts of \u00a3419,888 after a courtroom showdown with his former promoter. Warren had claimed unsuccessfully for \u00a31.8million in lost profits at the High Court in London last year after Burns joined Eddie Hearn\u2019s Matchroom stable on March 11, 2013. But the judge also ruled Burns was not entitled to end the promotional agreement with Warren\u2019s company and owed him commission. Ricky Burns, pictured in action against Raymundo Beltran in 2013, has been declared bankrupt . The former world boxing champion\u00a0said his remaining assets are worth only \u00a3228 . Boxing promoter Frank Warren (left) and Burns, pictured here in 2010, were embroiled in a courtroom battle . Burns paid his own \u00a3200,000 legal fees and a further \u00a3170,000 to cover Warren's damages . Burns teamed up with promoter Eddie Hearn in 2013 amid frustrations over two postponed fights . In December, Burns paid his own \u00a3200,000 legal fees and a further \u00a3170,000 to cover Warren\u2019s damages and costs. The judge ruled Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns \u00a3102,000 in purses but said he was unlikely to receive anything from the liquidated company. Frank Warren said: \u2018I brought a claim against Ricky Burns because he wrongly terminated his management and promotional agreements. I offered to meet him to try to sort things out after he had terminated, but he did not take me up on this offer.\u2019 Burns and Warren are pictured at a press conference in 2012 before they went their separate ways . The Scottish fighter, in action against Jose Gonzalez in 2013, joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing . Burns is hoping to revive his career in America with a fight against former world champion Omar Figueroa .",

Burton face Stevenage at home on Monday and the Shrews took advantage to make up ground with a third-straight win thanks to midfielder Grant, who struck in the 25th and 66th minutes. Wycombe kept pace at the top with a 1-0 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge, where Aaron Pierre's close-range effort kept the Chairboys level on points with Shrewsbury. Portsmouth's Danny Hollands and Shrewsbury Town's Jason Lawrence battle for the ball  at Fratton Park . Neither Bury or Southend, fourth and fifth overnight respectively, were able to close the gap on the automatic promotion places as their clash at Gigg Lane was abandoned in the sixth minute after torrential downpours had left the pitch unplayable. James Gray's late goal kept Northampton in the play-off hunt as they clinched a 2-1 home win against Luton. Ricky Holmes converted a 66th-minute penalty to haul the hosts level at Sixfields after Luton's Alex Lawless had fired the visitors into the lead early in the second half. Shrewsbury Town's John-Louis Akpa Akpro has a shot at goal during the  League Two match at Fratton Park . Reuben Reid fired a double to help lift Plymouth into the play-off places following a 3-0 win at Cheltenham. The midfielder struck in the 34th and 60th minutes and Zak Ansah made sure for the visitors with his 86th-minute header. Aaron McGowan fired Morecambe into a 17th-minute lead at Exeter, but substitute Alex Nicholls struck back as the home side earned a 1-1 draw. Grecians striker Tom Nichols was sent off in stoppage time. Hartlepool climbed out of the bottom two with their fourth-straight victory. Brad Walker headed them into a 20th-minute lead against Cambridge at Victoria Park and - although Matt Harrold equalised - Scott Harrison crashed home his first goal of the season to clinch a 2-1 win. James Gray celebrates after scoring his sides winning goal during the match between Northampton and Luton .

Keith Lowe headed York in front, Coulthirst added a second in the 17th minute, Jake Hyde headed a third and Coulthirst grabbed his second in the 89th minute.

        "article": "Radamel Falcao has admitted for the first time that he is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The Colombia star has stayed silent amid speculation that United will reject the opportunity to turn his \u00a35million loan from Monaco into a permanent \u00a343m deal. But Falcao conceded on Tuesday that he will probably have to look elsewhere for regular first-team football, having not started a game under Louis van Gaal for the last month. Radamel Falcao dropped a major hint that he could leave Manchester United when his loan expires . \u2018Obviously I need to find a place where I have continuity and can play,\u2019 Falcao said in Bahrain, where Colombia play a friendly on Thursday. \u2018I think any footballer needs to play and is happy playing. \u2018So when the championship ends surely I\u2019ll sit down, do an analysis and decide what\u2019s best for me.\u2019 Falcao has scored just four goals in 22 appearances for United, where he earns \u00a3280,000 a week, and was made to play for the club\u2019s Under 21 team earlier this month. His mentor and former agent, Silvano Espindola, revealed last week that the player has been reduced to tears by his treatment at Old Trafford. Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old striker but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations. The Colombian has been more used to starting from the bench for the Reds this season . \u2018Calls come every day so in that sense I\u2019ve got to stay calm, but I keep on the fringe of them, there are people who deal with all that situation,\u2019 said Falcao. \u2018I owe myself to Manchester United at the moment, I have faith and hope because lots of things can happen in the number of matches remaining. I will continue to fight to the end at Manchester United.\u2019 While United are happy to let Falcao leave Old Trafford, they will do all they can to ensure that \u00a359.7m record signing Angel di Maria stays. The Argentine is said to be unsettled in England just seven months after arriving from Real Madrid. Falcao came on as a substitute in United's win against Liverpool on Sunday and has scored just six goals . Di Maria\u2019s form has dipped after a bright start and his family have been unhappy since an attempted break-in at their Cheshire home last month. United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, meanwhile, has refuted suggestions that his presence in the team leads to a long-ball game, saying: \u2018We play beautiful football.\u2019 Robin van Persie could return against Manchester City on April 12 following a month out with ankle ligament damage. United have no plans to let\u00a0\u00a359.7million record signing Angel di Maria leave the club in the summer though .",

Jose Antonio Santiago, 33, is charged with causing an accident involving death or injury in the hit-and-run near Allentown after cops identified him by matching the car parts lost at the scene to those missing from his badly damaged car. State police say 62-year-old Anna Lewis was hit so hard that her body was cut in half and that the upper half of her severed torso was found in Santiago's Saab. Scroll down for video . Sliced in half: Anna Lewis (left, with her niece) was hit so hard in a hit-and-run Sunday that she was sliced in half at the waist with her top half ending up in the driver's car and the bottom being left behind . Her sister\u00a0Rosalie Carlo, 51, of Brooklyn, New York, suffered a broken wrist and other injuries in the crash, reports LeHighValley.com, after the sisters were hit while walking on the shoulder of a road in Hanover Township. Carlo and Lewis had just left a restaurant where they had dinner, when 'I saw a bright light and I felt a push,' Carlo recalled from her hospital bed Monday. 'I felt enormous pressure, like a Mack truck hit me.' The next thing she remembers, she was being roused by a passerby who told her help was on the way. Meanwhile, her sister's lower torso was among the debris left behind by the hit-and-run driver, her head and torso had presumably crashed through the driver's windshield. 'I hope he rots in hell,' she would later tell Lehighvalley.com. 'It's not right. My sister was a good woman.' Police found Santiago's heavily damaged car about 90 minutes after the crash and Santiago two hours later when he approached a state trooper at his damaged car and identified himself. Police say Santiago admitted driving a friend home from a bar that night after having a few drinks but denied hitting anyone. 'I hope he rots in hell': Lewis's sister Rosalie Carlo (center) was with her when a car sliced her in half and drove off with half her body in the car . Suspect approached them: Police searched the scene and found pieces of a car left behind, including a side mirror and front grill. They soon found a badly damaged car with the missing parts . 'Was there a crash on Airport Rd? I had looked on WFMZ news and seen there was a hit and run accident, I didn't hit anyone. I would've stopped. I'm not a bad person,' he told them, apparently without prompting. He also told them, 'I was just bringing my friend home and it all happened so fast, but I didn't hit anyone. If I did, I would've stopped.' Left at the scene were a car's mirror, the front grill, the right headlight, a portion of a window and other parts, according to records. Police discovered Santiago's car was missing those parts. His right pant leg was also covered in red 'body matter.' Police indicated that Santiago smelled of alcohol but did not specify whether he'd been given a field sobriety test. Police did say they suspected both alcohol and speed were factors, reports WFMZ. He's been charged with a felony count of accidents involving death or personal injury, reports LeHighValley.com. He was locked up in Lehigh County jail in lieu of $275,000 bail. It remained unclear whether he'd face DUI charges. Also unclear was whether Santiago had anyone else in the car at the time he allegedly hit Lewis. Jose Antonio Santiago, 33, approached the police as they inspected his badly damaged 2003 Saab and told them he'd heard about a hit and run on the news. Police say he was covered in blood and smelled of alcohol . Horrific: The horror crash occurred as the sisters were walking along the median on Allentown's Airport Road .",

In the internal document, Brent Callinicos, 48, who joined Uber Technologies Inc in 2013 after serving as treasurer and chief accountant at Google, writes: 'For me, there is no later. It is now. 'It is time to do what I have desired for a very long time; time to keep a promise to my wife of not missing another school play, swim meet, or academic achievement of our daughter\u2019s childhood.'

Scroll down for video . Family man: Uber's CFO Brent Callinicos (pictured) has revealed he is stepping down from the online taxi service in an epic memo in which he says he is keeping a vow to spend more time with his wife and daughter . A man of his word:\u00a0Callinicos wrote that he had made a promise to his wife, Julie, not to miss another school play, swim meet, or academic achievement of their daughter, Alexi . Daddy's girl: Callinicos wrote that he wants his daughter, who is in middle school, to 'understand how important time is before time becomes a blur to her too' Successful: In the internal document, Brent Callinicos, 48, who joined Uber Technologies Inc (file picture) in 2013 after serving as treasurer and chief accountant at Google, writes: 'For me, there is no later. It is now' In the email, Kalanick said Guatam Gupta, 'Brent's right hand on Strategic Finance', will be the acting head of the company's finance division until a replacement is either found or named. Callinicos, who will stay on at Uber as an advisor and consultant, is the second financial head of a major Silicon Valley company in only a week to depart with a memo about prioritizing family. Last week, Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette announced in a Google+post\u00a0that he was quitting his job to travel the world with his wife in what he described as a 'perfectly fine mid life crisis'. In Callinicos inspiring memo, seen by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal, the CFO quoted philosopher John Dewey: 'Time and memory are true artists; they remold reality nearer to the heart\u2019s desire.' He went on to explain how it is time for him 'to encapsulate what matters most to me', such as helping his daughter 'understand how important time is before time becomes a blur to her too'. 'After 26 years of nonstop work since MBA School, I am going to step back and spend some time with my family and let someone else take this amazing company to the next level as CFO,' he said. Executives: Callinicos's planned departure was confirmed in an email by Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick (left). Right, last week, Google CFO Patrick Pichette also left his job with a memo about prioritizing his family . 'My daughter is in middle school; my wife has been supportively waiting to spend time with me for 28 years. I made a promise to both of them that I would be taking a long break at this stage of life.' Callinicos thanked Uber and his talented colleagues, and said he was stunned by the company's success over the past two years. He added that he will be staying on as an advisor at the firm. '[I] will always be emotionally connected to this company. I will miss everyone here, but, like the rest of the world, I will watch and admire from the sidelines as I begin a new life with my family,' he said. Kalanick's email, which was seen by Reuters and Mashable, also referred to Callinicos's desire to spend more time with his family - and said the businessman had done a 'wonderful' job at the firm. Rise to popularity: Uber, which is valued at around $41billion (compared to the $3.5 billion it was valued at when Callinicos joined the firm in 2013), is now available in more than 53 countries and 200 cities worldwide . 'Brent has done a wonderful job here at Uber but has decided that it is time for his next journey, one where his wife and daughter take the front seat,' the 38-year-old CEO wrote in the email. He added that Uber was around '1/10th' of the size it is today when Callinicos joined the company. Callinicos, who lives in California's San Francisco Bay Area with his family, is one of the highest ranked executives to leave Uber. He also previously worked for The Walt Disney Company. Gupta, who will be acting head of finance, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president.

Individuals affected by the breach could get up to a maximum of $10,000 each, the proposal says. Details of as many as 40million credit and debit card accounts were exposed during the breach, which hurt its holiday sales that year. Scroll down for video . Target, based in Minneapolis, has proposed to pay $10million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought against it following a massive data breach in 2013 . The company has offered free credit monitoring for affected customers and overhauled its security systems. The proposed settlement would also require Minneapolis-based Target Corp. to appoint a chief information security officer, keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers. It would be required to establish a procedure to monitor data security, and to respond swiftly to future breaches. 'We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution,' Target spokesman Molly Snyder said in an emailed statement. The company said in court documents filed in Minnesota that the funds for reimbursements will be kept in an interest-bearing escrow account. Claims will mostly be submitted and processed online, through a dedicated website. Target's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year . The chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident. Over the 2014 holiday season, Target offered free shipping on all items. It recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $25. And on Wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands. Target's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from Canada has been met with optimism on Wall Street. The retailer's stock traded above $80 for the first time Monday. Earlier this month, Target said it would lay off about 1,700 people, eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $2billion in costs. It will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth. This will involve an investment of about $1billion, which will be aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online. A court hearing on the proposed settlement is set for Thursday in St. Paul, Minneapolis.",

        "article": "Radamel Falcao's miserable career at Manchester United reached a new low on Tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager Louis van Gaal. Falcao has not played a minute of football for United's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal's stuttering team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal at home on Monday night. Now the \u00a3250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21 team in their game against Tottenham on Tuesday night. Radamel Falcao losing his footing as he tries to escape the attentions of Bongani Khumalo (left) Falcao reacts as a chance goes by (left) while Rafael (right, centre) is congratulated on his goal . Falcao's spectacular fall from favour is starkly shown by the 'U21' badge on the arm of his United shirt . Van Gaal's decision to select the 29-year-old in the Under 21s is indicative of the United manager's ongoing concerns over the Colombian international's fitness levels. However, the United boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury. Falcao has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal. United officials say Falcao, one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last January, was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first-team's clash with Spurs at the same venue on Sunday afternoon. Falcao heads the ball towards goal but his drought goes on after another unsuccessful outing . Sportsmail reported earlier this year that Falcao feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels. But on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from Louis van Gaal after an anonymous performance. In a poor first half Falcao dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker James Wilson's goal-bound effort wide from an offside position. United coaches (left-right) Paul McGuinness (U18s), Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Tony Strudwick (fitness) watch on . Falcao looks to get in between the Tottenham defence at Old Trafford as United are held by Spurs . Falcao has another effort on goal but is again frustrated as United searched for the winner . Expertly marshalled by Spurs' centre-half pairing of 17-year-old Cameron Carter-Vickers and South African Bongani Khumalo, 28, the Monaco man cut a desperately frustrated figure. In the second half he was at it again when he diverted Sean Goss's shot into the arms of Spurs keeper Luke McGee before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end. In contrast Brazilian right back Rafael, fighting for his future at United, was a standout. He calmly intercepted McGee's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively Spurs midfielder Kenny McEvoy's opener. Having only scored four times during his six months at United, the chances of Falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil. United have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while Falcao feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by Van Gaal. After Monday's cup exit against Arsenal, Van Gaal reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign Falcao and release Danny Welbeck last August. Welbeck returned to Old Trafford to score the winner in Arsenal's 2-1 win. Last night Welbeck said: 'Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I'm a fan and it's hard to knock them out. I'll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception from them and I'm thankful for that.' The Colombian looks bemused as he is substituted before shaking hands with coach Warren Joyce .",

        "article": "A small town in Upstate New York stands divided after their high school's decision on Wednesday to broadcast the Pledge of Allegiance in Arabic. It was meant as a way to celebrate National Foreign Languages Week--each day, the announcements and pledge at Pine Bush High School would be recited in a different tongue. However, the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the Pledge of Allegiance in English. Now, lines have been drawn in Pine Bush (pop. 1,600) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than English. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Pine Bush High School in Upstate New York celebrated National Foreign Languages Week by reading the pledge in different tongues and caused outrage Wednesday by reading it in Arabic . School\u00a0Superintendent Joan Carbone told the Times Herald-Record the controversy has 'divided the school in half.' 'Something that was supposed to be good but turned out not to be,' Carbone admitted. The attempt at teaching a lesson in multiculturalism caused a backlash almost immediately. The Herald-Record reports that the broadcast by\u00a0student assembly president Andrew Zink was 'greeted by catcalls and angry denunciations in classrooms throughout the school.' By Wednesday afternoon, Principal Aaron Hopmayer had apologized in a schoolwide announcement. The school would also soon post an apology to its website. 'The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country,' the statement read. 'We sincerely apologize to any /students, staff or community members who found this activity offensive. In our school District the Pledge of Allegiance will only be recited in English as recommended by the Commissioner of Education.' 'It's the right thing to do': Student assembly president Andrew Zink did the reading and says he would do it again. However, administrators were quickly forced to apologize . Students came out both against the reading and against the backlash as\u00a0Superintendent Joan Carbone said the controversy had 'divided the school in half' Though he didn't make the decision to make the day's announcements in Arabic himself, according to TWC News, Zink says he was perfectly okay with reading the Arabic script for the day, though he knew it would be controversial. 'I knew exactly what would happen,' he told the Herald-Record. 'I knew many wouldn't support it.' That includes many of the student politician's constituents at Pine Bush. 'Here's my issue. You made the decision to turn the school against itself, a move you knew would make Pine Bush look bad,' student Alan Bavolar tweeted to Zink. Student Alex Krug also opposed the recitation. 'It's the Pledge of Allegiance, we're saying it to the American flag. I think it should be said in English. It is foreign language week but we don't even offer Arabic in Pine Bush High School,' he said. Others supported Zink's decision and were appalled by the backlash, like senior Miranda Monroe, who tweeted: . '\"I go to Pine bush but I'm not racist\" *Me introducing myself to new people*' Despite all the controversy, Zink won't apologize for his decision to read the pledge in Arabic. 'It's the right thing to do,' he said. Zink was bombarded online by his detractors and his supporters Wednesday but says he supports what was initially a gesture of multiculturalism . . .",

        "article": "The Ohio mother who allegedly beheaded her three-month-old baby has been released from hospital and booked into jail on aggravated murder charges. Deasia Watkins, 20, said nothing as she appeared handcuffed and in a yellow jumpsuit before a Hamilton County judge on Friday morning. Her bond was set at $500,000. A grand jury will hear evidence in the case on March 26 and will decide on an indictment. She is accused of decapitating her daughter Janiyah at her aunt's College Hill home on Monday morning before placing the knife in the child's hand and going to bed. After her family found the grisly scene, Watkins, who had previously been ordered to stay away from the child after being hospitalized with psychiatric problems, was taken to hospital for evaluation. In court: Deasia Watkins, who has been charged with aggravated murder in the beheading death of her baby daughter, said nothing at her first court appearance in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday . On Thursday evening, she was released and taken to Hamilton County Jail. While she was under guard at Deaconess Hospital,\u00a0Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that she was not talking to authorities. 'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking. 'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' Watkins gave birth to baby Janiyah in December and was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis in January after police responded to a report that she was screaming in her apartment. Watkins, left, allegedly murdered three-month-old Janiyah, right, at her aunt's Ohio home on Monday . She was ultimately ordered to keep away from the child, who was handed over to her aunt, and family services caseworkers said they believe Watkins may not have been taking her medication, which could have caused delusional thinking. Deters said it is believed Watkins moved in with her aunt about a week before the murder. On Monday, the aunt's son dropped his children off at the house so they could catch the bus and a five-year-old boy entered the home and found the murdered baby on a kitchen counter. Janiyah had been stabbed at least 15 times across her body and had a fractured arms, the coroner revealed. The five-year-old boy ran outside to get his father, who then woke up Watkins' aunt, and together they called 911. 'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the chilling 911 call. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!' Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call . Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.' When the dispatcher pushes for more information, he says:\u00a0'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. 'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby and Watkins in bed. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December and the baby's father, James Brown, told\u00a0WCPO she\u00a0'just started acting different' about a month after the birth. He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected . Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . On January 24, police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their home. Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out with her eyes open. Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. 'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.' She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Behind bars: Watkins is now being held at Hamilton County Jail, pictured, on $500,000 bond . Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents were neglectful. Social workers checked on the baby girl once a week - at least 10 times in total - and warned relatives to keep Watkings away from her before the murder, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'. He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.",

The fate of the Airbus A320, which appeared to drop out of the sky yesterday over the village of Barcelonette, appears to mirror that of Air France flight 178 which crashed close by in 1953. The aircraft, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, was coming into land at Nice airport, when it crashed into the side of Mont Le Cimet, close to Barcelonette. Scroll down for video . A map showing the close proximity of an Air France crash in 1953 to that of the Germanwings disaster yesterday in the French Alps . According to accident investigators at the time, the service was en-route to Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, from Paris with stops in Nice, Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan and India. However, the plane encountered stormy weather over the French Alps with residents in the small village of Fours St. Laurent reporting seeing the aircraft crash into the mountainside and burst into flames. When rescue teams reached the scene the next day, there were no survivors, with all 35 passengers and nine crew members killed. Among those that died was French violinist Jacques Thibaud. An Air France Lockheed aircraft, which flew the airline's service from Paris to Saigon in the 1950s. A similar model crashed in the French Alps in 1953 less than a mile from the doomed Germanwings aircraft yesterday . Famous French violinist Jacques Thibaud, who was killed in the Air France crash in September 1953 . Investigators then put the cause of the crash was down to 'controlled flight into terrain'. This means that an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, water, or an obstacle, with the pilots generally unaware of the danger until it is too late. Yesterday's crash in almost the exact same spot, all 144 passengers, including six crew members were killed on the flight en route from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. The majority of the passengers were Spanish and German with 16 children from the same school in Haltern near Dusseldorf losing their lives. A French Gendarmerie helicopter flies over the snow covered French Alps during a search and rescue operation. The crash site is less than a mile from the 1953 disaster . It has been claimed that the doomed Germanwings plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked, causing a sudden drop in oxygen that rendered the pilots unconscious. Reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the Airbus A320 had been analysed and revealed that a 'structural failure' was responsible for the disaster. It is thought the windscreen gave way, incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call. Rescue helicopters have today resumed the search for debris and bodies at the crash site. As with the crash 60 years ago, there are no survivors . Today, search operations resumed at first light this morning in near-freezing conditions for debris and bodies at the crash site. Reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem, a day before it was due to fly from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Urgent safety checks are now being carried out on other A320s - popular with budget airlines - while passengers were left stranded at Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester yesterday after several Germanwings crews refused to work over safety fears..",

According to one source, the slogan was dreamed up by advertising agency M&C Saatchi, which is working on the Conservatives' campaign ahead of May's poll. But it was quickly rejected by the Chancellor, who said it was 'patronising and insensitive'. Scroll down for video . Pictured is how the slogan vetoed by George Osborne might have looked as a poster . Instead, the party replaced it with the slogan: 'We are with you' which is expected to be used during the campaign . The slogan was quickly rejected by the Chancellor, who said it was 'patronising and insensitive' Instead, the Tories opted for the more cautious 'We Are With You', which was launched by the Prime Minister in Manchester yesterday. A source said: 'There was general astonishment when it was suggested 'Well Done You' was a good message. It is patronising and would rightly have been greeted with a large raspberry by the electorate. 'We already have a struggle on our hands to rebut Labour claims that Cameron and Osborne are rich and out of touch. Short of putting a picture of Marie Antoinette on it, I can't think of anything worse. 'It didn't take very long for Osborne to tear it up.' M&C Saatchi went back to the drawing board and later produced the far more successful image of Labour leader Ed Miliband peering out of the top pocket of former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. The agency was set up in 1995 by Maurice and Charles Saatchi. The brothers' previous firm, Saatchi and Saatchi, designed Margaret Thatcher's famous 'Labour Isn't Working' poster in the run-up to the 1979 Election. Last night a Tory Party spokesman said of the slogans: 'We do not talk about campaign matters.' Nick Clegg is banking on female 'floating voters' Nick Clegg is banking on female 'floating voters' to save the Liberal Democrats from an Election wipeout. Officials revealed they were targeting 'undecided' women voters in the party's vital marginal seats. They cited research across 18 seats showing women switching to the Lib Dems as polling day approaches. Aides to Mr Clegg boasted that women warmed to party pledges such as improving mental health treatment and cutting income tax by \u00a3400. One said: 'Our progress since 2014 suggests we are winning the battle for women voters.' Mr Clegg, who launches his Election campaign today, will spend the opening days supporting the party's 'key female candidates'. He will also unveil the Lib Dems' battle bus, complete with radio transmitter so he can do his call-in radio show on the road.

        "article": "(CNN)Legendary fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are in a public spat with pop music icon Elton John over some eyebrow-raising comments the pair made about gay parenting. Long against same-sex marriage, the Italian designers -- who are not only openly gay, but were once a couple -- took their counterintuitive rhetoric to the next level this weekend when Dolce said in an interview: . \"You are born to a mother and a father -- or at least that's how it should be. I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented uterus, semen chosen from a catalog.\" John, who along with his husband David Furnish is raising two children that were conceived through IVF, took to Twitter to essentially say \"Oh no he didn't,\" followed by \"#BoycottDolceGabbana\" because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag. Not to be outdone, the pair responded with #BoycottEltonJohn. So what should we make of all this boycott talk? Combined, the three men are worth an estimated $3 billion. The openly gay Ricky Martin, who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother, sided with John (but he's only worth an estimated $60 million, so I'm not sure if anyone noticed). Regardless, while I find the archaic thinking of Dolce and Gabbana disappointing, the truth is my budget boycotted their clothing years ago. Some of it's really nice. But I just can't afford to spend $500 on a T-shirt. And even if I could, I don't know how I would justify doing so with a kid to put through college. That's why I find this whole ultra rich on ultra rich violence so disconnected from the reality most of us on Twitter are living. Boycott? Besides the 1%, who the hell is buying Dolce and Gabbana regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a \"boycott\"? That's a little like me saying I'm upset with the way James Dolan is running the New York Knicks so I refuse to play for him. Even misguided consumers wallowing in debt and living way above their means likely do not have enough credit cards to keep up with the purchasing power of the Elton Johns of this world.  (No lie -- the online store has a pair of \"Polka Dot Print Slim Fit Denim Jeans\" for $795. And you still have to pay for shipping. And there's also a cotton vest on sale for $795. A COTTON VEST!!) Here's an idea: Considering it can cost about $20,000 for each attempt at IVF, and the procedure has roughly a 40% success rate, I would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of Dolce's words are not using their expendable cash to buy their clothing anyway. If John, Martin, Courtney Love and other ultra-rich celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into (pun intended) take that would-be Dolce and Gabanna money and start an endowment for those who can't afford IVF treatments. Or consider \"Modern Family's\" Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who tweeted he wanted to unload his Dolce and Gabanna suits in a way that would help those who can't afford the IVF treatments. Retweeting a hashtag is a great way to publicly shame. But crowdsourcing among the 1% could make a difference in the lives of people who so desperately want to be parents that they mortgage their homes trying. It also creates a medium in which us regular folks can legitimately express our disappointment in the designers' words and not take the convenient route via blogs and hashtag activism. And yes, I realize I'm criticizing myself as well. But I have some self-awareness. When you tweet \"Je Suis D&G\" -- thus comparing your PR nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent Europe history -- you don't.",

        "article": "Chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs in a new race hate storm - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train. After the club\u2019s victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, a man was heard to say on the London to Manchester service: \u2018Paris, Paris, Paris, that\u2019s the way we like it, a n***** on the door\u2019. This was a reference to the shocking incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game. The five culprits were overheard making references to another Chlesea racism scandal in Paris in February . Filming the incident, one passenger captures the Chelsea supporters making anti-Semitic remarks . A video of the latest incident - obtained by The Sun and broadcast by ITV London News on Thursday - was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly. The clip - in which only the seats can be seen - also features someone saying \u2018Tottenham are a load of Y**s\u2019, referring to the club\u2019s Jewish fan base, and \u2018John Terry is a racist, a racist, a racist\u2019. Club captain Terry was banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing then QPR player Anton Ferdinand . The passenger who shot the latest footage - with whom police have been in contact - described his journey as '90 minutes of hell', saying nobody dared to confront the supporters. The video ends when as a man is heard warning his friend \u2018somebody might be filming us\u2019. British Transport Police said officers had received complaints from passengers on the train. The supporters also made references to club captain John Terry (centre) Deigo Costa and Terry pose with the Capital One Cup trophy on the Wembley pitch after the 2-0 victory . Detective Sergeant Michael Maher said: \u2018I want to hear from anyone who was on the train, particularly in coach E, around the time it reached Stoke, 10.40pm. \u2018By the accounts we have received, the group were chanting insults at other passengers, and some of these insults may have been racist. We are in the process of checking CCTV. \u2018But I would like to hear from any passengers who may have captured the behaviour of the group on mobile phones. Such footage could be crucial to our investigation.\u2019 The video was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London to Manchester (file picture) The fans were travelling north towards Manchester from London Euston station (file picture) Four men were ejected by police who boarded the train, with their names and addresses taken, while another four left by choice. And Rory Jennings, from the Chelsea Fans Channel, told ITV London: 'It's northern Chelsea fans. There's obviously some, but they should be quite easily pinpointed. 'The club have done wonderful work with regard to stamping out racism - but it just shows you that there's further to go. These people need to be identified, banned and arrested. It's shocking.' Chelsea are helping police with their probe - 'and their efforts to identify the individuals' A Chelsea spokesman said: \u2018We are assisting the British Transport Police with their enquiries, and their efforts to identify the individuals involved.\u2019 Police are also investigating racist chanting at London St Pancras station after Chelsea\u2019s match at Paris St-Germain on February 17. They have identified all those believe to have been involved - the day after the Paris Metro incident \u2013 and they will be interviewed. It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game last month. Chelsea won 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in north-west London on Sunday, with the goals scored by Terry and Diego Costa. Anyone with information about last Sunday's incident on the train from Euston should contact BTP on 0800 405040, or by text, to 61016, quoting B5/PSUB of March 5, 2015.",

        "article": "A while ago, I visited a Hampshire nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year. It was like a slow-motion factory; tissue-cultured plantlets came in at one end, flowering specimens trundled out of the other, each in a posh ceramic pot. Orchids, particularly Phalaenopsis (moth orchids), have become Britain's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks. That should not happen. Moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and, with care, they can flourish for years. But it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs. Hardy beauty: Moth orchids (pictured) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms . More than 22,000 species of orchids make up Orchidaceae, the world's largest flowering plant family. About 50 are native to Britain, and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow. With such a huge range of habitats, orchids' needs differ widely. But once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids, it's not hard to keep them happy. KNOW THEIR NEEDS . Phalaenopsis, like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes, meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees. They subsist on rain or mist, and nourishment comes from debris lodging in the tree bark, so their sparse roots are as important for clinging on as for absorbing nutrients. In a pot in your house, the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest. That means a minimum 16 degrees Celsius ambience, humidity and good light. To boost humidity in spring and summer spray rainwater on to the leaves from an atomiser (if possible always use rainwater warmed to room temperature). In winter, move your orchid closer to an east or west-facing window and the extra light will encourage flowering. The commonest cause of death is overwatering. To avoid that, imagine the orchid perched up a tree, soaked by rain from time to time but drying out in between. Cram the roots into wet compost and it will die. That is why it is best to grow epiphytes in slatted containers or transparent, perforated orchid pots and to allow the prehensile roots to poke into the air. During the growing season, feed monthly with special orchid feed. But in winter, reduce watering and do not feed. HANDS-ON MANAGEMENT . Phalaenopsis should last for about three months but, when they fade, you can persuade the old stem to sprout again. Feel it carefully for swellings (nodes) near the base. They are dormant buds. If you cut the stem just above the second node from the base, a new flower spike should develop. Repot your orchid only if it has become pot-bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years. Do that when the pale roots develop green tips; a sign the plant is ready to repot. Use special epiphytic orchid compost \u2014 it will appear coarse and lumpy and is available at good garden centres. Remove any dead or shrivelled roots, shorten the remaining healthy ones to about 12cm and replant the orchid in the same size pot. Pack the compost in firmly for stability and allow any upward-facing roots to grow out over the container's sides. Water thoroughly, making sure all the compost is moist and that the water drains away easily. Next year, when the repotting has worked and you are flush with success, start looking for different orchids. The number of new varieties introduced each year beggars belief. Happy hunting.",

Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was not present at Friday's court proceeding. The terror attacks in India left more than 160 people dead in November 2008. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. On Friday, India summoned the Pakistan high commissioner \"to convey our strong feelings about (the) Lakhvi verdict,\" said India's external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. Last year, the court granted Lakhvi bail, a decision the Pakistani government had said it would challenge. Many in India are still angry over the attacks and had criticized the bail decision. \"It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail,\" the nation's home minister, Rajnath Singh, said in December.

        "article": "An alleged fraudster who claimed to own half of Facebook has vanished from his home just weeks before his New York-based trial after ditching his ankle monitoring bracelet, his lawyer has said. Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, sued the social network's billionaire founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2010, claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start-up money. In 2012, he was charged with fraud after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against Zuckerberg, 30. He was due to go on trial on May 4. However, it has now emerged that Ceglia is missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet. 'I don\u2019t know where he is,' his attorney, Robert Fogg, admitted. 'I haven\u2019t got a clue.' Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Paul Ceglia (left), 41, who sued Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg (right), in 2010, has vanished from his home just weeks before his New York-based trial after ditching his ankle tracking bracelet, it has emerged . Speaking to Reuters, Fogg said Ceglia's tracking device had been found at his home, in New York's rural Allegany County, after the U.S. Marshals Service was dispatched to check on him on Sunday. He said he has not heard from Ceglia, adding that U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick has now \u00a0scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday that was 'most definitely spawned by the recent event'. Last April, Buffalo federal judge Richard Arcara\u00a0officially closed the book on Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it . The ruling affirmed a magistrate judge's recommendation from a year earlier, saying  the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract Ceglia had based it on was faked. Ceglia had claimed that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract, 'The Face Book', that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for start-up money for the firm. At the time, Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University. Although Facebook's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract, they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit. Missing: Ceglia (pictured), of Wellsville, was charged with fraud in 2012 after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his 2010 lawsuit against 30-year-old Zuckerberg . Claims: Ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in Facebook (pictured) - was due to go on trial on May 4. However, he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet . Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. The lawyers argued that the the only valid contract between the pair related to that company. At the time of Ceglia's arrest,\u00a0Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.' 'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company added. 'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails.' Facebook CEO: Last April, Judge Richard Arcara officially closed the book on Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it. Above, Zucerkberg is pictured speaking during a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last Monday . On Monday, Fogg said that Ceglia - who has pleaded not guilty - has 'always been concerned with justice'. 'He has always been concerned about if he'd get a fair trial,' the attorney added. Ceglia has twice  tried to get the charges  dropped. He is also appealing against the 2014 ruling. Ankle monitoring bracelets are typically fitted to individuals under house arrest or parole. At timed intervals, they send a radio frequency signal containing information, like location, to authorities. If an offender moves outside of a permitted range, the police will be notified. The devices are designed to be tamper-resistant - they are meant to alert authorities if  offenders remove them. November 22, 2003 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at Harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours. If we don\u2019t make a move soon, I think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them. 'I\u2019ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $1000 for the facebook (sic) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or Jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them. Please give me a call so that we can talk more about this.' January 1, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I think it is unnecessary at this point, with all of the extra work I have done for you, to be held to the original completion date. I should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control, namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the Streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority, thereby delaying my start on our second project. 'Thus, I am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract.' January 5 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'It is well past January 1 and to my knowledge you don't have a single thing done for the site... You know perfectly well that you can't just take a person's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard. 'I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know what's going on.' February 2, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have a rather serious issue to discuss with you, according to our contract I owe you over 30% more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80% of the company. 'First I want to say that I think that is completely unfair because I did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second I don\u2019t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty. 'Mostly though I just won\u2019t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage. I\u2019d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership.' February 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Sorry it\u2019s taken me a few days to respond, (sic) Now that the sites (sic) live I feel I must take creative control and I just can not risk injuring my sites (sic) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk, nor do I wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni. The site is cool as it is and I don\u2019t care about making any money on it right now, I just want to see if people will use it.' February 7, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Mark, all I can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and MONEY that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh I\u2019ve changed my mind I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to make money and that that should be that.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it, so I am thinking of just taking the server down. My parents have a fund that I can tap into for my college expenses and I would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work. At this point I won\u2019t even really be able to work on the facebook until Summer.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Grow up, take a f***ing ethics class, choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours.' July 22, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia (A week before Facebook was incorporated) 'Paul, I am guessing that you don\u2019t want to talk to me but I wanted to say happy birthday and that I hope to resolve our differences. I see that what I did was wrong and I am really sorry that I behaved as I did. Please give me your address and I will mail you back the $2000 for your trouble, more if it will repair our business relationship. 'Another summer is here and I still don\u2019t have any time to build our site, I understand that I promised I would, but other things have come up and I am out in California working during break. I just don\u2019t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and I won\u2019t be able to. Best, Mark'",

        "article": "(CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged \"in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. \"The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video.\" The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: \"I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.\" Cisse's statement said: \"I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.\" Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been \"disgusting.\" \"This is not acceptable,\" he said. \"There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis.\" Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: \"Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. \"I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.\" And former Liverpool player Steve McManaman told the channel: \"Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans' neck from about six inches. It's absolutely disgusting. \"Two wrongs do not make a right. If Jonny Evans has spat at him then it's wrong, but for Papiss Cisse to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting. We talk about bad tackles, but that is worse.\"",

        "article": "England have slipped down the FIFA world rankings for a second consecutive month with Roy Hodgson's side now lying in 17th place, behind the likes of Romania and Czech Republic. After a disastrous World Cup, the Three Lions have fallen despite winning all four of their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia as well as international friendlies against Scotland and Norway. However, with rankings based on results over the last four years, England are below  Costa Rica (13) who held them to\u00a0a goalless draw in Brazil before winning their World Cup Group D. England have fallen behind the likes of Romania and Czech Republic in the latest FIFA rankings . Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson has seen his side fallen despite being unbeaten since the World Cup . A team\u2019s total number of points over a four-year period is determined by adding: . The average number of points gained from matches during the past 12 months . And, the average number of points gained from matches older than 12 months (depreciates yearly). Meanwhile, 2010 World Cup winners and reigning European champions Spain have fallen out of the top 10 in FIFA's rankings for the first time since 2007. World Cup winners Germany is still No 1 ahead of Argentina, Colombia, Belgium and the Netherlands. The only change in the top 10 is that Italy rise two places up to 10th, while Spain drop one spot to 11th. None of the elite teams played in the last month, but games played earlier in the four-year cycle of results lost ranking value. Reigning European champions Spain have fallen out of the top 10 for the first time since 2007 . Romania rise two places at No 14 and could be seeded in July when European qualifying groups for the 2018 World Cup are drawn. Costa Rica remain No 13 to lead CONCACAF nations. The United States falls one to No 32. Algeria at No 18 lead the African nations. Iran are Asia's best at No 42.

Alaska Rep. Don Young made the remark during a\u00a0House Natural Resources Committee hearing yesterday. Young, 81, was responding to a letter 79 members of Congress sent to\u00a0Interior Secretary Sally Jewell asking her to reconsider her agency's 2011 decision to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list. Scroll down for video . Alaska Congressman Don Young, 81, made his gray wolf remark yesterday while speaking at the Capitol . The gray wolf (above) was removed from the endangered species list in 2011. Some want it put back on the list . Alaska had 1,913 homeless resident in 2012 according to a Homelessness Research Institute report . Young, a Republican, supported the decision to delist gray wolves and does not want them to reacquire protected status. During Young's remarks to Jewell, he called the gray wolf a 'predator' that is 'killing the cloven-hoof animals', according to Alaska Public Radio. He said: 'We've got 79 Congressmen sending you a letter. 'Haven\u2019t got a damn wolf in their whole district. 'I\u2019d like to introduce them in your district. 'I introduce them in your district, you wouldn\u2019t have a homeless problem anymore.' Hunting wolves is allowed in Alaska. Young said a healthy wolf population would 'wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy' After Young's remark generated backlash and requests for clarification, he released a statement. Young said his comment was an 'analogy' that was 'intended to be hyperbolic in nature' to help highlight that wolves pose a serious problem to communities in his state. He wrote: 'Anyone who\u2019s dealt with a healthy, roaming wolf population, as we have in Alaska, understands that these predators have a detrimental impact on wildlife populations. 'If you misunderstood my comments, just imagine the impact a healthy wolf population would have on your own town, community, or congressional district. 'It would wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy.' There are an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 gray wolves in Alaska, according to Defenders of Wildlife. Alaska had 1,913 homeless residents in 2012 according to a Homelessness Research Institute report.",

Ms Lambie said her thrift was the result of more than $20,000 of debt, which meant she was not able to splash out on her clothing. However, the fiery politician said she has splashed out on at least one luxury, admitting to getting botox injections in her back and face,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Daily Telegraph. Senator Lambie in the colours of her then-party in October, 2013, speaking at a Palmer United Party press conference . 'I haven't had a makeover,' Senator Lambie said, when asked if she had undergone a make-over since she arrived in Canberra. 'This is how it works. When I first came in, because I had sold my house and used every last bit of money I had, Clive Palmer in the end helped me get over the line, I had nothing left. 'It took a couple of months to get back on my feet and the only things in my wardrobe I pretty much got from Vinnies over the last two years. It would have only been $3 to $4 apiece. Bright yellow scarves were a staple for Ms Lambie in 2013 (pictured: left), but she gradually toned down the colout in 2014 (pictured: middle) and 2015 (pictured: right) 'I haven't had a makeover,' Senator Lambie said, when asked if she had undergone a make-over since she arrived in Canberra . 'You know, if you want to look nice and you're in the public spotlight, that's just part of the job,' Ms Lambie said . 'So I've just basically gone out and bought some new clothes. I've got girlfriends. One of them owns the shop in Davenport. I try to keep it local. So I thought, 'bugger it, I will just do it at Christmas time when they've got all their sales and stuff'. 'I have a heap of Botox in my back, right, so every now and again I put some in my crow's feet.' 'You know, if you want to look nice and you're in the public spotlight, that's just part of the job.'

        "article": "(CNN)In a side room at the American University of Nigeria, four girls chat and giggle. One teenage girl in particular catches our attention. She looks familiar. Then we realize why. We met her just a few weeks after Boko Haram had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students. As the Boko Haram trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants' territory, she and her friend bravely jumped, barely escaping with their lives. She was one of the lucky ones. School, she says, from that day on became a reminder of what almost happened. A place she never wanted to return. But now she is back and the change in her is remarkable. She dreams of remaining in the classroom as a teacher, so that just like her tutors, she can influence and inspire young minds. Studying with her here are 21 other girls from Chibok. They, too, escaped Boko Haram. Like hundreds of others across Nigeria's North East, they were targeted simply for going to school. Choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education, which they hope will bring change back home. \"My people need my support,\" one girl says. \"And me going to school will make that change,\" She wants to be a surgeon. In a part of the world often lacking the most basic health care infrastructure, she has chosen to bring value to her community. One of three students we spoke to who want to study medicine, she's extraordinarily focused and firm in her responses. It is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at Boko Haram's hands, what they almost lost. Some questions, though, they can't answer: any questions about the night of the attack, any reference to the friends still missing. These are too hard. Enrolled on scholarships at the university, these girls are the lucky ones, and they know it. There are 46 other Chibok girls who also escaped Boko Haram, but there are no funds available to pay for their education. Dr. Margee Ensign, the school's vice-chancellor, is hoping to change that by raising funds through the university's foundation. \"The world paid, and rightly so, a lot of attention to the close to 300 that were kidnapped,\" she says. \"We heard through various people that some had escaped that night and when it came to our attention that about a dozen wanted to come to AUN, we thought, we can do that!\" She did more then just raise the funds. When the parents agreed to release their girls into her care, she and her security director traveled -- just the two of them -- to the outskirts of Chibok to go and get the girls, in spite of the insecurity. Even on campus, though, the specter of Boko Haram is never far away. The American University is in Adamawa state, one of the states in North East Nigeria that is under a state of emergency. This calls for constant vigilance at the school: Cars are searched by hand and guards and sniffer dogs are on constant patrol. For the girls, to remain in school, they must draw upon all their reserves of courage. It is a reality these extraordinarily self-possessed young ladies softly acknowledge. When I ask how it is they are able to persevere, one girl says with a slight smile, \"I'm very brave and determined.\" She really is. All the girls are. But they're hoping a day will come when they won't have to be.",

        "article": "A Dallas woman faces up to 20 years in federal prison for her role in the overdose death of a 19-year-old apparent first-time heroin user. Rian Lashley, whose teenage YouTube debut revealed a talented and beautiful singer rife with potential, died in March 2014 after a stripper's implausible attempt to rob her of $3,000 went terribly wrong. That stripper, Cierra Rounds, gave her disgusting account of the ill-fated plot in court on Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Sad: 19-year-old Rian Lashley was killed in an attempt to rob her by injecting her with heroin that went terribly wrong, prosecutors say. Dallas stripper Cierra Rounds, right, revealed in court Tuesday the calamitous chain of events that led to Lashley's demise . The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with the young woman at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin. While they ate, the New York Daily News reports, Rounds and her friend\u00a0Kathryn Dirks, 25, came to discover that Lashley was carrying $3,000 cash ion her purse. Rounds soon reached out to her drug dealer, identified as J.C. or Jaymo, NBCDFW reports, and the plan was hatched. 'I figured ud (sic) want me on this money,' Rounds texted J.C. The trio then drove to a home in Dallas. J.C. told Rounds via text message to keep Lashley there. 'Ima bout (sic) to shoot her up for her first time,' Rounds said. At the home, prosecutors say Rounds and Dirks, at Lashley's request, injected heroin into the teen. Tragic: The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with Lashley at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin . China White: The 19-year-old had never done heroin. She was sold three bags of China White by Rounds' cohort\u00a0Glen Brunton, according to prosecutors . Little girl lost: Lashley's funeral home obituary page is covered in heartfelt condolences to Lashley's family, as well as photos from her painfully innocent-looking upbringing . Later that afternoon, Lashley began to appear distressed. Rounds said Tuesday that they then put the teen in a bathtub of ice water in order to try to counteract the heroin. She appeared to go to sleep thereafter and died that afternoon. An autopsy revealed her death was due to heroin overdose. Dirks and a man to whom J.C. gave the heroin to sell to Lashley, 28-year-old Glen Brunton, were indicted on drugs charges last year, the Dallas Morning News reports. Brunton goes to trial in April. Dirks is still a fugitive. Rounds remains jailed pending sentencing and faces a $1 million fine along with her potential jail time. She returns to court in September.

Unions representing Qantas staff claim they've been inundated with complaints after flight attendants and pilots were moved to a hotel next door to the 'happiest place on earth' Disneyland and the busy convention centre. Qantas made the move from Costa Mesa, an hour and a half south of Los Angeles Airport, to the Anaheim Hilton in the last 12 months. In the last 12 months Qantas staff have been staying at The Anaheim Hilton which is right next door to Disneyland and its convention centre . Unions claim they have been inundated with complaints that staff are unable to sleep in the new accommodation Qantas is providing . This move follows airline chief Alan Joyce's announcement \u00a0of cost cuts worth $2 billion over three years after suffering losses in recent years. The new lodgings are about half-an-hour closer to the airport and reportedly cut accommodation costs by two-thirds, or approximately $100 per night. Flight Attendants Association Australia National Industrial Officer Steven Reed\u00a0told Newscorp\u00a0that flight attendants and pilots are unable to get adequate rest because of the noise coming from the theme park and its neighbouring convention centre. \u2018By the time you get to the hotel you want to go for a walk and then get some rest, not face a rock band playing in the foyer and kids running up and down the halls.' He warned if crews aren't adequately rested they'll be required to report as \u2018unfit for duty\u2019 which could result in flight cancellations. Although the Anaheim Hilton is about 30 minutes closer to the airport than previous accommodation, unions insist the hotel is too noisy for airline staff . A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that they observe rigid protocols in relation to the amount of rest staff must get and it is always in the best interest of the airline to ensure these requirements are met. She said Qantas often 'go above and beyond' the regulatory rest requirements to ensure the 'wellbeing' of flight crew. In response to recent allegations that staff are being mistreated she said  the airline uses 'number of different hotels in LA', which are not limited to the Anaheim Hilton. A Qantas spokeswoman said ensuring its staff's well being is of the utmost importance . The spokeswoman said Qantas are trying to resolve the issue by collaborating with the hotel to better organise accommodation around scheduled music events that may cause concern for staff. A spokeswoman from the Aneheim Hilton said the noise heard from the convention centre is minimal, however, if there are events held in the courtyard the noise can be louder. She added that noise complaints are few and far between because of noise restrictions that are put into place at 10pm each night to ensure guests are not effected. Daily Mail Australia contacted Flight Attendant Association Australia however they were unavailable for comment.

        "article": "When her beloved dog collapsed and had to be rushed to the vet, Heather Goddard was horrified. The grandmother was left grief-stricken when tests showed Clover, an eight-year-old crossbreed, had lung cancer and would have to be put down. But the biggest shock came when she was told that her dog\u2019s death was caused by passive smoking \u2013 the result of being in the house as she and her husband Keith puffed through 30 cigarettes each a day. Scroll down for video . Devastated: 62-year-old Heather Goddard, from Seaton Delaval, said her dog got lung cancer after inhaling the toxic chemicals from tobacco smoke - she is now speaking out to protect pets in the future . Happier times: Ms Goddard, with husband Keith, granddaughters Chelsea and Leona and dog Roger, quit smoking a year ago and has been told she now smells 'like a proper grandma, which is lovely to hear' Now Mrs Goddard, 61, has quit smoking and is alerting other pet owners to the dangers posed to animals by second-hand smoke. She and Mr Goddard, 67, of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, were walking Clover in a park when the rescue dog became ill. They took her to a veterinary practice in Morpeth, where they were told she had black spots on her lungs and was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The vet said nothing more could be done for Clover, adding that the cause of her cancer was passive smoking. \u2018Knowing my smoking was to blame was like somebody had just put a bullet into my heart. It was a nightmare that had come true,\u2019 said Mrs Goddard, a retired cleaner who has another dog, Roger, as well as two cats and a rabbit. \u2018Clover was a lovely dog. She was friendly and there wasn\u2019t a bad bone in her body. Fond memories: She says thinking about Clover 'brings a tear to my eye just thinking about the damage my smoking was doing' - she is now hoping to inform others about the dangers of second-hand smoke . Clover had to be put down after a scan showed up black spots on her lungs . \u2018She showed no signs or symptoms of being ill. We had no idea why she had collapsed until we took her to the vets. It was such a shock. \u2018You don\u2019t think about your animals but they are just like us. They can get illnesses like diabetes and cancer the same as us.\u2019 Mrs Goddard says she now regrets exposing her family and her animals to years of cigarette smoke in the house and the car. She added: \u2018I think I would have tried to give up earlier if I had known the damage it was doing to my animals. As long as the animals were fed I would be happy to go without food but I had to have my cigarettes. \u2018I didn\u2019t connect passive smoking with animals. You don\u2019t realise how much of it they are taking in. My grandchildren are only here once or twice a week but our pets are with us 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u2019 It still took her nearly three years following Clover\u2019s death before she managed to quit her 30-a-day habit \u2013 and by then she too had been diagnosed with chronic lung disease. Her husband has also given up smoking, much to the delight of their three children and eight grandchildren. Mrs Goddard, who had smoked for 40 years, said: \u2018I feel a lot healthier now I have stopped. \u2018I can walk to the end of the path without getting as out of breath and I don\u2019t use my inhalers as much. New start: Ms Goddard pictured with her grandchildren - who are 'always happy that I no longer smoke' \u2018My grandchildren tell me they are glad I stopped smoking because I don\u2019t smell of smoke any more. When I gave up smoking that stopped my illness from getting any worse.\u2019 She hopes by speaking out she will alert other animal owners and help protect more pets from the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. \u2018I would tell anyone who smokes and has animals to think twice,\u2019 she said. \u2018I know how difficult it is to give up but they need to think about their animals. Don\u2019t give up trying, even if you have two cigarettes less a day.\u2019 The British Veterinary Association has long warned of the dangers of smoking around pets, saying it can lead to incidents of cancer, asthma and bronchitis in cats and dogs.",

        "article": "Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell has publicly attacked Labour candidates turning down donations from Tony Blair - and warned they should prepare for another Tory government. Two candidates have already rejected Mr Blair after he offered 106 key battleground seats \u00a31,000 each to fight the election.\u00a0The former Prime Minister said the swing constituencies were 'where the election will be won for Labour'. Mr Campbell this morning accused the candidates of being 'attention seeking' and questioned whether they wanted to win. Alastair Campbell has slammed Labour candidates turning down a \u00a31,000 donation from Tony Blair . Writing on Twitter he said: 'To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?' The message sparked an angry backlash from Labour activists who said they were glad candidates were rejecting the money. But Mr Campbell hit back, warning they should 'enjoy another Tory government then'. Mr Campbell's remarks came after Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan said her constituency would not be accepting the money. Writing on Twitter she said: 'Received donation from Tony Blair. Instinct was to not accept. Discussed with team. Dundee East is not accepting the \u00a31000.' Northampton candidate Sally Keeble has also turned down the money. She said: 'The \u00a31,000 donations are being offered to key seats \u2013 of which we were one. I have emailed them back to say we won't be accepting.' Former minister Sally Keeble (left) and the Labour candidate in Dundee\u00a0Lesley Brennan (right) have rejected Mr Blair's donation . Mr Campbell became embroiled in an online row with Labour activists over Mr Blair's donation . When the donation was announced last week a Labour spokesman said the party was 'delighted' that Mr Blair had put his own money behind the effort to get Ed Miliband into Downing Street. In a letter to the 106 candidates Mr Blair said: 'As the final countdown to the general election begins, I am writing to wish you every success in your efforts to be elected and also to make a donation to your campaign. 'I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital.' He added: 'This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns. 'As one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government. 'So, good luck and here's to a Labour victory on May 7.' Mr Blair is in a position to donate \u00a3100,000 after making a fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007. Leaked documents published yesterday revealed how he proposed a \u00a330million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy.",

        "article": "A 13-year-old boy, whose mystery illness bound him to a wheelchair with a feeding tube, has made a miraculous recovery after years of suffering thanks to his determined mother who scoured the internet for answers as to why he was in excruciating pain. According to the Today\u00a0show, Bobby Leithauser, from Marco Island, Florida, was originally diagnosed with dysautonomia, a malfunction in the autonomic nervous system, and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a tissue disorder - but the conditions didn't account for all of his ailments, which included stomach afflictions, loss of vision and agonizing neck pain. Refusing to accept her son\u2019s initial diagnosis, Bobby's mom, Keri Leithauser, began researching his symptoms online, and came across the work of Dr. Harold Rekate, a neurosurgeon at the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York, who soon discovered her son had a Chiari malformation, a treatable, yet rare condition that affects the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance. Scroll down for video . Miraculous discovery: Bobby Leithauser, 13, suffered from a painful mystery illness for years before being diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, a rare condition that affects the part of the brain that controls balance . Needing a cure: Bobby's parents,\u00a0Keri and Tom\u00a0Keri Leithauser, explained that their son started having crippling stomach pain when he was only nine-years-old, requiring him to have a feeding tube . Last December, Dr Rekate operated on Bobby, performing a surgery that he had invented, to fix the condition which cause his spine to press into his brain. Three months later, Bobby recalled the days after his surgery, saying he 'couldn't believe' his unbearable pain was gone after years of suffering. The teen's health problems seemingly came out of nowhere when he was only nine years old, when the once-active child began to experience crippling stomach pain, prompting his parents to start limiting his food to the point that he was only consuming blueberries and chicken. But despite their best efforts, his ailments continued. Next came headaches, tremors and an inability to control his body temperature or regulate his blood pressure. But even after Bobby was diagnosed with dysautonomia and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, his physical suffering continued. Difficult prognosis: Bobby, who was active as a boy, found himself bound to a wheelchair after his condition worsened . 'It was really horrendous pain and I couldn't hold my head up for more than 10 minutes at a time,' Bobby explained. As his condition worsened, his worried mom began doing research on the internet and contacted other parents whose children had similar issues. Chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include dizziness, muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems, headaches and problems with balance and coordination. Chiari malformations\u00a0mostly occur during fetal development, although they may develop later in life after\u00a0injury, infection or\u00a0exposure to toxic substances . It was once believed that\u00a0Chiari malformations occurred in only one in every 1,000 births, but research shows that they appear to be more common. Babies who are born with Chiari malformations don't develop symptoms until adolescence or adulthood - if they develop them at all . 'I started putting the pieces of the puzzles together,' she said. Her husband Tom noted that because their son's issues started with severe abdominal pain, they found themselves focused on the wrong area of his body. 'The whole time we were looking at stomach pain, never imagining that the problem could be in another part of his body, like the brain,' he said. Mrs\u00a0Leithauser's determination to cure her son eventually brought her family to Dr. Rekate. As soon as the neurosurgeon saw scans of the boy's skull and spine, he immediately knew what was wrong. The scan revealed that Bobby's skull and spine were not held together properly because the ligaments were too loose.\u00a0The misalignment was causing his brain to be squeezed from the front and the back. 'I knew that he could be helped by surgery,' Dr Rekate said. 'I knew that the chronic pain that he was in, that the inability to exercise could be helped, that we could change his life.' Bobby is now walking again, and his chronic pain and headaches are gone as expected. But what is even more surprising is that the issues associated with his autonomic nervous system suddenly started to get better as well. 'To me, it's a miracle. It really is a miracle,' Mr\u00a0Leithauser said. Magical surgeon: Dr Harold Rekate explained that Bobby's skull and spine weren't hooked together properly, which caused his spine to push into his brain . Fast recovery: Three months ago, Bobby had surgery to properly align his skull and his spine, which improved all of his ailments and allowed him to start walking again .",

The mother was horrified after she and her baby were left stranded at Gold Coast Airport after their plane turned around on the runway, delivering her to federal and local police who had been alerted by the airline. Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out to the runway on Gold Coast airport. Scroll down for video . Virginie Rutgers was\u00a0forced off a flight with her son after she refused to stop breastfeeding during take-off . Virgin Australia are being questioned on social media for their decision to turn their plane around to take a woman and her baby back to the terminal, where she was questioned by police .

A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the \u2018shocking\u2019 incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page. Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed. \u2018The child was not restrained with the carrier at all! They both had their seat belts on. She was covering herself with the carrier while nursing.\u2019 Ms Fairweather wrote. Virginie used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy whilst they were reportedly both buckled in different seats, but she was told to remove the blanket by Virgin Australia staff . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff . \u2018She showed (the staff) too but they insisted it had to go.\u2019 Ms Fairweather was shaken by the staff\u2019s conduct during the confrontation. \u2018Having witnessed the whole event, I can honestly guarantee you that it was not a pretty scene.\u2019 \u2018(Ms Rutgers) did comply with the rule by restraining herself and the child.\u2019 \u2018Absolutely gobsmacked at how rude and offensive the staffs were - totally unprofessional (Sic),\u2019 she wrote. The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child\u2019s head with a sling was a hazard. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane. \u2018I was in a state of shock honestly. He (her son) was screaming because I couldn\u2019t feed him any more,\u2019 Ms Rutgers told Seven News. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane.

The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff. Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast Airport. Virgin Australia has refused to compensate her for the cost of her hotel that evening or for her taxis. But the airlines denies allegations of discrimination against the mother and said her breastfeeding had nothing to do with decision to remove her from the flight, according to Seven News. 'Our crew acted in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations and, most importantly, with your child's safety at the forefront of their actions,' Virgin said. People aware of Ms Rutger\u2019s experience have taken to Virgin Australia\u2019s Facebook page. \u2018Utterly pathetic sevice virgin! I fly frequently and will make sure i NEVER fly with you again. I do not want to get kicked off a plan for breastfeeding my child,\u2019 wrote one former customer. \u2018Breast feeding is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child,' a supporter wrote on the Virgin Australia Facebook page . \u2018(Breast feeding) is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child.

Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again. She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day . However other people on Facebook have sided with Virgin Australia, pointing out their responsibility to adhere to strict safety protocols. \u2018I think anyone with any sense would realize the issue here. Safety comes first. Breastfeeding is a right all mothers should have, but that right shouldn't take precedence over safety,\u2019 argued one person. \u2018I am sure that the staff had their reasons for asking her to remove the carrier, it may have been a projectile or strangulation risk in the event of a difficult take off,\u2019 wrote another. \u2018I wasn't there so I can't comment on how it was handled but I do think you have to trust the staff when it comes to safety requirements and requests.\u2019 Virgin Australia have offered Ms Rutger flight credit to make up for the additional costs she accrued when she was kicked off her flight.

The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the bacteria are not likely to be a threat to the general population. The worker tested positive to exposure of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause can cause melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease. \"It is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread,\" according to the CDC website. The CDC is waiting on additional test results to determine if the exposure occurred at the research center or somewhere else, McDonald said. The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture are at the campus, continuing an investigation that began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others have antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. Since then federal health officials have been working with state and local officials to investigate the source. Blood tests have been conducted on nearly 70 primates at the center, with one testing positive for antibodies, McDonald said.

A group known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking want to take legal action in the English courts over the way Google tracks users of Apple Safari's internet browser. They accuse Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements. The group believes a landmark ruling in their favour now opens the door for litigation by millions of internet users. Ruling:\u00a0Google users will have the right to sue the internet giant in British courts over its 'clandestine tracking of their browsing (file picture) Three  judges have dismissed Google's appeal over a High Court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information. Today's ruling was a victory for Safari Users, including editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall, and Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, who are both IT security company directors. They say Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and early 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. They accuse Google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent by the use of 'cookies' - a small string of text saved on the user's device. Dan Tench, a partner at law firm Olswang, which represents the group, is quoted by the Times the landmark ruling potentially 'opens the door for litigation by millions of British Apple users'. He said the case decides 'whether British consumers actually have any right to hold Google to account in this country'. Mr Tench added: 'This is the appropriate forum for this case - here in England where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy.' A group of internet users want to sue Google, claiming the internet giant secretly tracked their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts. The claimants, known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking, all used Apple's Safari browser and have accused Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts. Google was accused of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws . They say that cookies, small tracking files, were installed by Google on the Apple computers and mobile devices of those using the Safari internet browser without their knowledge. Cookies are used by advertisers, and owners of other websites, to target advertising based on an individual's internet use. The campaigners also say that Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. The claimants accused Google of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws. The appeal judges unanimously ruled that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction, enabling legal action to go ahead. They also clarified the law on the meaning of 'damage' in section 13 of the Data Protection Act. Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, and Lady Justice Sharp said in their joint judgment, with which Lord Justice McFarlane agreed: 'On the face of it, these claims raise serious issues which merit a trial. 'They concern what is alleged to have been the secret and blanket tracking and collation of information, often of an extremely private nature... about and associated with with the claimants' internet use, and the subsequent use of that information for about nine months. 'The case relates to the anxiety and distress this intrusion upon autonomy has caused.' Three judges have dismissed Google's appeal over a High Court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information . The appeal judges said Mr Justice Tugendhat, who heard the case in the High Court, was entitled to come to the view that it was 'clearly arguable' that Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights was engaged and gave weight to allowing the claims to proceed. The judges also said Google Inc had estimated its trial costs at \u00a31.2million, which seemed 'extremely high' and they could be controlled by the court's management powers. They said some of the technical issues in the case may already have been addressed by litigation against Google in the US over the Safari issue. In August 2012 Google had agreed to pay a civil penalty of $22.5million (\u00a315.1million) to settle charges, brought by the United States Federal Trade Commission that it misrepresented to users of the Safari browser that it would not place tracking cookies or serve targeted advertisements to those users. In November 2013 it also agreed to pay $17million (\u00a311.4million) to settle US state consumer-based actions brought against it by the attorneys general representing 37 states and the District of Colombia. After the latest ruling, a Google spokesman is quoted by the Times as saying: 'We're disappointed with the court's decision and are considering our options.'",

        "article": "UKIP supporters have been labelled 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists' and one fan of Nigel Farage is doing little to dispel the idea. Jill, 59, a former nurse from Poole in Dorset, has told a Channel 5 documentary that she believes in angels and thinks the European Union plans to kill people with guillotines. She believes UKIP leader Farage, 50, is our only hope. Scroll down for video . Jill, pictured left at her home in Poole, believes UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured right at his party's spring conference in Margate last week, has been sent from god to save us from a foreign invasion . 'I think Nigel Farage has been sent by God, he probably doesn't realise it,' she reveals on TV show\u00a0Farage Fans & UKIP Lovers, that will air on Channel 5 this evening. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection. 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' Offering her thoughts on why the EU is such a threat, Jill said: 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. Jill told a Channel 5 documentary that she thinks the EU have 'death vans' and they will cut people's heads off with guillotines if they refuse to have microchips fitted . 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. The former nurse is a fan of bondage and says many UKIP supporters share her passion for S&M . Jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful Brits can now be more open about their sex lives . She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage. 'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.' The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself. 'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said. 'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'",

Bride-to-be Kate Elliott (left) and her fiance Daniel Plews (right) will have an empty seat at their wedding . Grant had not played international cricket for 14 months so he thought he could attend his sister's big day . Grant, who was born in South Africa, had not played international cricket for 14 months before he was picked to play one of the great one-day innings for his adopted country. He told his sister he didn't think he would be selected for the squad so Kate went ahead and locked in her wedding date. But on Tuesday, the 36-year-old cricketer slammed a six off the penultimate ball from the world's greatest fast bowler Dale Steyn, giving his team a four-wicket win over the Proteas at Auckland's Eden Park and taking his team into their first ever final. 'From the beginning I said if you can reach your dream that would be incredible,' Kate told NZ Herald. 'He just looked so incredibly happy.

With its bulbous eyes, flat body and tiny fins, the Mola Mola is an unusual sight in the blue waters of California. But short of shying away from the camera the fish appeared to strike a pose. The photographs of the bizarre-looking ocean sunfish were taken by experienced diver Daniel Botelho. Scroll down for video . One of the world's weirdest fish - a Mola Mola - has been captured making a rare appearance above the water by diver Daniel Botelho in San Diego, California . Mr Botelho has spent years photographing the intriguing species all over the world. Despite their large and intimidating presence, he found the fish to be friendly and gentle - with one even following him like a pet. The 34-year-old said: 'They are usually very shy but once they get used to you they can follow you like a pet. 'In my case I had a gentle Mola Mola following me all the time until I got back to the boat. It reminded me of my dog. Mola Mola spend most of their days in deep waters but rise to the surface to be cleaned by other fish and birds . They are the heaviest known bony fish in the world and usually weigh around 2,000lb although larger specimens can weigh up to 5,000lb. Above, a Mola Mola curiously pokes its head up near a boat . Mr Botelho can be seen behind the Mola Mola (left), which is usually found in deeper waters (right) 'I have a special affection for Mola Molas, I love them and I am always looking for the challenge of interacting and photographing these fish.' Mola Mola are the heaviest known bony fish in the world and weigh around 2,000lb. They can grow up to 13ft in length and cannot close their mouth fully. They spend most of their days in deep waters but rise to the surface to be cleaned by other fish and birds. Mr Botelho added: 'They also cause a huge impact on people and I have several photos that have become viral on the internet just because people are amazed by the fish's shape. 'Some wrote to me attesting that they never even thought there could be such a fish in the seas.' Sunfish, or Mola Mola, are the heaviest  bony fish in the world. The largest specimens can reach 14ft vertically and 10ft horizontally, weighing nearly 5,000lb. Sunfish develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because they are born with a back fin that never grows. Instead, it folds into itself. Mola in Latin means 'millstone' and describes the sunfish\u2019s somewhat circular shape. They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture. They are found in temperate and tropical oceans around the world, and are often mistaken for sharks when their huge dorsal fins emerge above the water. Their teeth are fused into a beak-like structure and they are unable to fully close their relatively small mouths. Two Mola Mola rise to the surface. The 34-year-old photographer said:\u00a0'I have a special affection for Mola Molas, I love them and I am always looking for the challenge of interacting and photographing these fish' Despite their large and intimidating presence, Mr Botelho found the large fish to be friendly and gentle - with one even following him like a pet .",

Ashley Brady, 26, has had to learn how to walk again after losing her right leg in an accident last summer and during the recent snowstorm, she struggled to cross the parking lot. So her apartment complex in Miamisburg, Ohio created a handicapped parking spot  at the bottom of the steps to her home. But on Saturday, two days after the spot was designated for handicapped people only, she found another car there with no placard displayed in its window,\u00a0WKEF reported. Shock: Ashley Brady, who lost her leg in an accident last year, found a threatening note beneath her windshield after she complained to a neighbor that they had parked in her disabled parking spot . Cruel: The note, which called her 'Handicap', told Brady to keep her hands off the person's car . So she left a note pointing out the error and warning the driver that their car would be towed if they left it there again. She was stunned when she found a note under her own windshield. 'Hey handicap! First, never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with \"struggles.\" You want pity go to a one leg support group! You messed with the wrong one! I don't care what your note said shove it, but you touch my car again I will file a report, I am not playing! I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine! - B****.' 'Hey handicap!' it read. 'First, you never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with \"struggles\".' The letter instructed Brady to go to 'a one leg support group' if she wanted pity and warned that the police would be contacted if Brady touched her car again. 'I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine!' the letter read. Brady said she was so shocked by how rude the note was that she had to read it several times to process it. Her sister then posted a picture of the note to Facebook to highlight the struggles faced by people with disabilities and it has since been shared more than 1,600 times. Life-changing: Brady said she was relieved to get her own space because of the recent icy weather . New life: Brady shows her prosthetic, which has helped her walk again after losing her leg last summer . On the Facebook post, hundreds of people have given their support to Brady, calling for the writer of the note to be reported to the police or have their car towed. Brady quipped: 'She told me to cry to someone who cares, so I went to the internet and it turns out a lot of people care.' After receiving the note, Brady filed a grievance with the Miamisburg police and notified the management of her apartment complex. The managers said they have not yet decided on a course of action.",

        "article": "(CNN)One of the nine suspects was killed. Another was shot in the stomach. All eight responding officers were injured, including one 10-year veteran who required surgery. It's the aftermath of an all-out melee in a Walmart parking lot in Cottonwood, Arizona, a town of 11,000 people about an hour's drive south of Flagstaff. But details are murky outside of the injury and arrest reports. What's known, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety statement released by spokesman Raul Garcia, is that someone at the store called the Cottonwood Police Department a few minutes before midnight Saturday to report that a woman who worked at Walmart \"had been assaulted in the store by multiple suspects.\" The suspects were in the parking lot when police responded, and they immediately attacked the officers, the DPS statement said. Two suspects were shot, one in the abdomen and one fatally, while one of the suspects shot a Cottonwood officer in the leg, according to DPS. \"I heard about eight to 10 shots,\" Louie Solano, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate KPHO.  \"It was a lot of noise. It looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot. I mean it was unbelievable,\" he said. Investigators believe the nine suspects were all from the same family. \"We believe they are from Idaho because of the license plate on their vehicle,\"  DPS spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. The condition of the suspect who was shot in the stomach was not known. Seven other suspects were taken into custody, the statement said, and \"a total of eight officers and another (Walmart) employee were assaulted in the parking lot during the fight. Seven of those officers sustained minor injuries to include lacerations and bruising.\" The Walmart employee, who was a loss prevention officer, had a broken arm,  Graves said. The 31-year-old officer who suffered the gunshot wound was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. The veteran officer is expected to make a full recovery, according to the statement. The Cottonwood Police Department and the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office directed media questions to DPS. Asked for additional information, Arizona DPS spokesman Bart Graves said, \"This is a very complex investigation, we are still sorting things out and there are a lot of witnesses to talk to, so we are in the early stages.\" He added, \"We were asked by Cottonwood police to conduct a criminal investigation.\" CNN's Brian Carberry contributed to this report.",

The 17-year-old was taken into custody during an FBI raid on the teen's home in Woodbridge, neighbors said. The Washington Post\u00a0reports that the boy, who is a student at Osbourn Park High School in nearby Manassas, is being charged as a juvenile, although officials are working to try him as an adult. High schooler: FBI officials arrested a 17-year-old in connection with a man who traveled to Syria and joined up with ISIS . According to officials whose names were withheld by the paper, the teenager allegedly used online contacts to help another slightly older man travel to Syria and link up with ISIS. Officials said they conducted surveillance on the home for about a month before the teenager's arrest. The man who traveled to Syria is expected to face charges, according to officials, who also looked into another 17-year-old student at Osbourn Park, before judging him to have played a much smaller role. A neighbor said that FBI officials knocked on the front and back doors of the home before someone inside opened up. The boy was later led out in handcuffs, with the officials also carrying a computer and other electronic equipment, the neighbor said. Though she did not give her name, the neighbor said that the boy had attended middle school with her daughter and that in spite of spending most his time in the home, remarked the boy seemed like a typical teenager. Drawn to extremism: The man helped by the teenager in Woodbridge successfully reached Syria through contacts overseas to join up with ISIS (file photo) The boy's alleged online ties to individuals close to the Islamist extremist group surprised some who knew him as a smart young man interested in business and technology. 'He was a brilliant kid,' said Dustin O\u2019Bryant, who hired the teenager to write  for his site Coin Brief. 'His English wasn\u2019t perfect, but I was willing to overlook that because the content was great.' O'Bryant said he hired the teenager for the site, which covers BitCoin and other digital currencies, after being impressed by a chemistry paper the boy wrote. He 'had a really strong understanding of the technology behind digital currency in general and even more advanced systems,' O'Bryant said. BuzzFeed reports that the teenager had not communicated with O'Bryant, who lives in Alabama, since February, when he told him he was going through personal issues. 'He in no way came across as any sort of extremist,' O'Bryant said. 'My hope is that there was some kind of misunderstanding, that he didn\u2019t know who he was helping.'",

        "article": "Marvin Gaye's family have filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of the 1977 hit 'Got to Give it Up.' The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would\u00a0prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single featuring Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams,\u00a0and T.I. Williams and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. Scroll down for video . Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) were ordered to pay $7.4million after a jury ruled that their hit Blurred Lines\u00a0copied elements of Marvin Gaye's (pictured center) 1977 song Got to Give It Up . Marvin Gaye's daughter, Nona Gaye, (left) and two of her siblings filed the injunction in court on Tuesday . Thicke's Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013 and it sold more than seven million tracks in the United States . Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment. The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits. The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist. 'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.' The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Williams had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap\u00a0reported. The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage. 'This did not happen. 'We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 'This also did not happen.' Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013. It sold more than seven million tracks in the United States, topped the pop charts for months and earned two Grammy Award nominations.",

A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said:\u00a0'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off. \u00a0The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to\u00a0get part of the car's number plate from\u00a0CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an\u00a0unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman . Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman . Detectives found 'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in\u00a0Cambridge park Christ's Pieces.\u00a0The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces.\u00a0Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det Sgt Burgess said: 'All were in the early hours of the morning. 'Each of the women were approached by a man who had got out of a car and attempted to get them into it.' He lived a double life with his parents as a mechanic but carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps . He added: 'I'm concerned there are other victims out there either in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridge and would urge other women to come forward. 'It's very rare.' As well as the rape in Norwich, Howard also admitted six counts of rape against a woman between November 1986 and March 1993. Howard, who is understood to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the court on April 20. Judge Stephen Holt told him: 'You've pleaded guilty and the one thing that can be said is your victim has been spared the ordeal of giving evidence. 'I'm sure you will understand I need to have a full pre-sentence report and the whole issue of whether you need to be sentenced as a dangerous offender will be made.' Det Sgt Burgess said: 'Reliving an experience such as this is never easy for a victim of sexual assault. 'I recognise the bravery shown by all victims in this case who would have been prepared to give evidence, had the case gone to trial. 'Howard's guilty plea demonstrates the strong case police had against him and I believe women are safer with this dangerous man off the streets,' he said. 'A striking similarity between the cases is that Howard would prey on women walking alone at night. 'I hope his guilty plea goes some way to helping his victims move forward from this terrible experience.' Howard was a respectable garage mechanic who didn't have a criminal record and lived an extraordinary double life with his elderly parents in Battisford.\u00a0He also had his own house in nearby Stowmarket. He is thought to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend but was 'actively seeking sexual partners' on internet dating sites.",

Tom Dahl, 85, from West Seattle has shared the frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of the new ways criminals are hacking into cars. The thief in the video is shown attempting to open the locked door of Mr Dahl's Honda Ridgeline, but is unable to so he takes off his backpack, holds it up to the window of the vehicle, and seconds later unlocks the car. Scroll down for video . A man from Seattle has captured a thief on surveillance camera easily breaking into his car using a mysterious electronic device (thief pictured above) The thief in the video is shown attempting to open the locked door, but is unable to so he takes off his backpack and holds it up to the window of the vehicle, and seconds later unlocks the car . Tom Dahl (above), 85, from West Seattle has shared the frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of the new ways criminals are hacking into cars . The incident, which occurred last month, involved an unidentified 'key fob' to unlock the vehicle, Detective Patrick Michaud from the Seattle Police Department told Daily Mail Online. Detective Michaud said police received reports of the break in on February 14 at 3am, and that the man seen in the video has not been arrested. The man reportedly searched the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment and took a club that was on his steering wheel, as well as a few store rewards cards that were left in the car, Daily Mail Online was told. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car, according to\u00a0Fox 13. 'You used to have a wire that you slid down the window, when it was mechanical. But now it's electronic,' said Mr Dahl. The man approaches Mr Dahl's car and pulls the handles realizing the door is locked . He then removes his backpack and flashes a light into the car . The man holds the backpack up the door and within seconds it is unlocked . He gets into the vehicle and searches through the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment taking a club on the steering wheel as well as store rewards cards . Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson, said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car, according to an earlier report. Mr Carlson had his car broken into two times before he installed a surveillance camera at his home. 'It's running through codes automatically or it's a button they're pushing or something is happening, but whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys,' Mr Carlson said at the time of the incident. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car (above Mr Dahl's Honda Ridgeline pictured in his driveway) Captain Eric Sano from the police department said that it is apparent as technology adapts, criminals are adapting, so it is important for authorities to be ahead of criminals. Scott Wagner, a special agent from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in January that he had knowledge of a special system being used. He said: 'It\u2019s a little black box. They can carry it in a backpack, when you hit your fob to unlock your car they can actually steal the codes to your keypad and then unlock your car later.' Detective Michaud said there has not been a lot of similarly reported cases in the area over the years and that he is unsure of what kind of device is being used in the break ins. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson (above), said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car . Mr Carlson said: 'Whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys' (above a thief breaking into his car earlier this year) 'I've seen it both ways - a device in their hand as well as a device as big as an iron carried in a backpack,' he said. 'As technology moves on, the device gets smaller.' As for how to stay protected as a driver as this mystery device looms, Detective Michaud warns drivers to keep valuables out of the car. He said: 'We ask that people to not keep anything of value in the car. If you are going to leave your registration in the vehicle cross off identifying information, and let the officer know you crossed it off for security concerns.' The investigation into the incident is ongoing.",

A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in\u00a0Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping. He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom. King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him. Canterbury Crown Court heard he then demanded money, picked up a screwdriver and threatened to stab him. When his victim refused he hurled a TV at him. He then assaulted another neighbour who had heard the women's screams and stole a gold sovereign ring, a wallet, a mobile phone and USB cable. King then went next door where he woke a couple and their young child as he climbed out a window to escape, telling them: 'I am going to a party'. Police arrived to find the teenager standing on a window ledge 25ft from the ground before he climbed down and shouted: 'I'm a terrorist'. King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years. Judge Heather Norton told him: 'You embarked on a course of conduct that night which must have been terrifying for everybody involved.' Not smiling anymore:\u00a0King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault at Canterbury Crown Court\u00a0and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years . Phil Rowley, defending, said King was drunk and had no recollection of the night. He said King had been used to help carry out burglaries since he was five. Detective Constable Neil Moore said: 'It was clear he was heavily intoxicated and decided, in what was a truly bizarre set of circumstances, to hunt out more alcohol. 'It must have been truly terrifying for those involved and the sentence imposed reflects the severity of the crime.'",

A stunning mountain lake, a stretch of rocky shoreline and several sites of ancient woodland, home to red deer and red squirrels, are among eight sites being sold by the Lake District National Park Authority. But the sale has provoked anger among locals who say it would have Lakeland poet William Wordsworth \u2018turning in his grave\u2019. The possible sale of beautiful countryside in the Lake District such as Blea Brows, an area of shoreline alongside Coniston Water on the market for \u00a390,000, has angered locals . Stickle Tarn, a glacial lake popular with swimmers in Great Langdale, is up for sale with a guide price of \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 . They are angry that they were not consulted about the decision to sell the picturesque sites \u2013 worth a total of up to \u00a3665,000 \u2013 and at the \u2018sheer speed\u2019 of the sale, which is being rushed through in five weeks. Perhaps the most impressive site is Stickle Tarn, a \u2018majestic\u2019 24-acre glacial lake in Great Langdale, high above Coniston Water and Windermere, which is popular with wild swimmers. It is up for sale with a guide price of \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000. Forty-one acres of woodland at Waterside Knott, near Newby Bridge, is being sold with a guide price of \u00a3130,000. The site has a 215-year-old Grade II listed viewing tower and is home to red squirrels, door mice, and roe and red deer. Blea Brows, a stretch of shoreline along Coniston Water, is for sale with a guide price of \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000. The ten-acre site has stunning views, a small beach and oak, birch and holly woodland. The Lake District National Park Authority, the Government-funded body responsible for managing the park, insists strict covenants on the land ensure the sites will be protected for the public and rights of way will not be affected. But some locals fear access could be restricted, woodland and historic dry stone walls may not be properly managed and that wealthy buyers may apply for planning permission to build on the land. Majestic: Waterside Knott, a woodland home to red squirrels,\u00a0is being sold with a guide price of \u00a3130,000 . Heidi Halliday, a district councillor for Ambleside and Grasmere, said: \u2018Wordsworth would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening. Everyone is incredibly upset, especially because it has been handled so badly, with no consultation. Stickle Tarn is the only tarn left under the park authority\u2019s ownership. You would think they would want to keep hold of it, not sell it to the highest bidder.\u2019 Last week the House of Lords stepped in to urge the Government to halt the sale. All bids are due in by Thursday but local groups hoping to raise the cash for a community bid say they had no chance to secure enough money in five weeks. The park authority says it has lost \u00a31.56million of Government funding over the past five years and has no option but to sell. It says it has a duty to get value for money for the taxpayer and that a public body need not own the land to be a good custodian of it. Chief executive Richard Leafe described the decision to sell the land as \u2018good management\u2019 in \u2018the existing financial climate\u2019.",

After missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix as he recovered from a concussion sustained in a test crash, Alonso's first outing on his return to the team ended in retirement after 21 laps of the Malaysian Grand Prix due to an ERS cooling issue. As Alonso spoke and delivered his verdict on the weekend when McLaren have at least made some progress, Sebastian Vettel was charging around in the background en route to his first win for 16 months. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso is all smiles in Malaysia despite not finishing the Grand Prix on Sunday . Alonso's McLaren is wheeled into the garage after he was forced to retire from the Malaysian Grand Prix . The German is, of course, Alonso's replacement at Ferrari as the 33-year-old opted to quit the Maranallo marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title. What must Alonso have thought later when he saw Vettel stand on the top step of the podium, the first time a Ferrari driver had done so since the Spaniard himself in his home grand prix two years ago. Whatever Alonso's thoughts, all he can do now is remain convinced McLaren's early woes in conjunction with new power-unit supplier Honda will ultimately lead to the results he craves. It is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain as Alonso said: 'These reliability problems are normal. The Spaniard failed to finish the race on Sunday, managing just 21 laps at the Malaysian Grand Prix . 'What you normally find in winter testing, we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately. We need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so. 'Definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from Australia to here. 'If we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon.' Overall, Alonso expressed 'mixed feelings' as to how the weekend had unfolded, adding: 'I'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made. Both McLaren's failed to finish the race in Malaysia as they continue to struggle for form this F1 season . 'Watching the race on the TV in Australia, we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one McLaren running alone at the back. 'Here we were much more competitive in qualifying, running with everyone in the race, which was a very nice surprise. 'But not finishing the race is never a nice feeling, so let's see if we can improve next time.' Team-mate Jenson Button retired on lap 42 with a turbo issue, leaving neither of the team's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix. \u00c2 .",

        "article": "A gang enforcer convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman who refused to pay a Mexican Mafia-imposed tax on her illegal drug sales is set to be executed this week. The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening would leave Texas prison officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply. At least six executions are scheduled in the coming weeks in Texas, where prison officials \u2014 like in other death penalty states \u2014 have struggled to find providers for drugs for executions. Vasquez, 46, had no appeals in the courts Tuesday and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected a clemency petition filed on his behalf in a 7-0 vote. Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, is scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs \u2014 known as a 'dime.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions barged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term. Court records show the three were carrying out orders from Mexican Mafia boss Rene Munoz, who spent years on the Texas Department of Public Safety's 10 Most Wanted List until his arrest in 2012. Joel Perez, Vasquez's lead trial lawyer, recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was 'very detrimental'. 'We have the Texas Mexican Mafia, and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent,' he said. 'And the motive in this case was she wasn't paying.' The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening at Huntsville prison in Texas would leave T officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . Detectives also found the blood of the victims and Vasquez's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used. 'It put him at the scene when he denied being around there,' Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez, said. 'I recall he was an extremely violent individual. In the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he'd been involved with.' Vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice. One conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire. Records also show Vasquez' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder, and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison.",

        "article": "(CNN)Buddy Elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin Anne Frank. His death Monday brought back memories for me. We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book. I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person. \"Anne Frank's Family\" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out. I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Like millions of people who read \"The Diary of Anne Frank,\" I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage. Anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the Nazis in the secret annex of an Amsterdam apartment. I was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975. After the family was discovered, they were sent to Auschwitz. Later, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died in March 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor of the family, one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from Auschwitz. In the course of my two hours with Elias, I learned new things about the young, Jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world. She called him Bernd, short for Bernhard, Elias' formal name. In his youth, Elias was an actor and a skater with Holiday on Ice. He was her first cousin and 4 years older. They adored one another. \"Bernd, maybe we can skate as a pair together someday,\" Anne wrote in January 1941 from Amsterdam. \"But I know I'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are.\" In another letter, Anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue, fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with Elias. \"She never did get to do that,\" Elias said. On his 17th birthday in 1942, she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met. It was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other. But it turned out to be her last to him, and he preserved it like a relic, as proof of his cousin's affection, as something to treasure. \"That was the last sign of life I had with Anne,\" Elias told me. After the war, Otto Frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate. He published Anne's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film. He created the foundation in her name in 1963. The first edition of the diary was in Dutch. Elias told me he had to wait several years for a German language edition before he could read it. That was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate. By the time he read her words, he had not seen Anne in many years. In his mind, he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the Jack-in-the-Box puppet shows Elias staged and played hide-and-seek. \"Anne,\" he said, \"was always good at hiding.\" I wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words. Otto Frank kept alive his daughter's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to Elias.  He was devoted to the task until the day he died. In 2012, he helped create the Frank Family Centre in Frankfurt, where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public, according to the Anne Frank foundation. Elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world. Anne Frank never gave up on humanity, despite everything she endured. It was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary. In Elias, I saw that same goodness.",

But even a hastily scribbled postcard can become a valuable artefact when written by Sir Paul McCartney. The greeting, sent by the Beatles star from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre, fetched almost \u00a31,000 at auction earlier this week. This postcard, featuring a Scotty dog with a tartan border and the message 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot?' was sent by Paul McCartney from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre . Posted to his London housekeeper Rose, the brief handwritten message read: 'With love from the \u201cfour Macs\u201d. Now on tour in Scotland.\u2019 Sir Paul spent weeks at his bolthole with wife Linda and daughters Heather and Mary after the band split in 1970. But he kept in touch with his London housekeeper, Rose Martin, sending a card featuring a Scotty dog, tartan, lucky white heather and the lyrics \u2018Should auld acquaintance be forgot?\u2019. A brief note on the back reads: \u2018With love from the \u201cfour Macs\u201d. Now on tour in Scotland.\u2019 With a Campbeltown postmark and an upside-down stamp, it went under the hammer in Warrington, near the band\u2019s native Liverpool, as part of a sale of Beatles memorabilia on Tuesday. Organiser Omega Auctions had valued it at between \u00a3250 and \u00a3350 \u2013 but it went for \u00a3950. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: \u2018Such intimate, personal and unique things give Beatles and Paul McCartney collectors an insight into how life was for him back then, and very rarely come up for sale.\u2019 Sir Paul spent weeks at his bolthole with wife Linda (pictured with him at the farmhouse) and daughters Heather and Mary after the band split in 1970 . Sir Paul, now 72, bought 600-acre High Park Farm on the Kintyre peninsula in 1966 at the height of The Beatles\u2019 success, while living with actress Jane Asher. He has said he was inspired to write The Beatles hit The Long And Winding Road by the estate\u2019s \u2018wandering single-track roads and sense of solace\u2019. After he married Linda Eastman in 1969, the couple turned the modest farmhouse into a holiday retreat. When the band broke up, the McCartneys headed there to get away from the limelight. The couple later immortalised their love of the area in the hit song Mull Of Kintyre, which took their band Wings to the Christmas No 1 spot in 1977. The most successful single of his solo career, it went on to sell 2.5 million copies. Sir Paul once said of the track: \u2018It was a love song, really, about how I enjoyed being there and imagining I was travelling away and wanting to get back.\u2019",

        "article": "Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 in Queensland during a fatal citizen's arrest . A chilling recording of a father-of-three crying for help has been played during a coronial inquest. Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 during a fatal citizen's arrest in Queensland. A coroner found yesterday that six people used excessive force which contributed to Mr Kumar's death\u00a0at a car park in Mooloolaba, north of Brisbane. He had earlier assaulted two people. But in a triple zero call recording posted on Sunshine Coast Daily, the 34-year-old's\u00a0urgent pleas  can be heard. 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe,' he said. But a male voice responds:\u00a0'Not our problem bud.' Brisbane Coroner John Hutton delivered his findings on Wednesday, saying that those restraining Mr Kumar had failed to release pressure on him despite his appeal. 'I find that their failure to release pressure on Mr Kumar, despite Mr Kumar's continual pleading with them that he could not breathe, fell well-short of any standard of reasonableness,' he said. 'The force they used to continue to restrain Mr Kumar in the circumstances was excessive.' The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest. A coroner found yesterday that six people used excessive force which contributed to Mr Kumar's death at a car park in Mooloolaba (pictured), north of Brisbane . The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest. The following can be heard: . A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal'; . Mr Amit Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe'; . A male voice: 'Not our problem bud'; . Ms Jodie Cassar: Where do you get off hitting women huh?'; . A male voice: 'You f***ing piece of sH**'; . Ms Cassar: 'It's because you know I can't fight ya, that's why'; and . A male voice: 'Are they on the line?'. The following can be heard: . A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal'; . Mr Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe'; . A male voice: 'Not our problem bud'. Last month's inquest heard the self-employed truck driver\u00a0assaulted two staff - including Jodie Cassar - from a fishing charter boat when he was told he couldn't join the trip because he had booked it under a false name of 'Adam Jones'. Staff and customers from the fishing charter - five men and one woman - used zip ties to restrain Mr Kumar. The coroner found he died from the combined effects of restraint, heart disease and excess weight around his stomach. A pathologist concluded that contributing factors were the position in which Mr Kumar was held, pressure on his head and neck blocking his airway, and the stress associated with his struggle. Mr Hutton said the initial decision to restrain Mr Kumar was reasonable, but the group failed to recognise the danger to his life. He singled out a doctor among the six people who, the coroner said, acted unreasonably by not taking more control over Mr Kumar's well-being. However, the coroner did not recommend anyone be prosecuted. 'I find that the actions of the people who restrained Mr Kumar contributed to his death,' he said. 'However, I am unable to quantify the level of contribution their actions had to Mr Kumar's death.' Mr Hutton did recommend that first-aid training providers consider raising awareness about the dangers of positional and restraint asphyxia.",

The 39-year-old did not reach the heights he is capable of, but was still more than good enough to get past the Scot - the man he beat to win the second of his five World Championships in 2008. Ronnie O'Sullivan was in no mood to pat himself on the back after beating\u00a0Graeme Dott . Neither man made a break of three figures and O'Sullivan missed a handful of easy-looking shots, but Dott was unable to punish him, most notably in the fourth when he missed a green off the spot as he tried to clear to level at 2-2. O'Sullivan made him pay, but was in no mood to pat himself on the back. 'Graeme has had a good tournament, been consistent and is always a tough match,' O'Sullivan told ITV4. 'We both played poorly, I felt nervous for some reason and couldn't see the wood for the trees. It was strange, one of those evenings and it was lucky Graeme played as badly as me. 'I was sitting there thinking of how good Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis were and they started twitching, and thought 'is this my time?'. I missed so many balls, it was diabolical. Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon 4-2 to book a place in the last four in\u00a0Llandudno . 'I'm just relieved, tomorrow is another day, but you want to build momentum as this stage of a tournament.' Earlier in the day, Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon to ensure O'Sullivan would avoid a collision course with his old nemesis. He called the veteran, a man who has tormented him in the past, 'Peter f****** Ebdon' in a newspaper interview this week, but Ebdon was dispatched 4-2. O'Sullivan will face Stuart Bingham in the last four after he beat Mark Davis 4-0 in a low-scoring affair.",

        "article": "(CNN)It shouldn't come as a surprise that Yemen has collapsed -- again.  A country that has split and been pulled together before, has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region, is running low on oil and water, and possesses a \"personalist\" government rather than stable institutions, was on the top of every expert's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next. What is surprising is that U.S. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists could keep Yemen intact and stable. Indeed, last fall, when President Barack Obama pointed to U.S. policy in Yemen as an example of a \"success\" and a model for the plans that would roll back the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), I shivered. For as September ended, Shi'ite Houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city, Sanaa. By January, the Islamic State was noticeably increasing its recruitment in Yemen, and that same month the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Last week, the Islamic State bombed two Shi'ite mosques in Yemen, killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer.  This week, the Houthi forces are closing in on Yemen's second major city,  Aden, on the south coast, and the U.S.-supported President, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has reportedly fled the country. As the United States has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops, Yemen has slid into total chaos, with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons. The situation is so dire that a coalition of Sunni nations, led by Saudi Arabia, has launched massive airstrikes against the Houthis, with a Saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into Yemen to restore the Hadi regime. Yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability. These include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans; a united elite; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth. Rather than working to secure these things, the U.S. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove \"dangerous elements\" will sustain broader social and political stability. Anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in Yemen and that aerial attacks on al Qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them. Those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner, while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast. What we have now is an area with about 24 million people, more than twice the population now under the rule of the Islamic State in eastern Syria and western Iraq, that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between Iran-supported Shi'as and al Qaeda/ISIS-aligned Sunnis. It is a war that the West loses no matter who wins. It is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power, or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so. Either task will be difficult, and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in Syria and Iraq. In other words, what has happened in Yemen, although predictable, is about the worst outcome imaginable for U.S. policy.  That America ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the Middle East and North Africa -- and the crisis of ISIS -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it.",

The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.",

        "article": "Triple police killer Harry Roberts has been enjoying his new life of freedom with a new identity and a state-funded bungalow. The 78-year-old, who was jailed for life for shooting dead three unarmed officers in 1966, was released on licence from Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, in November last year. After serving 48 years behind bars, the murderer has reportedly taken his new found freedom in his stride - getting the bus to the supermarket, walking in the park and visiting the gym daily. Harry Roberts (pictured left in 2009 and right in police mugshot in 1966) has changed his name and is living in a state-funded bungalow following his release from prison in November last year . The pensioner has to check in with authorities twice a day but is otherwise free to come and go as he pleases, The Sun reports. He has been seen out and about wearing a pair of sunglasses and using his pension to buy bacon and tinned peaches. A local who recognised him told the paper: 'Nobody has a clue who he is - but he looks like the cat who got the cream. 'He is wandering around completely unchecked, joking with locals who would be horrified if they knew his real identity.' They also claim that his three neighbours at the bungalow - where he has his own living area - have no idea who he is. Harry Fletcher,\u00a0a former senior official in the probation officers\u2019 union NAPO, said it costs taxpayers about \u00a325,000 a year to keep Roberts at the hostel, which is staffed 24 hours a day. Roberts, 78, pictured on a previous day release from Sudbury prison in Derby . He is also entitled to draw the basic state pension \u2013 \u00a3113 per week \u2013 taking the overall bill to the taxpayer to around \u00a331,000. Mr Fletcher said: 'Because of his notoriety, risk and age, they have put him in an \"approved premise\" - pretty much a bail hostel. 'He wasn't deemed a risk to the public or to himself but the risk is that people in the community would recognise him, although that risk was deemed low as he hasn't really been photographed recently. 'However given these recent revelations the chances are he will now have to be moved to another accommodation.' He explained that the typical stay in one of these hostels is between three and six months and after that the authorities would ensure he gets another form of sheltered accommodation. 'During the day he will be unrestricted. He will be subject to some form of curfew - probably about 9pm and then he will stay in the hostel until around 7ish the next morning. 'He will report to the\u00a0probation\u00a0service weekly and there will be staff in the hostel he will see daily. If he is deemed to be coping okay this will be reduced to fortnightly and then monthly. He is on a life licence so he will need to do that for the rest of his life.' He added: 'Someone that has been in prison that long will be\u00a0institutionalised and so they would have considered keeping him in an open prison but as he didn't pose a risk to the public he was put in a bail hostel.' Roberts was jailed for life for the murders of Det Sgt Christopher Head, 30, Det Con David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, in West London in 1966. Despite the heinous nature of his crime, for which he has never expressed any remorse, Roberts was allowed out on temporary release back in 2001. Roberts had lost his bid to be granted parole in 2009 after he threatened and intimidated Joan Cartwright, her husband Peter and her son James, who had given Roberts work at their animal sanctuary while he was on day release. Unarmed victims (from left): PC Geoffrey Fox, DC David Wombwell and DS Christopher Head were all shot dead . Investigation: Police officers search the murderers' car following the killings on August 12, 1966 . He had threatened to kill the couple after she complained about his behaviour, and he rang her from prison up to five times a week after learning she had given evidence against him. Several attacks were also carried out on her animals at the East Midlands sanctuary. Before their relationship broke down in July 2001, around his 65th birthday, staff at the sanctuary arranged a secret birthday party and even arranged for a birthday cake and champagne. Roberts, Duddy and Witney were sitting in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison on August 12, 1966, planning an armed robbery with a Luger pistol. They were approached by the three plain clothes unarmed police officers who\u00a0had suspected there had been a jail escape. Roberts\u00a0shot at the policemen in Braybrook Street while children were playing nearby. He killed Det Con Wombell and chased and shot Sergeant Head. One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox. Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison. His two accomplices are now both dead.\u00a0Duddy died in Parkhurst prison in 1981 and Witney was released in 1991 but was beaten to death with a hammer by his flatmate in Bristol in 1999. He also received presents of aftershave and socks reportedly made a toast saying 'Here's to freedom... I cannot believe the Home Secretary let me out'. Around that time he was also treated to a night out 10-pin bowling at the Hollywood Bowl centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Mrs Cartwright, 71, is said to be 'sickened' by the revelations. Roberts was found guilty of three murders after a trial for what the judge described as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more'. He had been sitting with his accomplices John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London. The trio had been preparing for an armed robbery when they were approached by the officers and Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on the three unarmed officers. Roberts shot dead two of the policemen, DS Head and DC Wombwell, and DC Fox was killed by Duddy. His accomplices were caught but Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days relying on his training as a soldier to survive. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. He was later found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. On November 15, 1966, Roberts was given three life sentences with a 30 year minimum tariff. He went on to become on of Britain's longest serving prisoners.",

And once again it was the first leg that cost him. Arsenal were knocked out in France on away goals, a 2-0 away win failing to make up for a catastrophic 3-1 loss at The Emirates. Their players know the history. 'We say same thing every year,\u2019 complained defender Laurent Koscielny. 'Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right - play well in two games.' Arsene Wenger vents his frustration on the sideline as Arsenal fall a goal short in their 2-0 win over Monaco . Aaron Ramsey made an immediate impact off the bench and scored but couldn't help the Gunners advance . Monaco celebrate advancing to the Champions League quarter finals as Arsenal fall again in the last 16 . Aaron Ramsey concurred: \u2018We\u2019ve always gone out to Bayern Munich and Barcelona at this stage but no disrespect to Monaco, we thought we\u2019d have a good opportunity to qualify. But we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg. It\u2019s nearly again, but it\u2019s not enough.\u2019 After losing 4-3 on aggregate to Barcelona in 2011 \u2013 beating them 2-1 in the first leg before losing 3-1 at the Nou Camp - Arsenal's first leg travails have hurt them every 12 months. Andrey Arshavin is ecstatic after scoring the winner for Arsenal in their 2011 first leg win over Barcelona . Lionel Messi is swamped by his Barcelona team-mates as his penalty wins their place in the 2011 quarters . Barca overcame the 2-1 loss to Arsenal in the first leg to defeat the Gunners and advance with a 3-1 victory . 2012 . AC Milan 4 Arsenal 0; Arsenal 3 AC Milan 0 . (AC Milan win 4-3 on aggregate) Arsenal were a shambles in the San Siro as Kevin-Prince Boateng, Robinho (two) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (from the penalty spot) tore them apart. Incredibly, Arsene Wenger's men clawed back three of the goals in the first half at The Emirates through Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and Robin van Persie (penalty) but still couldn't force extra-time with Robin van Persie missing from close range. Where did it all go wrong? Fans will remember the Van Persie miss (perhaps coloured by the player's subsequent exit), but it was the mental collapse in the first leg that cost Arsenal. The first goal was spectacular, if avoidable, but the other three were brutally poor defending. Against a decent, but not world-beating attack, the likes of Johan Djourou proved they didn't belong. Kevin-Prince Boateng laces in the opener as AC Milan demolish Arsenal 4-0 in their last-16 first leg in 2012 . Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the icing on the cake from the penalty spot after two goal from Robinho . Arsenal fell short in the return leg at The Emirates with Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and Robin van Persie (penalty) striking . 2013 . Arsenal 1 Bayern Munich 3; Bayern Munich 0 Arsenal 2 . 3-3 on aggregate. Bayern Munich win on away goals . Exactly the same set of results as this week. Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern a seemingly unassailable first leg lead, only for Arsenal to come so close to an astonishing comeback in Germany with goals from Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny. Bayern ended up winning the Champions League . Where did it all go wrong? It's a little harsh to criticise a defeat against Europe's best side, but Arsenal were naive in the first leg. Having weathered a Bayern storm, and found a way back into the tie at 2-1, the Gunners committed too many men forward, and conceded a sloppy third. Toni Kroos celebrates after firing Bayern ahead with a powerful volley from the edge of the box . Wojciech Szczesny tries to scramble the ball away, but Arsenal conceded a sloppy, and crucial, third . Olivier Giroud gave Arsene Wenger's side hope with a third minute goal in Munich to spark a second leg fight . After Laurent Koscielny added a second five minutes from time the players tried to get the ball back to restart . 2014 . Arsenal 0 Bayern Munich 2; Bayern Munich 1 Arsenal 1 . Bayern win 3-1 on aggregate . Pep Guardiola's side effectively settled the tie at The Emirates with Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos on target after Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the first half for a foul on Arjen Robben in the box. Once again Arsenal battled back once they had little to play for and the pressure was off and Lukasz Podolski scored to give Wenger's men a deserved draw in the Olympic Stadium as they chased a shock victory. Where did it all go wrong? Mesut Ozil's missed penalty was the turning point. Before that point they had bossed the game against the European champions. It took the wind out of their sails, and Bayern eventually produced their magic. Wojchiech Szczesny brings down Arjen Robben, as Bayern once again sealed a first-leg lead . The Arsenal keeper's red card left Wenger's side to compete with one a Europe's best sides a man down . For a second year in a row Toni Kroos (right) was on target at the Emirates stadium, and the tie was all but over . 2015 . Arsenal 1 Monaco 3; Monaco 0 Arsenal 2 . 3-3 on aggregate (Monaco win on away goals) Arsenal keep finding new ways to cock it up. Against the weakest opposition left, Arsenal conceded a killer third goal in injury-time at The Emirates. It meant they had to score three in Monaco, they managed two and wasted a hatful of chances. Hurtfully, the languid Dimitar Berbatov said Monaco had 'wanted it more' than Arsenal in the first leg. Dimitar Berbatov celebrates scoring Monaco's second, but Arsenal managed to get back into the tie . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's strike made it 2-1, before the young midfielder made a fatal error late on . VIDEO\u00a0Monaco deserved to go out - Wenger . Where did it all go wrong? For all the shambles in the first 91 minutes of the first leg, Arsenal were back in the tie when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a stoppage-time goal to make it 2-1. For an unimaginable reason, however, they continued to attack all-out, and with nine men ahead of the ball, gave up a shocking third. However wonderful the effort in the second leg, the task was always likely to be too great. Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil look dejected as the tie slips away from Arsenal in the first leg yet again .",

But India plays its supporting role with equal charm and grace. Painted elephants, marble palaces, magnificent forts, wandering cows, pale pink turbans and flickering candles tell of the noise, smells and rich colours of this flamboyant country. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was filmed in amid the beautiful backdrop of Jaipur in Rajasthan . Filmed in Rajasthan, the film is based in its capital, Jaipur. But ask any resident of the city about the film and you'll be met with a blank stare. Our wonderful guide, Rajendra, was aware of it only because a client had pointed out 'the apparently very famous Judi Dench' in the Rambagh Palace Hotel. Bollywood not Hollywood still rules the screens here. While it might be too late to see Richard Gere in the crowded alleyways of the bazaars, you will spot plenty of other desirable items. Jaipur is a shopper's paradise and Indians flock here for silks and the region's hand-made, block-printed cottons. The magnificent Amber Fort, to which you can ride on an elephant, offers panoramic views over Maota Lake and the ornamental gardens that seem to float within . This is also considered the place to come for jewels. The stones are not mined here, but cut, polished and set better than anywhere else. Visit the iconic jeweller of Jaipur, the Gem Palace, one-time court jewellers to the Mughal emperors and run by the Kasliwal family since 1852. Here are ruby chandelier earrings, enamel rings with floral mughal designs and moonstone necklaces. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is every bit as starry as the first film, with Judi Dench (pic), Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and Richard Gere centre stage . You can watch them being worked on in their basement workshop, using skills that have been passed down the generations. For inexpensive sparkle, head to Bangle Lane (Maniharon ka Rasta) in the old city, where you can choose from a multitude of colourful lac bangles for a handful of rupees. Made from resin produced by the female lac insect, they are embedded with mirror pieces, stones, beads or painted. For fashion, Hot Pink is the most sophisticated venue, with high-collared men's waistcoats and moccasins in all hues, as well as kaftans and shawls. The best block-printed fabrics, a craft that dates back to the 1700s, are at Riddhi Siddhi, where cloth is piled from floor to ceiling. Wander, too, through the spice market, past paan wallahs filling betel leaves and the flower market, where scented roses, fragrant jasmine and marigolds are made into garlands to offer to your favourite deities. The Pink City is so-called for its coloured wash, intended to replicate Indian sandstone, a more noble material than the lime and mortar of which the buildings are actually made. With its city gates and crenellated walls, it makes for a striking sight. There are iconic landmarks, such as the five-storey, 18th-century Palace of the Winds, with its latticed screen facade allowing street life to be viewed by the veiled ladies within. Before 1727, when Sawai Jai Singh II created Jaipur, the City of Victory, neighbouring Amber, was the capital. Our wonderful guide, Rajendra, was aware of it only because a client had pointed out 'the apparently very famous Judi Dench' in the Rambagh Palace Hotel (pictured) The magnificent Amber Fort, to which you can ride on an elephant, offers panoramic views over Maota Lake and the ornamental gardens that seem to float within. The 16th and 17th-century interiors impress with their exquisitely carved silver doors, ceilings of alabaster and an Indian version of the Hall of Mirrors with mirrored fragments embedded in vaulted ceilings glinting between arches. Today, the Jaipur royal family live in the City Palace, where rooms are open to the public. Filmed in Rajasthan, the film is based in its capital, Jaipur and stars Judi Dench (pictured), but India plays its supporting role with equal charm and grace . Gone is their Rambagh Palace, which became India's first palace hotel in 1957 (do try its Suvarna Mahal restaurant). But their newly elegant Rajmahal Palace has recently been re-opened. Dating back to 1829, this was once the British residency and later home to the polo-playing Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II, who entertained the Queen, Lord Mountbatten, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Jacqueline Kennedy. Their names adorn some of the 14 suites in the palace's new chapter as a hotel managed by Sujan Luxury. The first first film follows a group of elderly character as they explore their respective retirement plans in India and fall in love with the beautiful landscape in the process . The decor, by acclaimed designer Adil Ahmad, offers vivid turquoises and shocking pinks, gilded mirrors and sweeping marble staircases - but, sadly, not Richard Gere. TRAVEL FACTS .

Brook was left needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after an unprovoked attack in Tenerife last year but is now suitably prepared to defend his IBF welterweight championship on his hometown return at the Sheffield Motorpoint Arena on Saturday. And Britain's most recent world champion showed off his scars in the ring as he counts down the days to his comeback appearance against Romanian mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan. Kell Brook is ready to return to the ring against Jo Jo Dan just six months after he suffered a machete attack . Brook showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack (left) before putting in more hours ahead of his return . Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, or that he would be unable to walk ever again . Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, with blood spurting from his leg - and later admitted that he believed that he may not have been able to walk again. Now, once Brook has completed the first step in his comeback, he intends to take on the winner of May's Mayweather-Pacquiao contest after watching them go head-to-head at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. He has ruled out fighting fellow Brit Amir Khan in order to focus on facing the winner of the fight of the century. Brook says a fight with Amir Khan is not appealing to him now, and he wants to take on a 'massive name' The damage to Brook's leg did not seem to phase the Sheffield fighter as he showed off his skipping skills . Saturday's fight with Jo Jo Dan marks Brooks' return to the right, and he looks in good shape for his comeback . Brook seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on Tuesday afternoon . 'I think the Amir Khan fight is gone for this year,' Brook said. 'I'm the world champion and I will fight some other massive name. I'm not interested in what he does next now. 'It makes sense to do a unification fight. No contact has been made yet with either of them (Mayweather or Pacquiao) and I'm just focusing on my mandatory challenge at the moment, but I want to be involved in the big fights.' Brook had previously talked up the chances of fighting Khan at Wembley Stadium but with all eyes on the Mayweather-Pacquiao contest, which Brook will be attending, his attention has been diverted elsewhere. 'I want Mayweather,' he said. 'I want the best pound-for-pound fighter that everyone has titled him as. I want to fight the very best - I'm in my prime, I'm unbeaten, I'm world champion.' Brook had won his world title with a win over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles just weeks before the attack . After returning home, Brook poses for a photo with his belt and strapped-up leg during a Sportsmail interview . The attack left Brook needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after blood was 'spurting everywhere' out of it .",

The incident occurred at a Chevron in Fort Worth about 5.30am. CCTV shows a red Toyota quickly pulling up outside the station, with a man jumping out of the car and bolting inside. Covered in blood and pleading for help, the victim told the gas station clerk to call 911. CCTV: Footage from the\u00a0Chevron in the 1000 block of Bridgewood Drive in Fort Worth show the victim quickly pulling up in his red Toyota, leaving the car running as he ran inside . 'Help': The man comes running into the gas station, covered in blood, pleading for assistance . Badly injured: The footage shows the man, with an obvious injury around his mouth . 911: The victim asked the gas station clerk to call for help, and he then went back outside . The man had been shot in the face. Judging by the footage, the bullet hit him around the mouth area. However, according to NBC DFW, rather than attend to the wound, he waited outside for the police and ambulance to arrive. Then, once help arrived, the victim refused to cooperate.

She had waited for him while he served in the army. They had two children, a dog and a vegetable garden. But their  love story took a tragic turn last Thursday as the couple walked across a shopping center to meet high school friends for their monthly lunch reunion. WWII veteran Clark Biddle died a hero after pushing Betty, his wife of 68 years, out of the way from an oncoming car. They were high school sweethearts in Columbus, Ohio . Betty had broken her hip two years ago, and was relying on her husband and a walker to help her move that day. When Clark saw that she was in danger as a car began backing out of a parking space, he didn't hesitate. Betty was bruised, but Clark had been struck. He fell and hit his head, suffering massive brain trauma. He passed away two days later. 'I don't know if I'm going to make it without him,' Betty told the Columbus Dispatch. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day'. She said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day' Betty said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground and that sometimes she wishes she was with him . 'Sometimes I wish I was with him, I really do,' she said. Gary Biddle, the couple's son, said his father was acting on instinct when he saved Betty. He had been her primary caregiver ever since her injury two years ago. 'This is dad, he would sacrifice himself for others and always cared for them, more than thinking about himself,' he told the Columbus Dispatch. Clark was a pilot. He also opened and owned a drive-in restaurant bearing his name for 25 years, and played the saxophone and clarinet for dance bands. He was a well-known member of his community, unable to go to the grocery store without running into people he knew, according to his son-in-law Dan Cress. Clark was also a friendly neighbor. Laura Jones told the Columbus Dispatch that he would let her dog out every day while she was at work after her husband died six years ago. And, without fail, there was always a note and two cookies  waiting for her when she got home. Columbus police said the driver of the car is currently under investigation.",

        "article": "Jonny Evans has grudgingly accepted the six-match ban imposed on him by the FA for spitting at Papiss Cisse. There is no right of appeal for the Manchester United defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing Monday's FA Cup quarter-final with Arsenal. Though he maintains that he did not spit at the Newcastle United striker, the FA found Evans guilty and confirmed in a statement: \u2018Mr Evans denied the charge but it was found proven.\u2019 Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. The incident, during United\u2019s 1-0 win at St James\u2019 Park on Wednesday, was not seen by referee Anthony Taylor or his assistants, but was caught on TV. A three-man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on Thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off, prompting the FA to bring a charge. An independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned. Cisse, 29, pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident. He is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in December for elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman. By contrast, Evans, 27, had denied the charge on Thursday, saying: \u2018I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.\u2019 Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Arsenal (h), Monday (FA Cup quarter-final) Tottenham (h),\u00a0March 15\u00a0(Premier League) Liverpool (a), March 22\u00a0(Premier League) Aston Villa (h), April 4\u00a0(Premier League) Man City (h)\u00a0April 12\u00a0(Premier League) Chelsea (a) April 18\u00a0(Premier League) The FA also looked at an incident where Evans was alleged to have spat in the direction of Emmanuel Riviere during the game but that was dismissed. Evans will potentially miss any FA Cup semi-final should United progress plus their Premier League games against Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City. If United were to lose on Monday, Evans would then miss the trip to Chelsea and would not return until United\u2019s Premier League trip to Everton on April 26. United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA - one less than Newcastle striker Cisse . There is no right of appeal so Evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel . 1. The Association may act against a Participant in respect of any 'Misconduct', which is . defined as being a breach of the following: . (a) the Laws of the Game; . (b) the Rules and Regulations of The Association and in particular Rules E3 to 28 below; . (c) the Statutes and Regulations of UEFA; . (d) the Statutes and Regulations of FIFA; . (e) the rules or regulations of an Affiliated Association or Competition; . (f) an order, requirement, direction or instruction of The Association. That would be a blow for United manager Louis van Gaal, who insisted ahead of the Cup clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford that the main priority for United this season must be to qualify for the Champions League. United haven\u2019t won the FA Cup since 2004 and haven\u2019t landed any silverware since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but the Dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the club\u2019s primary objective. \u2018I always want to get the goals we have set. And the goal we have set is the top four,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League, which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.\u2019 Cisse was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing  Seamus Coleman in December .",

In between there is a brief period where the sun does set and rise - and this is the first sunset of 2015. Scroll down for video . The British Antarctic Survey research station on the Brunt ice shelf witnesses this year\u2019s first sunset over Antarctica . Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. As the south pole moves from 24-hour daylight towards gradual darkness, the British Antarctic Survey research station on the Brunt ice shelf witnesses this year\u2019s first sunset over Antarctica . For the crew of the French\u2013Italian Halley research station in Antarctica, it means isolation is coming. They are about to be 'locked in' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation. To make things worse, four months will be in darkness because the Sun never rises above the horizon. Called Halley VI, it is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym. A vacuum drainage system keeps water . consumption down, and the ski-clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres . (13 feet) above the level of the ice. The inside of the centre has been . been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the . summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter, when . temperatures at the base drop as low as -56C. It has triple-glazed windows and a . quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to . contemplate the Antarctic environment in peace. This year, ESA-sponsored medical doctor Beth Healey will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long-duration missions to explore our Solar System. 'Living in Concordia is similar in many ways to living in space, where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure \u2013 Concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level,' says the European Space Agency. 'From searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters, Beth will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform Antarctic science for the French and Italian polar institutes.' Called Halley VI, the lab is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. ESA signed an agreement this month with the British Antarctic Survey to perform two of the five Concordia experiments at their Halley VI station. If this pilot season runs well, ESA will extend the cooperation. Concordia offers ESA scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes. The crew at Halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level. Performing the same investigations at Halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data: air pressure. Over the next six months, volunteers at Halley and Concordia will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored. This is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut\u2019s state of mind. The Halley VI centre, a dismantlable research station created for the . British Antarctic Survey by British architects Hugh Broughton, was . nominated for  the World Architecture Festival Awards 2013 . Ask anybody how they feel and most will reply \u2018fine\u2019 but, for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking, having an objective second-opinion could be a lifesaver. The system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar, as well as charting how often people talk to each other, to develop an idea of how people feel. The second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting. Concordia sunset . David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey\u2019s director of science, concludes: \u201cWe are committed to supporting excellent science in Antarctica in all disciplines. We are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for, perhaps, the biggest adventure in history, a manned flight to Mars.\u201d Click here for a full list of ESA\u2019s research at Concordia this year and follow the Concordia blog for updates from the station.

Despite coming within two points of winning the title last season, the Reds initially struggled this term after losing Luis Suarez and bringing in a raft of new signings - losing four of their opening five league games. However, Liverpool have been the form team of 2015, winning seven and drawing two of their league games to challenge for a Champions League place while reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Kolo Toure (left) trains ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Blackburn on Sunday . The defender insists he always knew Brendan Rodgers would come good for Liverpool this season . Toure has hailed 'intelligent' Rodgers for making Liverpool the Premier League form team of 2015 . Speaking to The Independent, Toure said: I'm not surprised by the turn around because the manager is great, really intelligent in working out problems. 'He pays attention to every detail, tries different things, pushes players so you don't get lazy. We had a lot of new players coming in, especially young ones from abroad who had to settle in. 'I moved to England when I was 21 so i know it takes time to fit in, to learn. I knew that eventually it would all come together, and that is what the boss kept telling us as well.' Liverpool face Blackburn Rovers on Sunday for a chance of boosting their season even further by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals . Toure, who has returned from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, could become the first player in history to win the FA Cup with three different clubs, having already collected the trophy with Arsenal (2003, 2005) and Manchester City (2011). Toure could become the first player to win the FA Cup with three clubs, having won it with Arsenal (above) and Manchester City previously . The 33-year-old celebrates winning the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast in February . Although the 33-year-old has been used as a substitute in Liverpool's last two games, he understands that he is not guaranteed playing time at Anfield. 'When you're with a big team like Liverpool, you can't expect to start every game, especially because I was a way with the Ivory Coast for almost a month. 'But I am always ready to contribute whether it is on the pitch or in the dressing room. We have a team that's hungry for success, with exciting young players that I help guide with experience. The winning mentality is really, really strong.'",

Pebble launched the Kickstarter campaign to fund its latest device, called Time (pictured), on the last day of February and in just 28 days it raised $20.3 million (\u00a313.7 million) from 78,471 backers . The Californian firm also used the momentum of the campaign to launch a scheme hoping to encourage designers to build their own 'smartstraps' for its new watch. It will pay up to \u00a3637,000 ($1 million) to help develop the best designs and has unveiled a prototype example that can turn the watch into a standalone device. This strap, designed by Spark.io, features a 'cellular development kit' meaning the watch can connect directly to a mobile network. It is just a prototype at the moment, and the exact functionality hasn't been revealed, but this would reduce the Pebble Time's reliance on a connected phone, for example. Another example strap presented by Pebble is Seeed Studio\u2019s  modular strap that lets wearers add different functions. The new Time smartwatch (pictured) comes with a colour e-paper screen similar to the technology used on e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle, with Pebble promising up to seven days battery life as a result.

        "article": "(CNN)It's a controversial question that's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as Jihadi John. Was Mohammed Emwazi, the man with a British accent who's appeared in numerous ISIS beheading videos, pushed toward extremism by authorities? Or was he someone who'd long been heading down a militant path? A London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. And a report from the Daily Mail, also citing emails purportedly sent from Emwazi to the British publication, said the Kuwait-born Londoner saw himself as a \"dead man walking\" and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups. \"You can't start the story at how he's been treated by UK officials. You certainly can't start the story from the email trail,\" said Rashad Ali, director at the counterextremism consultancy CENTRI and a fellow of the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. \"You have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him. Well, because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join Al-Shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in Somalia.\" Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE, the human rights and Muslim advocacy organization that worked with him. One email details Emwazi's account of his detention at a British airport, when authorities stopped him from traveling to Kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours. \"I told them that I want to be left alone, as I have an ambition of moving from the UK and settling in Kuwait. That is why I found a job and a spouse!! But they laughed,\" Emwazi wrote in a message dated June 3, 2010. \"One of them got aggressive with me, he pushed me to the wall. ... I was just baffled I did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview, fingerprinting and searching. When I asked for their names they said 'We don't give out our names.' \" Emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by British security and intelligence officials reminded him \"of criminals that you see on TV who have committed a serious crime, only I was a person never charged or arrested for anything. I was a person looking to start a new life in my country Kuwait!\" That's a key detail, CAGE spokesman Amandla Thomas-Johnson said. \"If someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way, then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them,\" he said. \"In the UK, he wasn't arrested once, prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever.\" British authorities have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on the case. In the emails, Emwazi pleaded for CAGE's help. \"Please help me as I don't want to stay in the UK because I have found a Job in Kuwait, found a spouse in Kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in Kuwait. Kuwait is where I'm from, I was born their. I just want to go their and start my new life again!!\" Emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the Independent Police Complaints Commission, before going into detail about how he was apparently \"assaulted by the police officer\" as he attempted to leave for Kuwait. But it was a difficult complaint to prove, Thomas-Johnson said. \"The IPCC says there's no camera in the room where this took place, so we can't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer,\" he said.  \"These things happen in the shadows and the dark. So it is very difficult to independently verify once it's taken place. There isn't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability.\" Details from court papers reported in British media paint a different picture. They say Emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the \"North London Boys\" who allegedly funneled money and recruits to Al-Shabaab. The Guardian has reported that Emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed London bomb attacks in 2005. To British authorities, his face was a familiar one for more than five years. But authorities lost track of him in 2013, according to friends. He changed his name and made his way to Syria. Analysts who've studied ISIS recruiting say they aren't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned Emwazi into \"Jihadi John.\" \"I think it's an absurd claim,\" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. \"It was not the cause of his radicalization. The reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the Shabaab in Somalia.\" Ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism. \"People do not turn around, when harassed and have grievances, and become terrorists,\" he said. In addition to the emails released by CAGE, another series of emails from Emwazi came to light over the weekend. The messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the Daily Mail's security editor, Robert Verkaik. The Daily Mail published excerpts from those exchanges, including Emwazi's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website, but only stated his surname. When he met a potential buyer at a London underground station, he says the person he met shook his hand and said \"nice doing business with you Mohammed.\" \"I NEVER TOLD THIS PERSON MY FIRST NAME!!\" wrote Emwazi to Verkaik. \"& I NEVER GIVE OUT MY FIRST NAME!! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KNOW MY FIRST NAME!!\" He also hinted at suicidal thoughts. \"Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me. \"Rather, fearing that one day, I'll take as many pills as I can so that I can sleep for ever!! I just want to get away from these people!!!\" Verkaik said he met Emwazi in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence. Emwazi's concerns bordered on paranoia, Verkaik wrote, and he desperately wanted his story to be told. \"Like many young Muslim men at the time, he appeared to have a grievance. But this man was different,\" Verkaik wrote. \"In him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in Syria.\" CNN's Brian Todd and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.",

Kemeys Folly, in Langstone, near Newport in South Wales, starred in the popular Channel 4 programme six years ago when it was converted into a six-bedroom luxury house - and now owners Sarah and Dean Berry have put the unusual property up for sale. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of a castellated 18th Century hunting lodge with the construction of a state of-the-art glass extension. Scroll down for video . Kemeys Folly (pictured) starred in popular property show Grand Designs six years ago. Its owners have now put the unusual home up for sale . Owners Sarah and Dean Berry have now put the unusual Grade II listed six-bedroom home up for sale for \u00a31,999,950 . The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of the old hunting lodge with a state of-the-art glass extension . The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the tower in 2005, which was being sold by a couple who had quickly realised that there was far too much work to do, and put it back on the market. Work on Kemeys started in January 2007 and over the next year an old extension was demolished, the outside of the tower was re-pointed and the inside was stripped as much as the building's listed status would allow. Now, The Grade II listed home boasts six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms - and including a master bedroom which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. Sitting in 23 acres of land the property also boasts a cinema room in the older part of the building and outside there is a large pool house with swimming pool and changing facilities. The folly also has four stables which back directly onto a paddock. The glass extension takes full advantage of the stunning hilltop location - on a clear day you can see 11 counties as well as the two Severn road bridges and the Bristol Channel. The owners say the surrounding woodland is perfect for long walks, and which features lots of wildlife, including deer. Something of a local landmark, the original building was a hunting lodge dating back to the 1700s and was at one point owned by the Sheriff of Monmouth. The folly is situated in the heart of the Usk Valley in South Wales and has a roof terrace which enjoys this view over the  countryside . The house boasts a master bedroom and en suite which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace . It was struck by lightning in 1890, rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and was eventually converted into a house for the Sheriff of Monmouth . The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the folly in 2005 and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it and bringing it up to scratch . Mrs Berry said: 'We bought it with a view to carrying out significant work on it, renovating the tower and extending it. 'It was one of those love at first sight moments. We were in London at the time but knew we wanted to move back here to where we grew up. 'Neither of us even knew it existed but when we saw it we wanted it. It was just outstanding.' The couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with. She said: 'The idea was to keep the original features of the main building, such as the beautiful exposed stonework, but not to mimic what was already there in the extension. 'We wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century. 'Living here has been such fun.' A former hunting lodge, the folly was built in 1712 by local landowner George Kemeys. It was struck by lightning in the late 1890s, partially rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and converted into a house for TE Watson, the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. The couple are selling as they are downsizing but say: 'Whoever takes Kemeys Folly on now is going to enjoy such an amazing life here.' The house is for sale for \u00a31,999,950 with Chewton Rose.

        "article": "An Iraqi man who fled to America to escape the horrors of the Islamic State was shot dead as he took pictures of the first snowfall he had ever seen. Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, and his new wife moved from Iraq to Dallas, Texas, 20 days ago to be near relatives and start married life in a 'safer place'. But on Wednesday night, at 11.30pm, a group of men armed with rifles appeared outside the couple's apartment and opened fire, striking Al-Jumaili in the chest, police said. Authorities are investigating the possibility Al-Jumaili was the victim of a hate crime. Scroll down for video . Al-Jumaili: Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was fatally shot outside of his Texas apartment while taking pictures of his first snowfall . Wife: Al-Jumaili, his wife, Zahara (photographed), and Al-Jumaili's brother went outside of his Dallas apartment to take pictures of the snow around 11.30pm when tragedy struck . In a detailed account of the incident posted on Facebook\u00a0by Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, described the attack. Salem writes that Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when a group of five or six young African Americans opened fire. A bullet pierced through the truck and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest, Salem said. 'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' Residents reported seeing two to four men entering the Walnut Blend Apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate prior to the shooting, CNN reports. An investigation is ongoing and police say it is unknown whether the incident was a hate crime. Reunited: After a year of separation, Al-Jumaili (right) and Zahara (left) reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America . Refuge: Al-Jumaili (right) and Zahara (left) married just 16 months ago, and the two planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State . A LaunchGood\u00a0fundraising page tells the touching story of Al-Jumaili and Zahara. The two married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State. Zahara relocated to Texas to be with family and Al-Jumaili stayed behind in Baghdad to save enough money to follow his wife. After a year of separation, the two reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America. Salem wrote on Facebook that only Al-Jumaili's stepfather, who lives in Dallas, is working and Al-Jumaili's death has left Zahara with not only an emotional burden, but a financial one as well. The fundraiser has raised more than $9,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. Truck:\u00a0Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest . Police say they have very little to go on in the investigation and are enlisting the help of the public to solve the crime. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. The attack has some Muslim activists shaken up, the Los Angeles Times\u00a0reports, with some pointing to the recent murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population, according to the Times, and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees.",

Rose was called into the squad after Luke Shaw withdrew on Saturday with a hamstring problem. But the left-back has now been sent back to his club with an injury of his own. Tottenham defender Danny Rose (centre) has withdrawn from the England squad to face Lithuania . Rose puts in a strong challenge on Leicester striker\u00a0Leonardo Ulloa during Tottenham's 4-3 win on Saturday . An FA statement released on Wednesday night read: 'Tottenham Hotspur's Danny Rose has withdrawn from the England camp through injury. 'The left-back will play no further part in preparation for the forthcoming fixtures against Lithuania and Italy and has returned to his club.' After enjoying a good season with Tottenham, Rose was in line to make his England debut in either the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday or the friendly in Italy four days later. Rose was called into the squad after Luke Shaw (right) withdrew on Saturday with a hamstring problem . But the 24-year-old is now back at Spurs having become the fifth player to pull out of the international double-header since Roy Hodgson announced his squad last week. Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw withdrew on Saturday and they were followed on Monday by Liverpool pair Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana. But Everton's Leighton Baines now looks set to start at left-back in both matches, provided he does not sustain an injury against Lithuania at Wembley. That there has been no replacement called up for Rose comes as something of a surprise as Ryan Bertrand has been enjoying a good season with Southampton.",

Former nurse Jill said Mr Farage \u2018probably didn\u2019t realise it\u2019 but had been \u2018sent to protect us against the EU\u2019. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage this morning insisted he was not the 'Messiah', adding: 'I'm a very naughty boy' The 59-year old dominatrix, from Poole in Dorset, told the Channel 5 documentary \u2018Farage Fans and Ukip Lovers\u2019 that Brussels wanted to install microchips in everyone \u2013 and would send people to the guillotine if they refused. She said Mr Farage, 50, was Britain\u2019s only hope. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection.' Jill added: 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Played the clip on LBC this morning Mr Farage insisted he was not placed on Earth to save Britain from Brussels. In Monty Python's Life of Brian, the hapless Brian, played by Graham Chapman (right), is hailed the Messiah - but his mother, played by Terry Jones (left) tells his followers: 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' The cult 1979 film follows the rise of Brian Cohen, who was born on the same day as Jesus and is mistaken as the Messiah . He said: \u2018Jill, I\u2019m sure, is an absolutely delightful woman, but I have to disappoint her. Jill, I\u2019m not the Messiah, I\u2019m a very naughty boy.\u2019 Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage. 'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.' Jill, pictured left at her home in Poole, believes UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been sent from God to save us from a foreign invasion . Jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful Brits can now be more open about their sex lives . The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself. 'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said. 'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'",

        "article": "The former first lady of the Ivory Coast was today jailed for 20 years for 'undermining state security' during post-election violence in 2010-2011 that left nearly 3,000 dead. Simone Gbagbo, the wife of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo\u00a0was also accused of 'organising armed gangs' after her husband rejected results of the 2010 presidential elections. The court 'unanimously' condemned her to 20 years in jail, court president Tahirou Dembele said. Ivory Coast's former first lady Simone Gbagbo arrives at the Court of Justice in Abidjan last month during her trial for 'attempting to undermine the security of the state' in events leading to 2010-2011 electoral bloodshed . Gbagbo's face hardened as the verdict was read. She was 'a little affected' by the sentence, her lawyer Me Rodrigue Dadje told AFP. 'I am ashamed of Ivorian justice,' he said, adding that they would appeal the sentence. 'We showed that impunity in Ivory Coast must not continue,' said state prosecutor Soungalo Coulibaly. Laurent Gbagbo's son Michel, a French-born dual national from a previous marriage, was also sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the violence. Once referred to by admirers and opponents alike as Ivory Coast's 'Iron Lady,' Simone Gbagbo has been on trial since January with 82 co-defendants accused of varying degrees of involvement in the deadly unrest. A key issue in her trial was whether she played a part in directing the death squads that ran amok in the weeks after the disputed vote. Prosecutors had asked for a lighter 10-year jail term for the 65-year-old Gbagbo. 'Simone Gbagbo most certainly participated in the composition of armed gangs,' state prosecutor Simon Yabo Odi told the court, adding 'her men... participated in an insurrectional movement.' Relatives of victims of the 2010-2011 post-electoral violence in Ivory Coast protest last month in front of the Palace of Justice in Abidjan as they call for the  sentencing of the former first lady Simone Gbagbo . The previous day, the former first lady gave testimony for nearly four hours, confronting witnesses who said they'd seen her distributing arms to youths in Abidjan with flat denials. She told the court that she 'forgives' her accusers, saying: 'I have suffered humiliation on humiliation during this trial. 'But I am ready to forgive... because if we do not forgive, the country faces a crisis worse than what we experienced.' She also said she did not 'know exactly what the concrete actions are that I am being accused of', and insisted her husband had legitimately won the 2010 election. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in months of post-election violence, which was halted by the intervention of international forces acting under a UN mandate and led by former colonial power France. The son of Ivory Coast's former President Laurent Gbagbo, Michel Gbagbo (right), and former Ivorian Foreign Minister Alcide Djedje (left) arrive at the Court of Justice in Abidjan, on March 9 . The defeated regime allegedly used brutal militias to attack supporters of the declared winner of the poll, Ouattara, but some of his backers are equally accused of atrocities in violence that killed thousands. The Gbagbo couple were arrested in April 2011. The former first lady was taken into custody in the north of the west African country, where she testified she was 'beaten with incredible violence'. The former president himself is in The Hague awaiting trial in July for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Affi N'Guessan, the former head of the first couple's political party, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for his role in the unrest, covered by the two years he has already served in detention. No one close to Ouattara has been investigated or prosecuted in connection with the violence.

        "article": "The Liberal Democrats were accused last night of using public money to garner votes after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of places to benefit from a new fuel subsidy will be in their own seats. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme \u2013 funded by the British taxpayer \u2013 was signed off by the European Commission. But 14 are in Lib Dem seats, including two in Mr Alexander\u2019s own constituency in the Scottish Highlands. Labour suggested there should be an inquiry into so-called \u2018pork barrel politics\u2019 by the Lib Dems, who also boast of channelling cash for roads and schools to their own seats. Mr Alexander, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims that he is shoring up votes in his seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere. In the past, cash has been found for a tax break for ski lifts, a bailout for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the Cairngorms. In January, Nick Clegg announced plans for a \u00a3300million \u2018city deal\u2019 for Inverness, including \u00a32million to promote Loch Ness and its mythical monster to tourists. Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie suggested the deals should be investigated by the Commons public accounts committee to see if they represent value for money. At the pumps: Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme \u2013 funded by the British taxpayer \u2013 was signed off by the European Commission . Mr Leslie said: \u2018While I\u2019m sure there are many living in rural areas who would love a fuel duty cut, it seems more than a coincidence that this is largely restricted to Danny Alexander\u2019s backyard and those of his small band of Lib Dem colleagues. \u2018Taken together with the very convenient tax break for his local ski lift, there\u2019s something very fishy about these decisions, and perhaps the public accounts committee ought to investigate.\u2019 Nick Clegg has promised to create a Cornish Assembly in a bid to shore up his party\u2019s vote in the county. The Deputy Prime Minister (right) made the pledge as he yesterday embarked on a tour of the key Lib Dem battleground. The party is desperately trying to avoid a wipeout in the county where it once held all six seats.\u00a0Currently, three of the area\u2019s MPs are Lib Dems. Mr Clegg said that he would create a Cornish Assembly, similar to that in Wales, which could allow the Cornish to choose different rules to the rest of England in areas potentially relating to second home ownership and bus services. But the plans dismissed as \u2018ill-considered\u2019 and a \u2018nonsense\u2019 by Cornish nationalists. Mr Clegg said: \u2018When the Cornish Assembly is born, it would be up to those who are elected to shape Cornwall\u2019s destiny. 'We could change planning law and council tax so buying up second homes in Cornwall comes with a greater price.\u2019 Nine areas benefiting from the new \u2018rural fuel rebate\u2019 are in the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency of former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy who is facing a desperate fight with the SNP to hang on to his seat. Two are in Mr Alexander\u2019s seat, and another two are in the constituency of his Lib Dem neighbour John Thurso. Another beneficiary is Lynton, North Devon, in the constituency of former Lib Dem defence minister Sir Nick Harvey, and one of only four seats in England to benefit. Others are in Cumbria, Northumberland and North Yorkshire. Mr Alexander said the move will help up to 125,000 people in areas faced with some of the highest fuel prices in the country. It is the first time the European Union has approved a fuel discount for people living on the UK mainland. Currently, islanders off the coast of Scotland and in the Isles of Scilly are eligible for a 5p discount on petrol and diesel because the cost of transporting fuel there means pump prices are much higher. The scheme will be extended to 17 mainland areas at the end of May. A source close to Mr Alexander denied the scheme was designed to favour Lib Dem seats. He said the selection process had been \u2018evidence-based\u2019. \u2018This is testament to how hard Danny has fought and campaigned on this issue over many years,\u2019 he said. \u2018Danny represents a rural community with many remote areas and so he knows first-hand the extra financial burden this puts on families and businesses facing high fuel costs while relying on cars to travel long distances.\u2019",

Spotted in the western Andean cloud forest, the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape-shifting capability. Researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators \u2013 but say this has yet to be proven. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a frog in Ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on.Spotted in the western Andean cloud forest, the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape-shifting capability . The new species, called Pristimantis mutabilis was discovered by a Case Western Reserve University PhD student and her husband at Reserva Las Gralarias. Katherine Krynak spotted the spiny frog, which nearly the width of a marble, sitting on a moss-covered leaf. The Krynaks captured the frog, and nicknamed it 'punk rocker' because of the thorn-like spines covering its body. The next day, Ms Krynak pulled the frog from the cup and set it on a smooth white sheet of plastic. It wasn't 'punk ' - it was smooth-skinned. The new species, called Pristimantis mutabilis - or mutable rainfrog - was discovered by a Case Western Reserve University PhD student and her husband at Reserva Las Gralarias. This image shows how the frog changes from spiky to almost smooth in just over 300 seconds . They assumed that, much to her dismay, she must have picked up the wrong frog. 'I then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss,' she said. 'The spines came back... we simply couldn't believe our eyes, our frog changed skin texture. 'I put the frog back on the smooth white background. Its skin became smooth.' 'The spines and colouration help them blend into mossy habitats, making it hard for us to see them,' she said. 'But whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested.' In this image, one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside . This is the astonishing 'glass' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible. The Fleischmann's Glass Frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves, as the background shows through its transparent flesh. The bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels. Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia. In this image, one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside. During the next three years, a team of fellow biologists studied the frogs. They found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes. A separate research them at Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Indoam\u00e9rica, Ecuador, discovered that Primates sobetes, a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of P. mutabilis, has the same trait. Because the appearance of animals has long been one of the keys to identifying them as a certain species, the researchers believe could mean many species have been missed.",

        "article": "A high-flying academic who travels the world as a Government adviser is set to be deported from Britain under 'barmy' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year. Dr Miwa Hirono, 38, is originally from Japan but has been living in the UK since becoming a lecturer at the University of Nottingham seven years ago. The world-renowned academic's work - which helps the UK Government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in China and Africa. Set to be deported: Miwa Hirono with her husband, Peter Trebilco, 61, and one-year-old son Tada, must leave Britain\u00a0under 'barmy' new visa laws . In 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. But Home Office immigration laws now state that people working in the UK on a migrant visa cannot be out of the country for more than 180 days each year. And despite the fact Dr Hirono does research for a Government-funded organisation and her baby son was born in Britain, the Home Office has decided to deport her. Her university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' but the Home Office has refused to back down. Today, Dr Hirono, who lives in Beeston, Notts., with her husband Peter Trebilco, 61, and their one-year-old son Tada, said: 'It came as a massive, utter shock. 'My Australian husband quit his job to join me in the UK as a family. I bought a house in Beeston two years ago and gave birth to my son here. 'I have my life here, everything is here but I have to give up everything. Battle: Dr Hirono's university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' 'It is idiocy. The Government funded my research and now they are penalising me for hard work and contributing to their policies. 'I have one published paper which is uploaded on the UK embassy in Beijing's website. They changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010. 'What has happened to me is absolutely wrong and everyone understands my point except the Home Office. 'I thought this was a democratic country with natural justice but it doesn't seem that way.' Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical'. Instead she has taken a job at a university in Kyoto, Japan, and the family are leaving the UK on March 29. Her husband Peter said the Home Office decision has caused the family to uproot their whole life. Left with no choice: Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical' He added: 'It tears at your heart because we've gone to great lengths to make good friends in the neighbourhood and we're very supportive and contribute to the community. 'We're having to tear our son out of nursery, give up a home we've established, with neighbours we're very fond of, and none of that is our doing. 'It's an inflexibility - the law does not have the capacity to deal with individual situations. It's our whole life.' Dr Hirono came to the University of Nottingham in 2008 on a prestigious five-year Research Council UK fellowship, which then became a permanent role. But when applying to extend her visa last March, she was banned and told she would be deported because of the foreign travel aspect of her job. University bosses even wrote to the Home Office to tell officials that the trips were part of her job. In December, Dr Hirono won an appeal against the Home Office with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had 'made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country'. But that ruling was later overturned and immigration bosses confiscated the family's passports a year ago. Professor Mathew Humphrey said Dr Hirono's research had had a significant impact on policy towards China, including on the UK's co-operation programme with the country. Unsympathetic: Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight' Philip Cowley, professor of parliamentary government at the university, said: 'It is pure madness for the government to be driving out an expert on what is probably the most important foreign policy challenge of the next decade. 'Both from a human perspective and from the interests of the UK, this is indefensible.' Dr Hirono's local MP, Anna Soubry, even wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May asking her to consider the decision, but no action was taken. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Ms Hirono's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in July 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the UK.' Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight'. Dr Hirono said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the UK's ability to hire foreign professionals. She added: 'This could mean the UK loses its capacity to hire any foreign professional on a permanent basis. 'Who would want to stop their live elsewhere and move everything to the UK only to be kicked out after five years.'",

        "article": "The expenses cheat congressman who decorated his office in the style of Downton Abbey has compared himself to Abraham Lincoln as he finally quit office. Aaron Schock predicted in his farewell address on Thursday that like another Republican representative from Illinois who once held his seat, he would ultimately persevere. Schock said he would leave Capitol Hill with 'sadness and humility', but he knows that 'God has a plan for' everyone. He offered no apology to other members of Congress, his constituents or taxpayers for a litany of lavish claims. Schock's downfall came after a Washington Post reporter discovered that he had redecorated his office in the style of acclaimed British television show Downton Abbey to the tune of $40,000, paid for by the taxpayer. Details of more lavish spending, including taking a private jet to Chicago for an NFL match - then billing it as 'software' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . SHAMED: Congressman Aaron Schock was revealed to be a lavish spender and offered a valedictory speech today which contained no apology but compared him to Lincoln . 'GOOD LUCK TONIGHT': Schock tweeted this Instagram selfie with singer Ariana Grande, 21, before the American \u00a0Music Awards in November . IPHONE AT THE READY FOR HIS HOLINESS: Schock posted online a photo of him greeting Pope Francis in January on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp . Another trip saw him take a group of 20, including several interns to New York for a Katy Perry concert at a cost of $10,000. It was one of a series of celebrity events he attended and which were posted on his Instagram, featuring Arianna Grande and even Pope Francis. It was billed by Schock as a 'very legitimate trip' as it coincided with a visit to the city by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He then posted a picture of himself with the Indian leader. The final blow was when Politico discovered that Schock had wrongly reported and been reimbursed for mileage on his personal vehicle - bought at taxpayers' expense. But he acknowledged nothing of that in his speech, instead using it to say he was going through 'defeats' like Lincoln - the president nicknamed 'Honest Abe' throughout his political career for his utter personal integrity. 'I also know that every person faces adversity in life. Abraham Lincoln held this seat in Congress in one term. But few faced as many defeats in his personal, business and public life as he did,' Schock said. FIRE YOURSELF: Schock bragged on Instagram in November after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Trump Tower office . 'THE PRESIDENTIAL': Schock's congressional office budget covered more than $5,000 for this custom podium, styled after the one President Obama uses when he's on the road . 'His continual perseverance in the face of these trials, never giving up, is something all of us Americans should be inspired by, especially when going through a valley in life.' A rising star in the Republican Party, and one of the youngest members of Congress from either political party, the flashy congressman, first attempted to weather the storm - hiring top-level communications strategists to help him beat back the charges - before announcing he would quit hours after his mileage claims came to light. In exiting Congress swiftly Schock avoided an ethics investigation from his peers. He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Technically a Member of Congress until the end of the month, Schock said goodbye to his constituents and colleagues today as representatives prepared to head home for a two and a half week long recess built around the Easter holiday. The nearest he came to an apology was to speak of 'humility'. 'I was never more excited than the day I walked into this chamber six years ago. I leave here with sadness and humility,' Schock said on the House floor. 'For those whom I've let down, I will work tirelessly to make it up to you.' He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Lincoln was first nicknamed Honest Abe when he was a store clerk in Springfield, Illinois, and the epithet stuck with him throughout his life. He used it as the 1859 presidential campaign slogan. RED IS THE COLOR:The lavish design appointments earned Schock snickers . REP. HARDBODY: Schock made a splash in May 2011 with this Men's Health magazine cover . Schock was correct that they had represented the same seat but Lincoln's sole term was not because he had to resign or because the voters kicked him out - he in fact was standing by his pledge that he would serve only one term. A Whig at the time he served in the federal legislature, Lincoln went on to become the 16th President of the United States, a position he held while the country was immersed in its first, and only, civil war. His Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in Confederate, southern states fighting against the Union. Sounding more optimistic than humiliated, Schock said today that he believes 'through life's struggles, we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves.' 'And I know that this is not the end of a story, but rather the beginning of a new chapter,' he added. 'Thank you for the honor to serve,' he said in at the conclusion of his remarks, nothing that he looks forward to keeping in touch with both his friends in Congress and in his district. He then left the House chamber - and an empty coffee cup, violating the legislature's rules - to applause. According to the Hill, three of his Republican colleagues - Jason Smith of Missouri, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina - were waiting in the wings for him as he gave his speech. Sanford memorably rose from the ashes to take back his old congressional seat after leaving his state's governor's office in disgrace several years before. Following his first stint in Congress Sanford was elected and reelected as governor of South Carolina before he was caught cheating on his wife with an Argentinian mistress whom he later proposed to but never married. Still beloved in South Carolina by some of his former constituents Sanford reclaimed his House seat via a special election in 2013 and achieved reelection last fall. He ironically shares the same birthday with Schock. After Shock announced his resignation, his father said: 'Two years from now he\u2019ll be successful, if he\u2019s not in jail.'",

        "article": "(CNN)\"The Stomp\" remains one of the most controversial plays in NCAA history -- when Duke's Christian Laettner lifted his foot and stepped on Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, the 1992 NCAA East Regional Final. Mention The Stomp in a diner or bar in Kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue-haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how Laettner is the vilest human on Earth. Then, the woulda, coulda, shouldas begin: Laettner should've been kicked out; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot; Kentucky should've advanced to the Final Four. The Stomp returned to headlines this week after ESPN aired a \"30 for 30\" documentary called \"I Hate Christian Laettner,\" detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day. When it comes to The Stomp, Laettner says he decided to give a \"little payback\" while Timberlake lay helpless on the ground. If Kentucky fans needed more reason to hate Laettner, those words might've been it. But on Twitter, Laettner issued a video apology to Timberlake, the first time he'd ever done so: . Timberlake could've lashed back, but he's too classy for that. He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He remains active in basketball, coaching an eighth-grade girls travel-team in Atlanta. (In full transparency, I coached with him last year.) He responded to Laettner, saying he appreciates and accepts the apology. But he makes it clear where his loyalty lies. At the end of his 23-second message, Timberlake's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with: \"Go Big Blue.\" Timberlake doesn't dwell on The Stomp. The thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by Coach Rick Pitino after the game. Pitino held up an old Sports Illustrated cover that said the Kentucky program was in shambles. Pitino told his players that although they lost on the court, his players had done something much bigger: They'd put Kentucky basketball back on the map. \"It put a lot of things in perspective, especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy NCAA sanctions,\" Timberlake says. \"All I remember is working with our heads down, attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability. And that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work, even in a loss.\" That is a message, he says, that still resonates in his life: \"Sometimes you don't see the full picture and don't reap the immediate rewards of your work, but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen.\" Timberlake has had fun with The Stomp over the years, even donning a \"I Still Hate Laettner\" T-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when Kentucky and Duke played a couple years ago. He jokes that he's not sure if he was \"a true hater\" of Laettner like so many others. But that game will never quite sit well with Kentucky players and fans. However, Timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on Laettner that he thought he'd never have. \"I can really respect his accomplishments, his basketball career and his passion for the game,\" Timberlake says. Don't get him wrong. Timberlake still bleeds Kentucky blue. He'd love to see Kentucky play Duke for the title this year, this time with the Wildcats walking away as the winners.

A New Hampshire ex-official believed to be the first transgender person elected to a state legislature was charged on Thursday with calling in a bomb threat to a hospital, police said. Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center. Police evacuated the building but found no suspicious device. An investigation led police to issue a warrant for Laughton's arrest; the Nashua resident complied. Calls weren't being accepted Thursday at a phone listed for Laughton. In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve. The state's Ballot Law Commission denied Laughton's request to run again last year, saying Laughton's 2008 convictions for identity fraud and falsifying evidence disqualified the would-be candidate until 2018, when a suspended sentence ends. Laughton was charged on Thursday with making a false report regarding explosives, a felony that can bring up to 7 years in prison if convicted. Laughton was released on $50,000 bond and is due back in court in April. Laughton expressed remorse for alleged actions and blamed them on an untreated mental illness. 'I have had a mental illness my whole life, and I guess this was my worst break with it. I was untreated for a long time, and I didn't have medication,' Laughton told the New Hampshire Union Leader following her arrest. 'I wasn't trying to hurt anyone, and it was totally out of character for me. I have put a lot behind me, and I never thought I would do this in a million years,' she told the newspaper. Stacie Laughton was born Barry C. Laughton Jr. and was convicted twice in Nashua before she ever turned 20. Bomb threat: Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center (pictured) Police told The Patch that in 2002 she was charged with domestic violence/criminal mischief after an argument with her father during which she smashed a plate. In 2003 she was charged with sexual assault involving a woman from whom she was renting a rorom. 'Those charges were eventually dropped,' Laughton told The Patch in 2012 following her resignation from her elected position. Convicted felon:\u00a0In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve . 'In fact, she still lives in the city, and we see each other from time to time, and we are pleasant. It's as if those years never happened,' she said. Laughton said three years ago that she hopes to run for office again someday despite her sordid past. Her criminal history will prevent her from doing so. 'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me. I began my transformation, from who I had been for all those years, to who I really was,' Laughton said. 'And ever since that that day, I do something, every day to try to better myself, or help someone else. I am trying to be the best person I can be, and put the past behind me, once and for all. ' wanted change: \u00a0'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me. I began my transformation, from who I had been for all those years, to who I really was,' Laughton said in 2012 as she resigned from office .",

The airline confirmed the Boeing 777 with the flight number TK15 was carrying 256 people and made a diversion due to a 'bomb threat'. A Turkish Airlines flight has been forced into an emergency landing following a bomb scare . The action on board was reported by Istanbul-based journalist\u00a0Erdem Arda G\u00fcne\u015f . Istanbul-based journalist Erdem Arda G\u00fcne\u015f claimed on Twitter that the diversion was due to a bomb scare after a note was discovered in the plane's toilet. The airline has not yet confirmed the bomb threat was made using a note in the toilet. However, Turkish Airlines said it is standard procedure to make an emergency landing if a threat is issued.

Instead, the 31-year-old Irish actor was deluged with queries that ranged from the bizarre to the thoroughly indecent. Marriage proposals also proved popular with Poldark fans taking part in the Twitter Q&A, which took place immediately after the fourth episode of the drama aired, as did requests for an uptick in shirtless scenes. Scroll down for video . Inundated: The 31-year-old was deluged with bizarre questions and marriage proposals from fans . 'AskPoldark will u marry me? I think you're bloody gorgeous Aiden xxx' asked a fan named Julie during the Q&A. 'How do you ever stop looking in the mirror?' asked a Twitter user called SammyPie. Others just seemed overwhelmed. 'Like most women (and quite a few men) I cant think of anything sensible to #AskPoldark once Aidan takes his shirt off. Sorry,' wrote one hyperventilating fan. Another, named Sarah Hook, asked: '#AskPoldark why was I never offered the position of painting semi nude actors when I had my careers talk at school?!' Turner, although slow to respond to marriage proposals, gamely attempted to answer many of the more sensible questions offered up by fans, including one about his new-found fame. Swooning: A fan named Jane Williams spoke for many when she shared her appreciation of shirtless scenes . Compliments: Many of the questions offered up by fans focused on Aidan Turner's looks . Nice work! Another wished that her careers' advice had included tips on becoming a make-up artist . Asked whether he knew that a Twitter account dedicated to his hair existed, the Irishman answered: 'I am aware, yeah! It\u2019s pretty hilarious!' Not everyone was happy with his answers, however, with one fan complaining that Turner took longer to answer than his character did to find copper - a reference to the ongoing plot line about Poldark's mining activities. 'Did he answer any of the questions or has he been removed to some sort of high security location for his own protection? #AskPoldark', wrote another fan named Katy Moran afterwards. Most, however, contented themselves with firing questions on everything from gardening to the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre at the actor. Gardening: Another popular topic with fans was gardening - in particular the scything of lawns . Left field: Others offered up some more unusual questions about the election and Norwich city centre . Too slow: Others complained about the actor's slowness to answer questions . Among the more amusing was a question from a Twitter user named Linda who asked the actor whether he might be interested in a spot of gardening. 'My mower has packed up,' she wrote. 'Would you come round and scythe my lawn please? #AskPoldark' Another, David Hussey, offered up a tongue-in-cheek query that read: 'AskPoldark thinking of ditching the wife, running off with a red-haired wench and opening a copper mine. Any tips or pilchard recipes?' Most entertaining of all was a fan who quizzed Turner on his plans for life post-Poldark. 'Would you consider presenting Top Gear?' asked Adele Mitchell. Turner chose not to answer that one. Pin up: Another asked how Turner's new-found pin-up status was working out for him . Clarkson's replacement? One hopeful fan asked Turner to consider a presenting career . Popular: The Cornish drama has proved one of the BBC's most successful dramas of 2015 so far .",

And Austin, who has scored the most goals of any English player in the Premier League this season, is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder. The 25-year-old came up through the ranks in lower league football, before getting his break in the big time. To fund himself while playing for clubs like Kintbury Rangers and Hungerford Town, Austin was a builder by trade, but now the time has come for a change in mentality. Charlie Austin (right) thinks he has scored enough goals to be considered a footballer rather than a builder . Austin has come up through the ranks, starting in non-League and working his way to the top . 'I have scored 100-odd career goals now,' Austin told The Sun, 'and think I have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football. I know where I have come from but I feel like I have done enough to be known as a footballer now. 'The only blisters I have on my hands these days are from the gym. Laying bricks was about five or six years ago now.' His journey to this point is the antithesis of Kane's, who has spent 11 years in the relative comfort of Tottenham Hotspur's academy. The now-QPR striker got his first League break at Swindon Town, for whom he scored over 30 goals . Austin takes on team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips during a training session at Queens Park Rangers . For Austin though, that route didn't work out. He was released by Reading as a teenager for being too small, and had to rely on opportunities elsewhere to get where he is today. 'Coming through the academies didn't work for me,' the QPR striker continues. 'I was released at 14. I wouldn't change it at all. Harry [Kane] would probably tell you the same about his upbringing. We just got taught differently. 'My way you pick up things as you go through the game. For players in academies... everything is in place for them at the clubs.' Regardless of their differences, Austin and Kane will face each other for the first time on Saturday afternoon. In fact, they've never even met before. 29 league goals between them this season has warranted calls for international call-ups, but all eyes will be on west London to see which player comes out on top in this encounter. Austin's career in football has been the opposite of Harry Kane, who has been at Tottenham for 11 years . The 25-year-old will come face-to-face with Kane for the first time in his career on Saturday afternoon .",

The Lib Dem leader was introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in\u00a0circles. Mr Clegg was told the animals have a lifespan of just five years, which he might be able to relate to as his party face the prospect of being booted out of government for the first time since 2010. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg and Lib Dem candidate Lorely Burt were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles . Mr Clegg donned his wellies for a yomp around Parkridge Centre, part of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust in Solihull. The election campaign officially got underway when David Cameron to tell the Queen that Parliament has been dissolved. Mr Clegg then made his own trip to the Palace for a separate private audience - as Lord President of the Privy Council he has an obligation to do so. He then headed to the Midlands for what was billed as a campaign visit on the NHS, in a seat the Lib Dems are fighting to hold. But he donned his wellies for a yomp around Parkridge Centre, part of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust in Solihull. Humpty the hedgehog got his name after falling off a wall and suffering head injuries.\u00a0Mr Clegg, who last week revealed his dream to make wildlife documentaries, spoke to children about a new scheme to protect hedgehogs. They were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles. Mr Clegg insisted that his 'plucky party' can defy the polls and declared the era of single-party politics is over . Later he insisted that his 'plucky party' can defy the polls and declared the era of single-party politics is over. The Lib Dem leader said that in the '50 or 60' seats where his party had an MP or an effective presence on the ground they were doing far better than opinion polls suggested. On a visit to Solihull, a knife-edge marginal with a Lib Dem majority of just 175, he said people would hear his party's side of the story during the campaign. On a visit to the Brueton Park nature reserve in the constituency, the first stop of the campaign tour, Mr Clegg insisted his 'plucky party'\u00a0could defy the polls. He said: 'What you have got to ask is how are we doing in those 50, 60 seats where we have MPs, we have campaigners, we have councillors. 'There, the picture is completely different to the national snapshot polls because there people hear the LIberal Democrat side of the story - which is one we are very proud of - which is about a plucky party stepping up to the plate back in May 2010 when the country desperately needed it.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg left Downing Street shortly after Mr Cameron before his own meeting with the Queen . The mud-soaked visit to the Midlands was a long way from his final visit to Buckingham Palace. Speaking before visiting the Queen this morning, Mr Clegg told reporters: 'It is my view that the era of single-party government is now over in British politics.' He said the Tory/Lib Dem coalition formed in 2010 was a 'historic government' which was formed at a time of 'national economic emergency'\u00a0and had got the economy growing again. 'About the very last thing the country now needs is a lurch to the left or the right and yet that is exactly what the Conservative and Labour parties are now threatening,' said the Liberal Democrat leader.",

Nothing seemed less likely than this when Trott left England's Ashes tour 16 months ago after his public ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson. The road back since he returned home after the first Test in Brisbane with a 'stress-related condition' later diagnosed as situational anxiety has been a long and tortuous one. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott has been recalled to the England Test squad for their upcoming tour . Trott has completed his recovery from a stress-related condition that stretches back to the Ashes in 2013 . Trott will compete with Adam Lyth for an opening batting slot alongside Alastair Cook . Yet against all the odds and after the key development of working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters, Trott is back and will compete with Adam Lyth to become Alastair Cook's opening partner in the three-Test series. There will be those who worry about Trott's fragility but mental injuries should be treated no differently from physical ones and now he has been given a clean bill of health it is right that the 33-year-old should be picked. Lyth gets the nod ahead of Sam Robson and his emerging county colleague Alex Lees, and becomes one of an incredible six Yorkshiremen in the squad after scoring 1,489 championship runs at 67.68 last season. Adil Rashid, another Yorkshireman, and Durham fast bowler Mark Wood are the other newcomers. Rashid made the last of his 10 limited-overs appearances for England six years ago but is a more mature leg-spinning all-rounder and person now at 27. Stokes, who missed out on the World Cup after a miserable year of form, returns in place of the injured Chris Woakes, but England see him more as a No 6 batsman and fourth seamer in Test cricket. England hope Moeen Ali will overcome a side injury to join the tour in time for the second Test in Grenada. In his absence Rashid will compete for the No 1 slow-bowling spot with Kent's reliable off-spinner James Tredwell, who edged out Surrey's Zafar Ansari for the final place in the squad.

Magistrate Wendy Cull handed down the two-year prison sentence which is to be suspended after three months saying that the fraudulent behaviour was planned and systematic. 36-year-old Karma Elms has been sentenced to 2 years jail after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime . The offence saw 36-year-old, Karma Elms scam the Health department out of $39,352 over 15 months. According to the Magistrate, Elms showed a 'degree of defensiveness' despite pleading guilty and made note of the fact that she had travel a long way to get to work. She has not yet repaid the debt and is on the brink of bankruptcy after spending all of the stolen funds on credit cards, rent and gift hampers. 'Clearly you are a poor manager of your personal finances and have spent money that far exceeded your income,' The ABC reported Magistrate Cull said. Elms was hired by Queensland health in 2010 to help with the large workload after the department's flawed payroll system was introduced that left 1800 employees with little or no pay. The Caboolture woman pleaded guilty to the charges and is still to repay the $39,352 as she has spent it all . The court was told that the Caboolture woman may have been suffering from anxiety from work demands . The court was told that the Caboolture woman may have been suffering from anxiety from the extra work demands. Magistrate Cull told the court that Elms had a disadvantaged childhood with an abusive stepfather who she escaped at the end of high school and now supports her mother. Despite her background and a glowing reference from her new employer, the Magistrate said she had swindled money that she had no right to. Elms' lawyer, Mark Williams said she is apologetic about her actions and has rejected the idea that she wished to refute the charges. The Crime and Corruption Commission hope to use Elms as an example to other public servants. 'It is totally unacceptable that public money was diverted from other essential health services which should benefit all Queenslanders,' acting director Paxton Booth said. 'If public sector employees defraud the Government, they can expect to be caught and prosecuted.'",

        "article": "San Francisco 49ers player Chris Borland, a leading rookie last season, is retiring from the NFL at age 24 over health concerns related to repeated head trauma, ESPN and the team said on Monday. ESPN reported he was retiring over health concerns related to head trauma, an issue that has rattled the league and prompted a massive lawsuit against the NFL. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told ESPN's Outside the Lines. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.' He continued:\u00a0'I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.' Scroll down for video . San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . Borland, who played college football at University of Wisconsin, played just one year in the NFL with the 49ers . The 49ers did not specify in its statement why Borland chose to leave after just one season. 'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision.' Borland, a linebacker, was a star in his only season with the team, registering 108 tackles, a quarterback sack and two interceptions, and earned several rookie of the week and rookie of the month honors. An ankle injury in December ended his season. He has had two prior concussions and said he notified the 49ers of his decision on Friday, which the team confirmed. Borland, who had two concussions prior to retirement, made his announcement on Friday. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' he told ESPN's Outside the Lines program . The third-round NFL Draft choice said he was being 'proactive' despite feeling 'as sharp as I've ever been.' 'I'm concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it's too late,' Borland said. 'There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen.' He becomes the most prominent NFL player to turn his back on a rich contract, a four-year deal worth just under $3million in Borland's case, over concerns about brain injuries. The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing . His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football . NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it means for football as a whole . San Jose Mercury News's Tim Kawakami and\u00a0NFL.com's Michael Silver highlighted what Borland's retirement meant for the larger sport of football. 'I used to think that 99% of players wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from this-- the game, the fame, the lifestyle. But...' Kawakami wrote. 'But the perspective is changing. Chris Borland just put himself at the forefront of that, and he obviously did it with a lot of thought.' 'I understand the compulsion of 49ers fans to see this through team-centric eyes, but Borland's decision is bigger than that, obviously,' Silver wrote. Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt mentioned that this announcement might allow other players to be more open about concussions. Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt said that Borland's retirement could allow for other players to have more open discussions about concussions . Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision . 'Borland news may not lead to more players retiring early but may lead to less players inclined to hide and play through the head trauma,' Brandt wrote. Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision. 'Looking at the number of early retirees in the NFL this month, You'd better believe the Junior Seau story has a lot of people thinking,' Farrar wrote. A class-action lawsuit involving thousands of former players, filed in 2012, contended that the league hid the dangers of brain injury among players while profiting from the sport's violent physical contact. There have been suicides in recent years by former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson. In February, a U.S. judge refused to accept a proposed settlement between the NFL and the players, saying payment should be expanded for some players and families among other concerns.",

        "article": "(CNN)Police officer and former U.S. Army Ranger John Moynihan was honored at the White House less than a year ago as one of the nation's \"Top Cops\" for helping to save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the Boston Marathon bombers. On Saturday, Moynihan, 34, was in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital after being shot in the face at point-blank range in the city's Roxbury neighborhood the night before. The gunman was shot and killed. \"He's a strong kid,\" Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. \"He's a fighter. He's going to pull through.\" On Sunday, after several hours of surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, Moynihan, who had been listed in critical condition, was in stable and improving condition, according to a Twitter posting by the Boston Police Department. A six-year police veteran and member of the youth violence task force, Moynihan was shot below the right eye. The bullet lodged behind his right ear, Evans said. In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. Police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. One round nearly killed Donohue. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their \"heroic and relentless\" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. An officer pressed against Donuhue's chest. Another forced air into his lungs. The wound near his groin was too high for a tourniquet. A 33-year police veteran, Donohue was pale and appeared dead as four officers laid him on a gurney. \"He was essentially dead,\" said Dr. Heather Studley, who took over his care at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed that night; his younger brother is on trial now in a federal death penalty case in Boston. At a White House ceremony last May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as \"America's Top Cops.\" \"There are officers here who were in the thick of two attacks last year:  the shooting at the Washington Naval Yard and the bombing at the Boston Marathon,\" Obama said at the time. \"On those awful days -- and we all remember them -- amid the smoke and the chaos, the courage of these officers shone through.  And their quick thinking and level-headedness undoubtedly saved lives.\" In a statement Saturday, Donohue wished Moynihan a full recovery, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. \"John played a part in saving my life, and that's something I will never forget,\" Donohue said. \"His record of service speaks for itself. Everyone is wishing him well and we know he has the strength to pull through.\" At 6:40 p.m. Friday, Moynihan and other officers pulled over a car in an area where gunshots had been reported earlier, Evans said. The primary job of the task force, also known as the gang unit, is to remove guns from the streets. Six officers in separate cars, sirens blaring, were involved in the traffic stop, which was captured by surveillance cameras in the area. Moynihan walked up to the driver's side door. A man started to step out. \"Without provocation, as the driver is getting out ... you can see his right arm come up point-blank and shot officer Moynihan right below the eye,\" Evans said. Evans described the officers approach as \"very low key\" and said they weren't \"even close to having their guns out.\" After shooting Moynihan, the suspect ran, turned around and fired at the other officers -- emptying his .357 Magnum, according to Evans. Evans said a middle-aged woman was who driving by at the time suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. The shooter, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot and killed. Evans said West had several prior gun convictions. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. \"None of our officers like to use their firearms,\" Evans said. \"It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face.\" At a news conference, Evans and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Moynihan is white; West was black. \"Our officers did what they had to do,\" the police commissioner said. The Rev. Mark Scott of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston said Moynihan was shot \"assassination-style.\" He called for calm in the predominantly black Roxbury section. \"This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,'\" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. \"It's about all-the-lives-in-the-community matter and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community.\" Evans said 1,071 guns were taken off the streets in Boston in 2014, with the youth violence task force and other units helping to seize more than 700. Moynihan is a decorated Army Ranger with stints in Iraq from 2005 to 2008, according to the police department. He won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014. His girlfriend and family have been at his bedside. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.",

Harper was a shock omission from Ricky Sbragia's Scotland Under 19 squad ahead of key clashes against Austria, Italy and Croatia with the former Sunderland manager citing 'purely tactical' reasons. Now, Harper's father John has warned Scotland that they could be in danger of losing his son to the Spanish national side. Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has been left out of the latest Scotland Under 19 squad . Scotland Under 19s manager Ricky\u00a0Sbragia claimed the reasons were 'purely tactical' Among Harper's coaches at Real Madrid are former France international\u00a0Zinedine Zidane (centre) He told the Daily Record: 'The day after Scotland announced the Under 19 squad, and Jack wasn\u2019t included, Spain were on the phone asking about his position and international status. 'Their national academy is just a few miles from Real Madrid\u2019s own training ground, so they know about Jack because they watch his team often enough.' Despite being left out of Sbragia's latest UEFA Under 19 Championship squad, Harper's father insists that the Madrid starlet remains committed to Scotland. John added: 'Jack wants to play for Scotland. I\u2019m Scottish, so is his mum and the rest of the family. He is committed to Scotland, but if nothing is happening by the time he is 21 then he will have a decision to make because he has a life and a career to fulfil. Hopefully, it won\u2019t come to that.' Harper's father was contacted by Spain shortly after his son's international snub . Sbragia also still believes Harper, who was born in Spain, has a big future ahead of him in a Scotland shirt. He said:\u00a0'He's an exceptionally gifted lad, but sometimes we can't carry him. He can be a luxury sometimes. In some cases, if it's going well, he can be a good luxury.' 'Listen, Jack's time will come. The last time I spoke to him, he wanted to really settle in at Real Madrid and find a place there. That's been a big thing for him. 'I've gone with the boys I've seen most in the last six months. We keep tabs on Jack and see video clips of him. We have people over there who keep their eye on him. 'There are others I've left out like Dominic Thomas at Motherwell who will have gripes that they're not in the squad. 'But I've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us. It's my opinion and I'm not saying it's right. But the squad I've picked is an extremely strong one. 'I can only pick 18 when I really could have picked 26 or 27. I've gone for a physical side and runners. Hopefully I'm right. 'It's purely tactical and there certainly hasn't been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.' Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future .",

On Clerkenwell Road, artists created a 3D art installation that looks as though the side of a building wall has been knocked through to reveal the interiors of a family home. The project, which took over two weeks to paint, is designed to inspire homeowners to be braver with colour. North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful thanks to this art installation . Artists have crafted a 3D art project that looks as though the side of a building has been knocked through . The illusory display is a type of artwork known as trompe d'oeil and exposes what looks like a two bedroom household above the revamped Hat & Feathers public house. Anything but a small artistic feat, the entire process took over 160 hours to cover the 1,352 square foot wall, and was created in honour of the UK and Ireland launch of Valspar paint. The thousands of passers-by who frequent the busy street corner each day had to do a double take. The lifelike interiors were brought to life by Poole-based community artist, Nina Camplin, who specialises in large-scale 'trick of the eye' paintings. The project is located on a busy corner on Clerkenwell Road, and attracts the attention of many passers-by . The illusory artwork, painted in trompe d'oeil style, depicts the interiors of a two bedroom family home . The project, which took over two weeks to paint, is designed to inspire homeowners to be braver with colour . In this instance, she used to her skills to create the 3D scene on an otherwise flat surface. The campaign is intended to encourage UK homeowners to inject a bit of colour into their own living spaces. Research shows that, currently, 78 per cent of UK homeowners opt to paint their homes in cream, white or neutral, while a mere 6 per cent of the nation embraces any sort of vivid hues in their interiors. Jane Ryder of Valspar Europe said: 'The reaction from the public so far has been amazing. 'So many people have stopped to take photographs and ask the artists about the project - it's starting to feel like London's latest tourist attraction!'

        "article": "(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"",

        "article": "'Unacceptable': Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson has spoken out about women not being rewarded equally in the workplace . Companies with more than 250 workers will be forced to publish details of their gender pay gap in a major Government U-turn. Liberal Democrat MPs are pushing to bring into effect measures in the 2010 Equality Act \u2013 which were not implemented by the Coalition \u2013 making companies publish the difference between male and female pay. Conservatives resisted the plans on the basis that companies should not be loaded with more red tape as the economy recovers from the financial crash. But government sources said that with Labour backing a change in the law, the Tories were confronted with the prospect of defeat in a crunch vote in the House of Lords. One said Conservative ministers had agreed the reform would be introduced, but only after a consultation with business leaders on exactly how it will work. Former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said he opposed the legislation because it would create \u2018more bureaucracy, more forms, more deterrent for companies to take on people\u2019. The new law will make it compulsory for larger companies to publish the average difference between the pay of their male and female employees. A voluntary approach to pay transparency encouraged by the Government has so far led to only five of the country\u2019s larger companies revealing their gender pay gaps. Labour says that analysis of the Office for National Statistics\u2019 annual survey of hours and earnings show that over a career, from the age of 22 to 64, a woman earns an average of \u00a3209,976 less than men. Gloria de Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities, said firms which had already decided to publish gender pay gap data had said \u2018the ceiling didn\u2019t cave in\u2019, adding: \u2018It just enabled them to see they had a problem and get to grips with it.\u2019 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: \u2018While the Liberal Democrats have made real progress in areas like shared parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working, the labour market is still stacked against women. Gloria de Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities . \u2018It simply cannot be acceptable that, in the 21st century, women on average still receive a smaller pay packet than men. \u2018We can\u2019t wait and we can\u2019t dither. We need to sort this out now. Finally, we are now in a position for the Government to vote through our party\u2019s manifesto commitment for large companies to publish the difference in average pay between male and female employees. \u2018These measures will shine a light on a company\u2019s policy so that women can rightly challenge their employer where they are not being properly valued and rewarded.\u2019 A Lib Dem source added: \u2018In discussions this week it was clear that the Tories wanted to delay taking any action on equal pay and kick the can down the road, just like they have for the last five years. \u2018It\u2019s a huge U-turn from the Tories but it\u2019s welcomed. At last we can take some real action.\u2019 The change in the law will be made in an amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill. Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson said: \u2018It is utterly unacceptable that women are not being equally rewarded in the workplace.\u2019 A Tory source said: \u2018We have made sure there must be proper consultation with business about how it works \u2013 not something either Labour or the Lib Dems were concerned with.\u2019 It will take 70 years before the gender pay gap closes worldwide, the United Nations has claimed. And it will be another 81 years before women have the same chance as men of becoming a chief executive, and 50 before women are just as likely to lead their country. According to the International Labour Organization, there is not a country in the world which has yet achieved gender equality. The UN agency found women who start families before they turned 25 suffered a particularly large \u2018wage penalty\u2019. Executive director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, said world leaders must ensure that \u2018promoting gender equality\u2019 was a \u2018top issue on their agenda, which it isn\u2019t now\u2019.",

        "article": "A company director who shaved her hair off before starting chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer has raised thousands of pounds for charity - by decorating her bald head for daily selfies. Internet sensation Sara Cutting has marked each day of her treatment by posing for a photo in a different hat, including designs made out of bread, cake, coffee cups, a radio, a lampshade and even a carrot. The 46-year-old then uploads the smiling selfies onto her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page for her friends, family and followers, while urging people to donate to MacMillan Cancer Support. Sara Cutting was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and decided to do a Different Daily Head Gear selfie challenge after shaving off all of her hair for chemotherapy . You would hope Sara didn't get neck ache from carrying this giant radio around on her head . Sara has been seriously inventive when it comes to picking out different head dresses, here she balanced a whole cake on her head . Sara discovered she had breast cancer last year after finding a lump whilst moisturising, before chemotherapy she decided to shave all of her hair off . And now on day 141, she has already raised more than \u00a38,000  for the charity, which she credits for supporting her through her treatment and recovery. Miss Cutting shaved off her shoulder-length blonde hair when she began chemotherapy in October. She has now finished the treatment and begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next Monday. She hopes to raise \u00a310,000 in total and the determined fundraiser, who owns a building and renovation company with her 39-year-old partner Liam Copsey, even took part in the Brighton Half Marathon last month. Miss Cutting, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'I shaved my hair off before it fell out because it felt like I would be taking control of the cancer, rather than the cancer controlling me. 'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me. It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling. 'I wanted to do something to raise awareness of breast cancer and to thank MacMillan Cancer Support, which has supported me through all of this.' When Sara first started her challenge she was pleased to realise that she had raised \u00a31000 in just two days . Sata has had to be very creative to come up with all of her ideas but she says that they have been helping her get through the process of chemotherapy . This brilliant straw head-dress makes Sara look a little bit like a scarecrow as the straw covers her bald head . During her journey Sara says that her friends have been kind enough to help her out not only with support, but with lending her some of her head gear . Miss Cutting was applying moisturiser to her body after a shower when she discovered a lump on her breast in July last year. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and within weeks she had surgery to remove the tumour and affected lymph nodes from her right breast. The operation was a success, but in October she began chemotherapy to ensure any stray cancer cells would be caught, too. Miss Cutting said: 'I went to the doctors about something unrelated to all this and just mentioned I'd been getting some dry skin under my arm pit. 'I was told to start using moisturiser after my shower to help prevent it, and one day when I was putting my body lotion on, I lifted my arm up and felt this lump on my breast. 'The following day I went to my GP, who referred me to the local breast care clinic. Within two weeks I was told I had a very aggressive form of cancer. It was such a shock - it still hasn't quite sunk in now.' This look, which features long strands of chain dangling down into Sara's face wouldn't be out of home in Lady Gaga's wardrobe . Sara says that the news that she had cancer still hasn't really sunk in but her friends and family have been a great support . Maybe Sara was hoping to catch some rain water with this hairband complete with a bucket attached to it . She continued: 'Soon after I had the operation to remove the tumour from my breast and remove the affected lymph nodes from there, too. 'The doctors think it went well as they can't see any more cancer there, but they still wanted to do the chemotherapy, just to be on the safe side..' It was then Miss Cutting decided to have her shoulder-length blonde hair shaved off and begin her one year Different Daily Headgear Challenge. She has since been inundated with donations from friends and strangers, and had several hats designed for her. The bubbly fundraiser is also accepting donations of headwear in her bid to reach her target of a daily selfie for 365 days. She hopes that her quirky challenge will help raise awareness and get more women and men to check their bodies for signs of breast cancer. One of Sara's most over-stated headdresses featured giant flowers on what looked like blue playes . Caroline clearly enjoys taking all of her pictures, always smiling happily at the camera as she tries to post a selfie every day for a year . Caroline says her partner has even been helping out and his kind-hearted young daughter offered to shave her head as well . Miss Cutting said: 'The treatment is hard and it absolutely knocks me for six, but it has to be done and I just take it day by day. 'There are always days when I'll feel I can't muster the energy to dress up, take a photo and post it on social media, but I have to and that has been good for me.' She added: 'Within two days of starting the campaign I'd raised 1,000 pounds. 'I have such amazing support from my friends, family and strangers, who have heard about what I'm doing. Liam's daughter Pippa is only 13 and she even offered to shave her hair off, too!' In one of Caroline's more elaborate outfits she decided not only to wear a giant head dress but to wear a matching bikini top as well . Caroline has used her project to encourage other people who may also suffer with breast cancer . Caroline wore this ballet themed head dress of pink fur covered in dancing shoes . And while the challenge was set up to help others, Sara says her daily selfies are also getting her through this difficult time. She added: 'Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me. 'It's a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I'm feeling, and if I can encourage one more man or woman to check their breasts, then it is all worth it.' Caroline always makes sure to make every single picture different, posing at different angles and in different locations . Some of Sara's more silly head-dresses have included a lampshade and this pink shower cap . A Christmas themed post showed Sara with glittering antlers attached to a cosy looking fur hood .",

The Barcelona full back was hounded by journalists while travelling home from a few days off over the international break. Alves has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp when his contract expires this summer, and he was repeatedly asked where he would be going. After being pressed about his future at Barcelona, Daniel Alves started singing at journalists . Alves is out of contract at Barcelona this summer, and has been linked with a move to PSG . Despite Alves wearing headphones and giving every indication that he had no interest in talking to the press, the questions kept coming. Eventually, when directly asked about a reported agreement with Paris St Germain, the Brazil defender lost patience, grabbing the microphone off one of the reporters and bursting into song, blasting out a few bars of Bazilian singer-songwriter Xande de Pilares . Fortunately Alves is a better footballer than a singer, and despite not featuring during this international break, and being allowed to leave Barcelona, is not without suitors amongst Europe's elite.",

        "article": "Two American tourists have been arrested for carving initials into the Colosseum in Rome. Before they were spotted, the women, 21 and 25, were able to carve a J and an N into a brick wall on the first floor of the west side of the\u00a0Colosseum. After carving the eight-inch high letters, the women posed together for a selfie. The women, just two of six million tourists that flock to the Colosseum every year, used a coin to engrave the letters, La Stampa\u00a0reported. They are said to have broken away from their tour group before - but other tourists saw what had happened and alerted security. Police charged the women with 'aggravated damage on building of historical and artistic interest', according to Republica. After they were caught, the women  apologized to\u00a0Piazza Dante police and\u00a0Captain Lorenzo Iacobone. They said: 'We apologize for what we did. We regret it but we did not imagine it was something so serious. 'We'll remember for a lifetime.' According to the Guardian, the section damaged dates back to the 1800s - a key period of restoration. A spokesman for the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome is quoted as saying: 'It\u2019s not an original wall but it\u2019s nevertheless antique.' With approximately six million visitors to the Colosseum each year and ever-increasing staff cuts, policing the site has become a major problem. Sadly many of the stones bear the unsightly engravings of tourists keen to leave their mark. The Californians\u2019 lawbreaking comes little over three months after a Russian tourist was caught carving a 25cm letter into the Colosseum. The 42-year-old was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a \u20ac20,000 fine, although owing to a lack of funds he has not paid the penalty. Two tourists from the United States were caught engraving their initials at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy . The women were charged with 'aggravated damage on a building of historical and artistic interest' on Saturday . He was said to be the fifth tourist seen defacing the Colosseum in 2014. A father and son from Australia and teenagers from Brazil and Canada were also caught out last year. Built in the first century CE, the Colosseum is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site. In order to make the \u00a0UNESCO list, a site must have a special cultural or physical significance. The Colosseum, which is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, was\u00a0named after a colossal statue that once stood nearby. The structure 'accommodated games of great popular appeal, such as hunts and gladiatorial fights' until the end of the Ancient Age, according to the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. The organization adds: 'The building was, and still is today, a show in itself. 'In fact, it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators.'",

While team-mates including Neymar Jnr, Dani Alves, and Adriano got suited and booted in their garish designer suits, the Argentina forward opted for a more conservative look. On the pitch Messi has the ability  to set the place alight but his ensemble on Sunday night left him looking distinctly average in comparison to his South American team-mates. Lionel Messi, Adriano, Bartra, Dani Alves, Neymar and Rafinha get suited and booted after the triumph . Goalscoring hero Luis Suarez poses for a pic with fellow frontmen Messi and Neymar after the victory . Barca's attacking trio pose for another dressing room snap after beating rivals Real Madrid . The 27-year-old plumped for a plain black jumper and the sort of grey trousers you might have worn as part of a school uniform. In fact, Messi wouldn't have looked out of place delivering a lesson to a group of geography students. That said, even the snappiest of dressers might be made to feel like a wallflower standing next to the flamboyant Neymar and Alves. The Brazilian duo caused quite a stir on social media with their choice of attire. Alves went for a silver jacket and gold shoes combo . While a night of celebrations might have been in order for some of the squad, Gerard Pique, who turned in a superb defensive performance at the Nou Camp, looked set for a quiet night in with the missus. After his impressive performance, Pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend Shakira . Suarez scored the winner for Barcelona in their 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp . Barcelona celebrated after moving four points clear of their rivals in La Liga with 10 games remaining . The Spain international was pictured leaving the stadium hand-in-hand with long-term pop star girlfriend Shakira. Pique earned rave reviews as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were kept relatively quiet during what could prove a season-defining victory.

Less than a week ago Bale found his white Bentley under attack from irate Real fans after the Clasico defeat to Barcelona in which influential newspaper Marca scored him zero mark. He has been subjected to boos from the stands and had his \u00a386million pricetag mocked and questioned.

Bale fires homes with a brilliant free-kick as Wales takes a 2-0 lead in the Euro 2016 group B qualifier . But in Wales\u2019 hugely important Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel Bale was magnificent, scoring twice to move onto 16 in total for his country and beyond the great John Charles in the all-time list. And Bale said: \u2018I don\u2019t need to answer the critics. I know, and everyone around me knows, what I can do. \u2018There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that. \u2018I don\u2019t feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football. Bale was heavily criticised after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Liga rivals Barcelona . Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following the defeat by Barcelona last Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The \u00a386million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . \u2018I love playing for Wales, it\u2019s a big honour and the most important thing is I focus on my football. I don\u2019t listen to anyone else, what they\u2019re saying, just enjoying my football with the boys.\u2019 He was a picture of happiness at full-time, emitting a roar of joy when the final whistle sounded in the Sammy Ofer Stadium to confirm a 3-0 win. A brace from Bale added to Aaron Ramsey\u2019s opener sent Wales top of Group B on 11 points at the halfway stage. Bale has been criticised by Madrid supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 . Bale celebrates as his team moved to the top of Group B with victory in Haifa over Israel . Bale uploaded this picture to Instagram afterwards with the caption 'what a performance from the lads' Bale should collect his 50th cap for his nation in June\u2019s qualifier against Belgium, where victory would put Wales on the precipice of reaching a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup. Bale has now scored 20 goals for club and country this season, including a brilliant free-kick in Israel, similar to his late winner in Andorra at the start of qualifying. His Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has not score direct from a set piece in more than 50 attempts dating back to last April. Bale sits joint-sixth, alongside Mark Hughes, Robert Earnshaw and Cliff Jones in the all-time Welsh scoring charts. Ian Rush leads the way with 28.",

The almost two-hour documentary on air pollution in China produced by a famous TV journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release Saturday, clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across Chinese cyberspace. The air pollution that's choking Asia . Here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context: . The slickly produced video shows journalist Chai Jing presenting a comprehensive slide show, intercutting with fast-paced footage of her travels across China and the rest of world, to find answers to three questions: What is smog, where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it? As shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of China regularly, the video has struck such a chord with the audience that, in two short days, it's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world's most populous nation. Many Internet users have compared it to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Chai, 39, was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at China Central Television, the state-run national broadcaster. As a long-time CCTV anchor and investigative reporter, Chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines. Her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her \"the Goddess\" for her elegance and intelligence on air. Plenty of detractors, however, consider her a leading elitist voice for the country's liberal intellectuals. After writing a best-selling autobiography chronicling her time at CCTV, Chai quit her job last year to take care of her daughter, who had been born with a tumor. Declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother, Chai tries to dig deep in her self-funded documentary. With her former CCTV connections opening doors, she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in China -- and received surprisingly candid responses. While there is no obvious hero in the video, the villain seems to be clear. A former chief engineer of the state-owned oil conglomerate Sinopec brushes off Chai's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible. Tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in China to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use, Chai sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters. Admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately. In countless reposts of the video links, people praise Chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses. One text message of gratitude to Chai from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government PR move. They point to the positive coverage of the video's massive online launch across state media, including an in-depth interview with Chai on the website of People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. Also, the timing: The video was released just days ahead of China's annual parliament session, during which legislators are expected to rubber-stamp the Communist leadership's policy agenda. President Xi Jinping had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority. Some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target, as Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector. Others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy. Questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including Chai's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter's tumor. And the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even China's seasoned censors off guard. Heated arguments have raged online, including blaming pollution on China's political system due to its lack of accountability. By late Sunday night, although the video remained online, all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites. With discussions on the video shifting to social media, a common consensus seems to have emerged: Love it or hate it, Chai's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the U.S. embassy as recently as November. Some internet users have compared \"Under the Dome\" phenomena to the discussion over \"the dress\"\u2014 you can fight over the color but what's important is that it's being talked about.",

        "article": "A 71-year-old Seattle missionary abducted last month from a school in Nigeria has been released and is safe, the Free Methodist Church USA said Friday. In a statement on the church website, Bishop David Kendall said the Reverend Phyllis Sortor was released Friday evening, Nigeria time, 'into the care of authorities and Free Methodist Church leaders'. Armed men abducted her on February 23 from the Hope Academy compound in Emiworo, Kogi state. Scroll down for video . Phyllis Sortor, 71, was abducted on February 23 from a Christian school in Nigeria. She was released on Friday and is safe . Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Sortor hostage . 'We are deeply grateful to all who prayed for Phyllis' safe return and praise God the family representative was able to secure her release,' Kendall said in his statement. He provided no details about how the release was arranged. 'As a matter of sound policy, and to help protect the many, many people who helped secure Phyllis' freedom, we will have no comment concerning the efforts that were undertaken to secure her release,' the bishop said. Kogi State police said shortly after the abduction that the men who took Sortor had demanded a ransom of nearly $300,000. Police said they were collaborating with security forces to secure her return. Friends described Sortor as courageous, tenacious and passionate about helping the people of Nigeria and said she was aware of the dangers. Sortor has been working as a missionary  for ten years. Her friends say she was passionate about helping people in Nigeria and aware of the dangers of working there . She had spent years living in Africa, including Mozambique - where she spent much of her childhood - later working in Rwanda and, since 2005, Nigeria, Kendall said . Her work in Kogi was focused primarily on educational development and conflict resolution between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities who frequently clash in central Nigeria's Middle Belt region, the church statement further said. Foreign nationals have often been kidnapped in Nigeria by local gangs who typically release hostages following a ransom payment. Such abductions are especially common in the southern, oil-producing Niger Delta, where expatriates working with large oil companies have been a frequent target. A number of foreigners have also been kidnapped in the north of the country, but those attacks claimed by Boko Haram or the associated Islamist group Ansaru are considered a different phenomenon, and not necessarily motivated by a desire for ransom. Boko Haram has been blamed for previous attacks in Kogi, including two raids targeting the same prison in 2012 and 2014. Nigeria's Islamists groups have in the past publicly claimed the abduction of expatriates and the lack of such a claim following Sortor's kidnapping led many to believe that Boko Haram and its affiliates were not involved.",

        "article": "The Labour party has upset its own MPs after selling mugs promising a control on immigration. The \u00a35 souvenirs were supposed to drum up cash for the party's election fighting fund. But they have sparked a storm of criticism, with prominent backbencher Diane Abbott branding them 'shameful'. Ed Miliband's promise to control immigration has been used as an unlikely slogan for a \u00a35 red mug on sale on the Labour website . Labour released five mugs to coincide with the Launch of Ed Miliband's five election pledges. Each red mug, sold through the party's website, has one of the pledges written in white. But the one promising 'controls on immigration' has uspet some of the party faithful. Ms Abbott wrote on Twitter: 'This shameful mug is an embarrassment. 'But real problem is that immigration controls are one of our 5 pledges at all.' At 5pm on Sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available, according to the Labour website. The other pledges are: 'A Strong Economic Foundation', 'Higher Living Standards For Working Families', 'An NHS With The Time To Care,' and 'A Country Where The Next Generation Can Do Better'. At 5pm on Sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available, according to the Labour website . Labour MP Diane Abbott, a former frontbencher in Mr Miliband's health team, condemned the mugs - and policy- as 'shameful' A Labour spokesman said: 'Labour has five election pledges. This is one of the election pledges.' Mr Miliband was tackled on immigration last week as he appeared on the first TV contest of the election campaign. Told that the last Labour government's figures on the numbers expected to come to Britain were 'farcical', he admitted: 'Yes, they were wrong. I think that we benefit from our diversity, immigrants over the years have made a big contribution to our country but we do need proper controls. But he refused to set a limit on the number of people he thought could live in Britain before it was full. 'I'm not going to get into your hypotheticals,' he told interviewer Jeremy Paxman on the Sky News/Channel 4 programme. Challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: But am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.' The 'hell yes' slogan has also been seized on by the Labour party, which has had it printed on t-shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers. Challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions, Mr Miliband shot back: 'Am I tough enough? Hell yes, I'm tough enough.' The slogan has been put on t-shirts now being sold by the Labour party . David Cameron has come under fire after promising 'no ifs, no buts' to cut net migration to below 100,000. But latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Some senior Tories urged Mr Cameron to ditch the pledge, but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long. You see that on school places, and you see that in some places on the health service. 'I can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this, 'I hear you, I hear your concern, I get your message. He insisted he sticks to his pledge: 'you can call it an ambition, you can call it a target. That is what I want to achieve.'",

        "article": "Barcelona may never have been here today. Not the team harboring the awesome power of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez up front. Not the club who have won four European Cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them. Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction . The awesome trio of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez may not have been assembled if not for O'Connell . Not Luis Enrique's side who are aiming to knock Manchester City out of the last 16 of the Champions League. All of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for Irishman Patrick 'Paddy' O'Connell, who as a player captained the red side of Manchester during five years at United from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up City's two-legged fixture with Barcelona a century later. O'Connell is credited with rescuing Barcelona from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940. Barcelona have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was O'Connell that saved the club . In Spain, he became known as 'Don Patricio' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading Racing de Santander to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of La Liga. He took charge at Real Oviedo and then won the Spanish title at Real Betis, but his greatest legacy was shaped when Barcelona came calling. After just one season at the Catalan club, the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and the country was in chaos. O'Connell (back row, far right) pictured for Ireland against Wales in 1914/1915 . On the streets of Barcelona, anarchy was escalating. As the tanks rolled in, football was flattened in the country. La Liga was suspended and, despite playing in and winning the Mediterranean League, cash was running out fast. The club were facing financial ruin. O'Connell orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $1,500 to $1,000 - but Barcelona were still heading out of business, until the wily Irishman had a bright idea. Barcelona celebrate with the Champions League trophy following victory over Manchester United in 2009 . Former Barcelona captain and defender Carles Puyol  holds the Champions League trophy in Rome . He took the team on a tour of Mexico and America, playing 14 games and raising $5,000 - the equivalent of $83,000 today. It was little, but enough to survive. By the time the war ended in April 1939, O'Connell had dragged the team back from the brink of oblivion. Why then would this Barca legend  come to die alone and penniless in London 20 years later? While O'Connell is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes, on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest. 'He was the hero in one way but also the swine who left his family in poverty,' his grandson Mike remembered. 'There are two sides to it, a sad family story, but I'm proud he was my grandfather.' O'Connell (back row, one from the left) as part of the Hull City team in 1913-14 . O'Connell was a gambler and a misogynist; a chancer, swindler and trickster. He played for Belfast Celtic, Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City before impressing Manchester United enough for them to pay \u00a31,000 for his services in May 1914. The same year he captained Ireland to the British Home Championship, playing the final game against Scotland with a broken arm. O'Connell was a brash, brazen, no-nonsense centre-back and was made captain of United straight away. However, the first season was a catastrophe and they avoided relegation from Division One by a single point. Even worse - a victory against Liverpool in April was deemed fixed. Puyol holds up the Club World Cup trophy after victory against Santos FC at the tournament in Yokohama . Sandy Turnbull and Enoch 'Knocker' West photographed in 'cricketing' pose at Old Trafford in 1911 . The First World War had broken out and no football was to be played the following season. A group of United and Liverpool players, fearing unemployment and what the future held, met in a pub the day before the game and agreed to the more unlikely 2-0 United win and bet on it at odds of seven-to-one. The scam was uncovered when the Football Association investigated claims of a lack of effort from Liverpool players. United's Sandy Turnbull, Enoch West, Arthur Whalley, and Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were banned indefinitely by the FA. Former Barca man Cesc Fabregas holds the  UEFA Super Cup after beating Porto at Louis II Stadium . Bob Pursell was banned after rigging a game to win money when Liverpool faced Manchester United . Liverpool's Jackie Sheldon was one of those players banned indefinitely by the FA . Liverpool's Thomas Fairfoul was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams . O'Connell struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2-0, but somehow avoided punishment. Yet O'Connell's family admit that maverick streak ran through him. It was these scrapes and scraps which shaped an eventual legend. 'He was an incredible success as a footballer but as a man he was probably a bit of loveable rogue,' Mike's wife Sue explained. 'As a father he was a non-starter.' He remained a United player through the war and after it ended had a year at Dumbarton before moving to Ashington in 1920. David Beckham is one of 40 players who have supported a fund  to raise money for a fitting memorial . O'Connell was determined to find success in football and would let nothing stand in his way. Not even family. He left his wife Ellen at Newcastle station in 1920 after she had travelled there to plead with him to return home. It was the last time O'Connell would see her and he married again in Spain, another Irishwoman called Ellen. At Ashington, he was made player-manager and had his first taste in running a club, before the sniff of adventure took him abroad. Johan Cruyff has also supported the plea to get O'Connell a more fitting memorial following his death . But for all his heroics in Spain, when O'Connell returned to England in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in London a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave. Last year, a fund was set up to raise money for a more fitting memorial. So far, more than 40 notable football names have supported it, including Sir Bobby Charlton, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Paolo Maldini and David Beckham. There is a bust of O'Connell in the FC Barcelona Museum. There, he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club. AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini is one of more than 40 players to support the memorial idea .",

Michael Jones, who was charged along with two other US teenagers, will not be eligible for parole until he is 56-years-old. Jones, who was the driver of the car from which a bullet was fired at Lane, begged for forgiveness as he was sentenced a minimum of 38 years in prison, the ABC reports. Lane, 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship. American Michael Dewayne Jones has been sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for his involvement in the killing of Christopher Lane . The two other teens, charged with first-degree murder and accessory in the first, will face court next month. They were 17 and 16 at the time of the baseballer\u2019s death. In December 2013, in the first courageous interview since her son\u2019s death, Lane\u2019s mother Donna Lane told the Daily Mail she doesn\u2019t care what happens to the teens charged with killing her son. 'It's not going to bring my Chris back,' she said. Ms Lane told how she had shed tears every day for her only son, admitting that even though he had been living in the US for the past four years her life in Melbourne has been empty knowing he's never coming back for a visit. At her home in the suburb of Pascoe Vale, lying between Melbourne city centre and the airport, Donna opened a photograph album put together as a special memorial for her by his friends in the US. Lane (left and right), 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship . Right there on the first page was a shot that makes her so proud - Chris in his baseball strip crouching, waiting for a catch. 'He was always good with the ball almost as soon as he could walk,' she said, turning the pages, smiling at one of him poking his tongue out at the camera. 'I'm not at all surprised he ended up as such a talented player. 'I know that his friends see him as a brilliant catcher and while he might be a super-hero to them he's still my son and what strikes me all the time is that even though he's so special I can't have him back. 'People ask me all the time what I think about the three who have been arrested in connection with his murder. But do you know what - I don't care. Donna Lane, mother of shot Australian baseball player Chris Lane, holds a framed Christmas card he and his girlfriend Sarah Harper had sent her on an earlier, happy festive season . Chris Lane with his girlfriend Sarah Harper during a visit to Australia, when Sarah took the opportunity to cuddle a koala . 'I don't care if they go to prison for life or if they walk free again. Whatever happens to them isn't going to bring Chris back. I'm not interested in what happens to them. 'What's the point of looking for some kind of retribution? How is it going to change things for me and my family? 'My friends tell me that if those three do walk free they might do it again, you know, hurt somebody else, but whatever happens over there now still doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever. 'What's done is done and I can't turn the clock back,' the devastated mother added. Chris was on a scholarship at the East Central University as a team catcher when he was killed.

Sean Price, has been charged with stabbing Vukotic to death in a park in Melbourne on Tuesday evening. Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio on Friday: \u2018I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn\u2019t be alone in parks. Scroll down for video . Masa Vukotic who loved\u00a0pink and 'Lolita Japapese fashion' was murdered at 7pm on Tuesday evening in a Melbourne park . \u2018I\u2019m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.\u2019 The service posted on its Facebook advice to people to try to stay safe that included warnings to stay in well-lit areas if travelling through parks 'late at night.' Victoria's Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, Fiona Richardson, led the criticism of Hughe's comments. She said he 'undoubtedly has the best interest of women in mind and made comments on radio this morning out of care and concern for women, who are all too often victims of crime.' 'However, hearing a senior police officer say that, as a woman you are not safe going about your leisure activities or daily business, is a sad indictment on our society. 'The community conversation needs to be about stopping men from committing these terrible crimes in the first place, not just about women need to protect themselves.' Community members were quick to point out that Masa was killed at 7pm on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile, devastated friends of Vukotic, who was stabbed to death while exercising in a park, have vowed to wear pink in her honour. Friends of murdered schoolgirl Vukotic have paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci' on Facebook and organised a picnic memorial in a park for the \u2018beautiful, loving, sweet, smart, charismatic and hilarious young woman with a bright future ahead of her\u2019. On Thursday, as 31-year-old man Sean Price was charged with Masa's brutal murder, Victoria Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio: \u2018I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn\u2019t be alone in parks. \u2018I\u2019m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.\u2019 \u2018The safety of all members of our community is a priority to Victoria Police. We ask that everyone, male or female, take a common sense approach to their safety,\u2019 the police Facebook post said. \u2018If you\u2019re walking through a park late at night, stay close to well lit areas or walk with friends where possible. Don\u2019t shut yourself off to the world, keep one ear free when listening to music and keep your valuables secure. We simply ask that everyone stay alert and stay safe.\u2019 Facebook user Pete Bannan replied: \u2018It's purely sad that people innocently walking need to be reminded of this.\u2019 Angel Egginton said: \u2018This is all well and good but someone was attacked in Doncaster in broad daylight... It doesn't matter anymore we aren\u2019t safe anywhere.\u2019 Carla Regan responded: \u2018I have a 6 year old daughter and it scares the hell out of me that one day I will have to let her take on this world alone. This poor girl was going about her daily exercise and was murdered in cold blood, it makes me cry.\u2019 Victoria Police posted a warning on their Facebook page which asked people to try and not be alone in a park at night . 'Everyone who met you loved you marci, you're gone but will never be forgotten,' one of her friends wrote on Facebook . Masa Vukotic, 17, was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she was walking on a footpath near her Doncaster home - in Melbourne's east. Pink flowers and a pink rabbit were left at the scene . Erin Manderson said: \u2018I understand the common sense safety message, but the timing of this message is wrong. It validates the victim blaming mentality that so many people already have. Thousands of people walk or run day and night with earphones in and should be able to continue to do so without fearing that the person jogging behind them is going to stab them. Awful. Love and strength to her family and friends.\u2019 And Jade Eastwood blasted: \u2018I'm sorry but I hardly consider 7pm late at night!\u2019 Ms Vukotic was murdered just five minutes from her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east on Tuesday. Ms Vukotic, known affectionately by her friends as 'Marci', was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve just before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'. On Thursday, Melbourne man Sean Price, 31, was charged with her murder. Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police. One of Marci's friends drew this beautiful illustration of her holding her pet rabbit Roger . Marci's friends have begun posting photos of themselves wearing pink on Facebook in a touching tribute to the murdered teen . In a Facebook event post for the memorial tribute, Ms Vukotic's friends wrote: \u2018On the 28th of this month, we will be holding a memorial for our dear friend. Please, invite your friends to come. No alcohol or drugs are permitted as this is strictly a memorial event. Marci needs to be remembered - her name needs to be known. She was an amazing influence on so many lives.\u2019 The memorial picnic will be held at Queen Victoria Gardens and will be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'. Her friends are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japapese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related' as she was so fond of her pet rabbit, Roger. 'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. On Wednesday night more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found. 'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said. Using the hashtag #pinkformarci her friends drew these touching tributes of Princess Marci.

        "article": "There has long been tradition for mothers to pass on beauty lessons to their daughters. But now, mums are just as likely to ask their daughters for advice \u2014 particularly because the boom in online beauty bloggers means that young people have access to professional techniques at their fingertips. All you need to do is Google \u2018smoky eye\u2019 and you\u2019ll find dozens of videos showing you how to do it. It\u2019s no surprise that these online beauty gurus have legions of followers, and two of the biggest YouTube stars are Norwich-based sisters Sam and Nic Chapman, whose Pixiwoo site has millions of viewers worldwide. When I met the girls, they were quick to credit their mother Judy, 58, with giving them some of the best tips they still follow. Nic (left) and Sam Chapman (right) credit their mother Judy (centre) with giving them some of their best beauty tips which they still follow . Judy, too, loves having make-up artist daughters and readily admits that some of the best tricks she has learned have been from Sam and Nic. With Mother\u2019s Day coming up, I met with Judy, Sam and Nic to learn their top tricks. SAM, 37, AND NIC, 34: MUM HAS TAUGHT US . . . Always remove your make-up. Dirt builds up on the skin throughout the day and it blocks your pores and leads to breakouts. Cleanse thoroughly before bed to remove both dirt and make-up \u2014 it will also keep your pillowcases clean! Moisturise twice a day and remember to apply the cream to your neck, too \u2014 our neck and hands are often the first places to show signs of ageing but they are nearly always forgotten. Dry skin is common in our family, so for us it\u2019s extra important to moisturise properly. We also use a more intensive treatment in the evening. Mum taught us to stay out of the sun. Too much sunbathing leads to wrinkles and age spots in later life. As a family, we have porcelain-pale skin so have always been cautious about lying out in the midday sun. Have your eyebrows shaped professionally. Overplucking can give you a startled appearance and once you have made a brow mistake, it can take years for them to grow back. Finally, the best tip we\u2019ve learned is to drink plenty of water. Alongside the obvious health benefits, staying hydrated shows in our skin, too. It helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture. JUDY CHAPMAN: MY DAUGHTERS TAUGHT ME . . . Choose the correct moisturiser for your skin type. It\u2019s easy to just grab any one, but you need to make sure you are using something that is tailored to your skin. I am lucky because the girls help me shop for foundation. However, if you struggle to choose the correct shade you should try it along your jawbone and then go outside into the daylight to check how well it blends into your skin. Nic (left) and Sam (right) say their mum, Judy (centre), taught them to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water as it helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture . Thin eyebrows can be so ageing and mine are a little overplucked from embracing the thin brow trend in the Seventies. Now the girls have taught me how to cheat my way to fuller brows with a brow pencil, I have a more youthful look. The importance of blending with a foundation brush cannot be underestimated. I couldn\u2019t be without my Real Techniques Expert Face Brush (\u00a39.99, Boots). The wide, firm bristles make it easier to apply and smooth foundation. Finally, use an eyeshadow primer. My eyelids are quite oily and my eyeshadow often creases, so when Sam and Nic taught me to layer eye products, starting with an eyeshadow primer, it totally changed my look. TREATS TO MAKE MOTHER\u2019S DAY MARVELLOUS . Olay\u00a0limited edition vintage design . In time for Mother\u2019s Day, Olay has launched a limited edition vintage design (\u00a35.99, Boots).

Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Mr Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. The 22-year-old says he struck up a conversation with Mr Huxley while walking home in the early hours of the morning. Scroll down for video . Morgan Huxley (pictured) was fatally stabbed on September 8, 2013 at his\u00a0Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday . He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, \"Do you want to talk about it?\". 'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, \"Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to\".' Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury. Jessica Hall (middle) - the ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley - gave evidence at\u00a0Daniel Jack Kelsall's murder trial in Sydney last week . Rebecca Prins, who was dating Morgan Huxley in the months before his death, is pictured leaving the NSW Supreme Court after giving evidence . After talking for a while about Mr Huxley's work, which 'wasn't going so well', Kelsall said he asked the 31-year-old \"Do you want to do things with me?\" The pair then went upstairs to Mr Huxley's room. 'He (Mr Huxley) came in after me and turned off the lights and he immediately dropped his pants.' With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed.\u00a0Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis. 'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said. Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment . Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week . 'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran. 'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder. 'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. The trial continues.

        "article": "An 80-year-old driver who killed a grandmother when his foot slipped on the accelerator was seen laughing outside court after being handed only a \u00a3500 fine and a two-year driving ban. Thomas Gidman hit his neighbour Irene Wills, 75, in his Ford Focus, crushing her against a wall. The grandmother of three had to have her leg amputated and died in agony in hospital six days later, leaving her husband of 52 years bereft. Yesterday Joe Wills, 77, told of his anger and astonishment that Gidman had escaped \u2018scot-free\u2019 with only a \u2018slap on the wrist\u2019 over his wife\u2019s death last September. Wheelchair-bound Thomas Gidman, 80, from Stoke-on-Trent, (pictured above with friends outside court) was sitting in his stationary car when  his foot slipped on the accelerator and the vehicle crashed into Irene Wills . 'A two-year driving ban and a \u00a3500 fine for taking my wife's life is ludicrous,' he said. \u2018I\u2019m not an awful person but if you lose your wife you expect more than this. 'Everybody thought it was going to be in the crown court but he has been given a slap on the wrists. Mr Wills, from Norton, Stoke-on-Trent, did not attend court earlier this week after being told by police that the matter was likely to be transferred to the Crown Court. However, Gidman pleaded guilty to causing Mrs Wills\u2019s death through careless driving at his first appearance at North Staffordshire Justice Centre, and was immediately sentenced by magistrates. 'I was waiting for the case to be sent off to crown court - I thought it was impossible when I heard he had been sentenced on Tuesday,' said Mr Wills. 'The charge should have have been much more serious - it is shocking. \u2018I actually thought they were kidding me. He has got away scot-free for killing my wife. \u2018We had the best life together and it was cruelly snatched away like this and all he gets is a slap on the wrist, and has the cheek to laugh about it. I am still distraught and really very angry that justice has not been served. I will love Irene until the day I die. I just cannot believe that a life can be that cheap.\u2019 Irene Wills (pictured above with her husband Joe), died aged 75, after being pinned against a wall by Gidman's car after his foot slipped on the accelerator. She had a leg amputated but died from her injuries . Chairman of the bench Howard Ball told Gidman: \u2018We feel no amount of fines or other community activity is going to change this very, very sad situation.\u2019 Outside court, wheelchair-bound Gidman was seen laughing with friends. Magistrates heard Gidman was waiting for his daughter in his car in a doctor\u2019s surgery car park when his foot slipped on to the accelerator. The car leapt forward in a 90-degree arc, propelled by \u2018high-level harsh acceleration\u2019, crossed a road, then hit Mrs Wills, a retired kitchen assistant, as she walked just yards from her home. The court heard how witnesses reported a 'high-level harsh acceleration' of a car before it crashed into Mrs Wills. She was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where medics were forced to amputate one of her legs but she died six days later. At the court hearing yesterday, prosecutor Andrew Bodger said: 'Mr Gidman had been to the surgery close to the scene of the accident. He got in the car, which was an automatic, while his daughter went to a chemist's shop nearby to fetch a prescription. 'The Ford Focus with the defendant at the wheel shot forward out of the car park in a 90 degree arc and ended up hitting Mrs Wills who was walking along Knypersley Road. Gidman (pictured outside court) admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention and was handed a two-year driving ban and fined \u00a3500 . 'She suffered very severe injuries and had to have part of her leg, above the knee, amputated. 'Right from the outset the defendant said his foot had slipped from the brake pedal on to the accelerator.' Mr Wills, a retired National Union of Mineworkers regional president, met his wife when they were teenagers. They married in 1962, aged 21 and 23, and had one child, Valerie, three years later. Their daughter, who lives in San Francisco with her family, said Mrs Wills had only stepped out for a \u2018breath of fresh air\u2019 when she was struck by the car. Police investigators found Gidman\u2019s vehicle had no mechanical defects. Simon Dykes, defending, said Gidman suffered a \u2018momentary lapse in concentration with tragic circumstances\u2019. He added: \u2018Mr Gidman knew the lady involved in the collision which makes it more difficult for him. He has been absolutely devastated by what has occurred.\u2019 The court heard Gidman handed in his driving licence the day after the collision. He was not using a wheelchair at the time. All driving licences expire when the holder turns 70. To continue driving, motorists need to renew their licences before they turn 70, then every three years after that. But there is no requirement for them to re-take their driving test or have their licence reviewed because of their age. Sarah-Jane Martin, of road safety charity Brake, said: \u2018Statistically, older drivers are less likely to be involved in a crash as they are more experienced and tend to take fewer risks. \u2018However ... Brake believes fitness to drive regulations need to be strengthened to prevent needless tragedies, particularly through the introduction of compulsory sight checks. \u2018When someone admits causing death by their own careless driving, it should warrant a penalty that properly reflects the severity of the crime and its impact on others. \u2018Anything less is likely to serve as an insult to bereaved families, and does little to encourage people to take greater care behind the wheel and prevent future tragedies.\u2019 Joe Wills, 77, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said he had lost 'the best wife in the world' and expressed disappointment at Gidman's punishment. He said:\u00a0'A ban and a \u00a3500 fine for taking my wife's life is ludicrous' As well as being banned from the road for two years and fined \u00a3500, wheelchair-bound Gidman was also told to pay \u00a385 costs at the hearing. Irene's daughter Valerie, who has three children, said: 'I'm heartbroken. My mum was my best friend. 'Even though I live in California we would speak every day.I'm really going to miss her. When she went outside - it was just to get some fresh air. 'My mum was a kind, caring and incredibly loving. Her grandchildren love her to bits and call her Grammy. 'She loved my dad. They were inseparable. They were best buddies and it breaks my heart because now my dad's on his own.'",

        "article": "A pledge to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax is to be revived by the Conservatives in their general election manifesto. Official forecasts suggest the number of families paying death duties will double over the next five years unless the current threshold of \u00a3325,000 is raised. Leaked Government documents suggest that the majority of estates currently liable would be lifted out of tax under plans drawn up for the Tories. The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Lib Dems . The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to \u00a31million before the 2010 election, prompting the Labour government to allow married couples effectively to combine their allowances to \u00a3650,000. The Chancellor's plan to raise it further was killed off by the coalition with the Lib Dems, who insisted that raising the personal income tax allowance should take priority. David Cameron believes families who do not feel 'in any way mega-rich' are being dragged into the tax bracket, according to Government sources. One option is to create a new tax free band worth \u00a3175,000 per person on a family home, that could be transferred between married couples, making it worth a maximum of \u00a3350,000. The leaked documents show that by adding the existing maximum combined allowance for couples of \u00a3650,000 to the new maximum relief of \u00a3350,000, properties up to \u00a31million would escape inheritance tax. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) said the Tory plan was 'very cynical' The paper, written by officials for the Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke, notes the scheme will be 'very popular with the public'. 'It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to \u00a31million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances,' the paper states. 'This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house, particularly in London and the South East, paying inheritance tax.' It estimates that by 2019-20, around 20,000 fewer estates a year would be liable for any inheritance tax. Critics of the duty say that money bequeathed at death has already been taxed, so should not face further charges. They also point out that the super-rich often employ accountants to devise trusts and exemptions to reduce their liability. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Tory plan was 'very cynical'. 'If taxes can be cut \u2013 and it's very difficult within the present budget constraint \u2013 we've got to start at the bottom with people on low pay, not at the top,' he said. A revival of the inheritance tax pledge would be another pitch to the 'grey vote' that could prove crucial in May's election. The policy was credited with a surge in support for the Conservatives in 2007, which helped scare Gordon Brown into abandoning plans for a snap election. Experts pointed out that the Treasury has suggested the inheritance tax threshold will remain frozen until 2017-18 to help pay for the introduction of a new cap on the cost of social care. By the following year, it is forecast to be worth almost \u00a36billion a year to the Exchequer.

Two 17-year-olds boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested \"on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,\" the Metropolitan Police said. The investigation started on Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials on Friday, and that night, the individuals landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped, along with another person who had been regarded as suspicious by Turkish intelligence working at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three arrived back in London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. \"When we have intelligence shared with us there is no problem. We stop them and directly deport them. And of course Turkish intelligence is always on the lookout as well,\" the Turkish official said. Turkey on Thursday arrested a person who worked for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service on suspicion of helping the girls, according to Turkey's foreign minister. On Friday, a Turkish television network aired a video purportedly showing the girls preparing to cross the Turkish border into Syria. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Arwa Damon and Karen Smith contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Labour supporters demanding an end to trivial speculation about their leader's kitchen are in for a disappointment: Ed Miliband has invited the cameras into his home again. Days after it emerged his \u00a32million house has a large family kitchen and a smaller 'functional kitchenette' upstairs, ITV is expecting to film him relaxing in at least one of them. Confusion about why the family have two kitchens deepened today, when it emerged that the larger family kitchen picture on Mr Milband's Christmas card last year is in fact used by the live-in nanny. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room . Mr Miliband tried to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements on Friday, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras as part of a short film about his wife, Justine. The poky room the couple were pictured in last week, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail . 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' But now it has emerged that the kitchen will appear on screens again. ITV has already filmed David Cameron and Nick Clegg at home. An ITV told the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Cameron and Clegg have already been filmed in their kitchens and elsewhere and we are due to begin filming in Ed Miliband's home in the next day or two. We were always going to shoot in the family kitchen so we shall have to see what happens.' It was also claimed that the second bigger kitchen is used by the live-in nanny who looks after the couple's children Daniel and Sam. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in the paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen . Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day . Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.' Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.",

Mrs Danczuk - the wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk - looked tired as she entered Manchester Airport this morning to fly overseas. She left the UK after it emerged her brother, who she has accused of abusing her when she was still a schoolgirl, has been re-arrested over further sex abuse claims by two other women. Karen Danczuk walks into Manchester Airport this morning as she heads off on a break with a friend . Mrs Danczuk flew away for a break  three weeks after she first made the allegations public, before making a complaint to the police. A source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country.' Last month, Mrs Danczuk \u2013 who became well-known for posting revealing 'selfie' pictures of herself on Twitter \u2013 claimed she was raped by a family member \u2018hundreds of times\u2019 between the ages of six and 12. She did not name her attacker initially, but her brother, Michael Burke, was later arrested. Last week, the 36-year-old vehemently denied the claims, saying: \u2018The allegations are false. I\u2019m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.\u2019 Mrs Danczuk, 31, has said she starting posting \u2018selfies\u2019 after feeling she can now \u2018have fun without being ashamed of myself\u2019. Mrs Danczuk has claimed a member of her family abused her when she was young. Her brother Michael Burke was later arrested but has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is 'shocked and disgusted' by the claims . Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said yesterday: \u2018A man has been rearrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences. \u2018This relates to officers speaking to a woman on February 16, 2015, regarding historic sexual abuse and new information coming to light. He remains in police custody for questioning.\u2019 It is not known when the fresh offences are alleged to have taken place. But Greater Manchester Police were already investigating Mr Burke over claims that he sexually abused his sister between 1989 and 1995.

The crew said they did not sense any deceleration from the wheel brake upon landing, despite the auto brakes being set to \"max,\" according to an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The runway appeared all white in the moments before landing, according to the report. They based their decision to land after receiving a brake action report of \"good\" from air traffic control, the NTSB said. \"The automatic spoilers did not deploy,\" the crew told the NTSB, \"but that the first officer quickly deployed them manually.\" The captain said he was unable to stop the aircraft from drifting left, according to the report. The Boeing MD-88 sustained significant damage to the left wing, flight spoilers, the nose of the plane and the left wing fuel tank, according to the NTSB. Delta Flight 1086 departed from Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later. The aircraft briefly circled New York because of issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. The plane slid off the runway with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Twenty three passengers received minor injuries, and others were transported to the hospital for evaluation. An NTSB meteorologist is examining the weather conditions at the time of the accident, said the report. The cause of the accident has not been determined.",

A set of triplets have been arrested after a schoolgirl was shot in the hip by a stray bullet during a stand-off between two vehicles. Tyrese Thomas, Terry Thomas and Terrance Thomas, all 18, were involved in the shootout in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, police said. One of the bullets hit Precious Marshall, 17, as she was walking home from softball practice around 5.10pm. She said she was on her way to a prom dress fitting and was 'puzzled' when she heard gunfire. 'I paused like \"oh my god what am I going to do?\" My mind was telling me run, but my body wasn't moving,' she told WKYC.com. When Miss Marshall, who knew the suspects when she was younger, realised she had been hit she ran inside the nearby Glenville Recreation Center. She was taken to the MetroHealth Medical Center but the bullet could not be removed as it was too close to her spine. It is not known whether Miss Marshall will have to have an operation but she said she can no longer play softball. The triplets were arrested around five hours later. Miss Marshall, who is still on crutches, said she thought she saw someone jump out of a black car before the shooting began. The other car is thought to be red. She added: 'Police should be around more. Like every corner.' Tyrese Thomas (left) and\u00a0Terrance Thomas (right) have also been arrested.

        "article": "A leading liberal clergyman has come under fire from traditionalist Anglicans after allowing a full Muslim prayer service in his church. Reverend Giles Goddard, vicar of St John\u2019s in Waterloo, central London, joined in the event by reading a passage from the Bible at the \u2018Inclusive Mosque\u2019 event. He then asked the congregation to praise \u2018the god that we love, Allah\u2019, it was reported last night. Reverend Giles Goddard, vicar of St John\u2019s in London, held an\u00a0'inclusive mosque' event during which a full Muslim service was hosted inside his church (pictured, painting a cross on the church for Ash Wednesday) It is thought to be the first time an entire Islamic service has been held by the Church of England and has sparked criticism from evangelical clerics. Orthodox clergyman said the event was against canon law, which prohibits any divergence from the official liturgy. They argued that it could be \u2018offensive\u2019 to Christians who are persecuted for their faith. Rev Goddard defended his decision to hold the event, describing it as a \u2018very moving\u2019 service. He said his intention was simply to offer people a \u2018place to pray\u2019. He told the Christian Today website that everything his church did was legal and within bishops\u2019 guidelines. Mr Goddard said he was simply offering the Muslims a place to pray, adding that the religions share 'the same God' (pictured, St John's) He added: \u2018It is very much about St John\u2019s being a place of welcome. We understand God as a generous God, a God who celebrates love and celebrates life. \u2018We try and make sure we live that out. In that sense we feel very properly Anglican.\u2019 The \u2018Inclusive Jummah\u2019 was held in partnership with the Inclusive Mosque Initiative. It was organised to coincide with the run-up to International Women\u2019s Day last weekend. The service was arranged by Dr Amina Wadud, a campaigner for gender justice in Islam. Rev Goddard said the service had not put off Christian churchgoers and his congregation is growing. He told the Daily Telegraph: \u2018We are offering a place for people to pray so it made absolutely perfect sense. We should be offering [a place] to party, we are the Church of England. \u2018They could have gone to a community centre, I suppose, but they loved being in a church, they were just really pleased and delighted to have the welcome and it was very moving, really.\u00a0It is the same God, we share the same tradition.\u2019 At the end of the service, the vicar read a section of Psalm 139 and said: \u2018This is from the Hebrew scripture \u2013 we all share these great traditions, so let us celebrate our shared traditions, by giving thanks to the God that we love, Allah.\u2019 Rev Stephen Kuhrt, vicar of Christ Church, New Malden, said: \u2018I am appalled by islamophobia and when people whip up anti-Muslim frenzy, but the vicar of St John\u2019s Waterloo has done something that is completely illegal, which is to allow an Islamic service to be held in his church, and then he has participated as well.\u2019 Critics say Rev Goddard has overstepped his bounds by introducing other faiths. Rev Robin Weekes, the minister of Wimbledon\u2019s Emmanuel Church, said: \u2018The issue is not primarily that canon law has been broken, which it has, but that it is offensive to Christians who believe that there is only one God.\u2019",

        "article": "A 29-year-old woman who once weighed as little as 39 kilos has revealed how she transformed her figure to become a bodybuilding champion \u2013 and why she has refused to give up the gym after becoming pregnant. In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she\u2019s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I\u2019ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,\u2019 Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet \u2018only swelled up once\u2019 and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been \u2018tuna with vinegar\u2019. Scroll down for video . 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go':\u00a0Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay . The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010 . Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. \u2018My training became more about core strengthening than building,\u2019 Marika said. \u2018Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage \u2013 about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,\u2019 she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before . Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition . \u2018Physically I\u2019ve made peace and listen to my body now and I\u2019ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it\u2019s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.\u2019 Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. \u2018I was tiny just through lack of knowledge\u2026 health wasn\u2019t a priority it was just about making money,\u2019 she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include: . Morning . An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch . Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack . Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner . White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise . Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'. After she became pregnant with her first child, Marika took advice from her chiropractor, midwife and physio and adapted her workout routine and diet. Morning . Multi-grain bread, oats, or muesli with fruit. Or eggs on toast. Snack . Greek yoghurt and nuts. Or a nut and muesli bar when nauseous. 'I couldn\u2019t even think about eating chicken and greens. The thought of it just made me want to throw up, it was a big adjustment,' Marika said. Lunch . Tuna as well as fresh fruit. Dinner . Similar to before pregnancy. 'I started to think cravings were a myth and I only had indigestion once in my whole pregnancy,' Marika said. 'I also alkalised my body with alkaline greens, that\u2019s really important to help prevent acid reflux. 'Also fish oil capsules have helped with my brain function and baby's developing brain.' Exercise . 'I didn\u2019t really change until the 10 week mark and then I really started to slow down a bit and reduced my weights to four days a week. 'The second trimester I did about three days a week of strength training then a walk or cycle on the other three days just because I felt better being active. 'In the third trimester I have tapered right back to two or three weight sessions a week up until the 36 week mark where I thought \"OK I just cant\u2019 do it any more\". 'I had to find an alternative, with walking and prenatal yoga and walking in the lap pool.' \u2018I was in advertising and marketing and worked in the corporate world for a good few years and then decided to transition into a personal trainer because I loved my fitness and wanted to combine my passion with work so I could be happy all the time,\u2019 Marika said. The brunette had always been active and ran cross country at national level at school and struggled to gain weight. 'Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off,' says Marika who has a naturally small frame . Marika explained this photo was taken on 'one of leanest days' of her life while she was competing in bodybuilding . Marika said she has received a lot of criticism online from people who 'aren't educated around the topic' Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding . \u2018I didn\u2019t feel womanly so I sort of talked to a girlfriend and made the move into the gym to get more toned. I felt skinny fat and she said \u201cyou just have to do some weights and you won\u2019t be so skinny any more\u201d,\u2019 Marika recalled. Her friend was pregnant while they trained together and Marika was guided by a coach for her move into competitive body building. Her coach, John Davies, taught her to eat high-protein foods and carbohydrates as needed. The knowledge she learned then has helped her through her pregnancy. For example, while feeling nauseous in the first 12 weeks she would snack on a nut or muesli bar to give her strength. As she awaits the arrival of her baby boy, Marika\u2019s midwife told her \u2018being fit has helped you\u2019. Marika's partner Luke Schembri is also a competitive bodybuilder. They had these portraits taken ahead of the arrival of their first child . Marika, from Sydney, is happy and healthy ahead of giving birth and feels no pressure to get straight back into competing after giving birth . But the fitness fanatic is not putting any pressure on herself to get back into competing shape any time soon, instead she\u2019s planning to take her time and support her partner Luke Schembri \u2013 also a competitive bodybuilder \u2013 with his competitions. \u2018There is a lot of stress on your body during birth and a lot of nurturing that needs to be done\u2026 it\u2019s going to be a milk truck as well,\u2019 she laughed. Marika said she has received a lot of criticism online from people who \u2018aren\u2019t educated around the topic and who feel entitled to an opinion\u2019 but emphasised everyone should seek their own professional advice before attempting training. \u2018A lot of people won\u2019t know their body as well as I know my body and there were even times when I thought I was doing the right thing and found out I wasn\u2019t,\u2019 she said.",

It was thanks to Hart's heroics that Barcelona could manage only a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp.

Barcelona (4-3-3) Ter Stegen 8 . Excellent handling and produced an important save from Aguero\u2019s penalty. Alba 7.5 . Looked solid at left back.

The epitome of a winger playing full back \u2014 defending is the last thing on his mind. Pique 7.5 . Looked very classy at the centre of defence. Excellent passing and positioning. Mathieu 7.5 .

Rescuers found the toddler Saturday hanging upside down in the car, which had crashed into a frigid Utah river a day before. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25. Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. \"(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home.\" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. \"She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,\" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: \"I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.\" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. \"I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,\" said Trafny. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.",

        "article": "A mother racked up \u00a345,000 in debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online bingo while she was off work sick. Kelly Nield, 32, would gamble for eight hours at a time and drained all the money she and her boyfriend had saved up together. Her addiction became so bad that she began to have suicidal thoughts and turned to self harm after worrying about how she would ever escape the habit. Scroll down for video . Kelly Nield racked up \u00a345,000 debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online gambling . Mother-of-one Ms Nield, from Billinge, Merseyside, said:\u00a0'You get to the point where you can't see a way out. 'It's a vicious cycle as when you win get the buzz to play again, and when you lose you just want to get your money back. 'I just wanted to find a way to make myself stop and when my thoughts turned dark I knew I had to get help.' She first stumbled across bingo while watching The Jeremy Kyle Show when she was signed off sick from her job as a childcare worker in 2012. Foxy Bingo was advertised with a bright, brash logo on the daytime television show, luring Ms Nield in before she went on to use other sites too. 'You can go on and do it in your own home in comfort and to begin with it's not a big deal,' she said. The mother-of-one would play for eight hours non-stop while she was signed off work sick . 'I'd been to bingo with friends in the past but not spent more than about \u00a320. It had never been an issue before. 'But they always let you win something to begin with or offer you free plays. In just over six months, I was \u00a310,000 in debt.' Ms Nield's online bingo habit quickly spiralled out of control, and the first thing she would turn to in the morning was her smartphone, where she could get her kick within seconds. She said: 'I would gamble from the second my family left in the morning until they came home at night, and when they were home I would sneak off to the bathroom and bedroom to play. 'My partner would come home and comment that the house hadn't been touched and it was because I'd be sat on it all day, gambling. 'For the first two years I put everything on credit cards. Because I was off and suffering with stress, I don't really remember it. I think I was just blocking out what was going on . 'I know the difference between right and wrong so now I think what on earth was I doing.' The mother took out more credit cards, arranged more overdrafts on her bank account and began to dip into the family's savings. 'I've ended up with five credit cards in total - one for \u00a310,000 and the others all have around \u00a35,000 on them,' she said. 'I'd maxed them all out by the end of 2013 and then until the middle of 2014 I was using any cash I could get my hands on. 'I managed to get a \u00a31,600 overdraft on one of my accounts and I just spent it. 'My partner and I were saving around \u00a3500 a month and I would just access the accounts and spend what I could. Now we're left without any savings at all.' Eventually she came clean to her boyfriend Ian Nairn, 37, and she started seeing a doctor to help her tackle her addiction. Now Ms Nield, who is paying off \u00a3300 of debt a month, is now calling on the gambling industry to rein in its adverts, which are aired on television throughout the day. Ms Nield is now undergoing counselling after kicking the habit, and is paying back \u00a3300 a month to clear her debts . She said: 'They target vulnerable people and make them believe they can make money from gambling. 'I understand some people gamble and have no issues. But many people have a problem and this destroys lives, families and even drives people to suicide. 'It destroys people and leaves them with long term debts, depression and stress. 'No-one gives you anything for nothing in this world and something needs to be done about it.' Dirk Hanson, CEO of gambling support charity Gamcare, said: 'We applaud people who come forward and admit that they have a problem with gambling. 'We encourage people to get support either for themselves or for family members or friends who might be struggling. 'There is help available out there either through support groups or through one-on-one counselling. 'We know that women in particular are drawn to online forms of gambling and they are more likely to access these services online. 'We offer an online chat service through our helping where people can anonymously come through and chat with one of our advisors. 'It is a reality that people can get hooked on these websites, and people should be fully aware of the risks before getting too involved.' Foxy Bingo have been contacted for comment.",

        "article": "The Football Association are confident the FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Reading will draw a much larger television audience than Manchester United\u2019 s Premier League trip to Chelsea after revealing the matches will clash. Just 10 minutes separate the kick-off times of two of the biggest games this season, with the FA Cup encountering an awkward conflict on what is supposed to be a standout weekend for the competition. Arsenal face Reading at Wembley on Saturday April 18 at 5.20pm for a place in the FA Cup final, with Chelsea hosting United at Stamford Bridge at 5.30pm the same evening in a hugely important Premier League encounter. Marouane Fellaini competes with Gary Cahill  during the Barclays Premier League match  at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho faces Louis van Gaal with points on the line for the title race and Champions League spots . Much of the build-up to that slot will focus on Jose Mourinho facing Louis van Gaal, with points on the line for the title race and Champions League qualification. Arsenal\u2019s game against Championship Reading may play second fiddle in the eyes of many neutral football fans. But FA sources insist viewing figures for their match, broadcast on the BBC, will far outstrip the Premier League contest shown on Sky. United v Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals managed peak figures of 8.9million people. The terrestrial advantage in this battle is highly significant. Arsenal players celebrate after beating Hull in the FA Cup final at Wembley last year . Blackburn players salute their fans after they earned an FA Cup replay against Liverpool . The BBC had first pick of the semi-finals and elected for the time and day that is likely to yield their greatest TV audience. The scheduling of the Premier League match would not feature heavily among considerations. BT Sport picked up Aston Villa\u2019s semi-final against either Liverpool or Blackburn and that will kick-off at 3pm on Sunday April 19. It does mean an trickier trip home by train for northern supporters than a Saturday fixture would have represented, but it is understood Metropolitan Police were reluctant to have Liverpool and United fans potentially travelling to and from London Euston at similar times. Many supporters ran on to the pitch after watching Reading beat Bradford to book an FA Cup semi-final spot . Aston Villa fans celebrate victory on the pitch after beating West Brom in the FA Cup sixth round .",

        "article": "I do not have a problem with giving second chances to disgraced athletes. Redemption stories can provide some of the most uplifting moments in sport and in the past few years I have come to admire Dwain Chambers, a man who will always be known as a drugs cheat, for the way he responded to his downfall. Third chances are a little more difficult to wrestle with. Recidivism suggests a predilection for cheating the public and one\u2019s fellow competitors that is harder to forgive and which makes it more troublesome to believe that the athlete has reformed. Sprinter Justin Gatlin signed a lucrative sponsorship contract with Nike this week . Gatlin has twice been convicted of using performance enhancing drugs . Gatlin's deal with Nike has been met with some unfavourable responses from key figures in athletics . What I really have a problem with, though, is rewarding an athlete who has cheated twice with a big, fat sponsorship deal. What I really have a problem with is somehow legitimising the taking of performance-enhancing drugs in sport by making a cheat look cool. That\u2019s what Nike have done. That\u2019s the message they have sent out by giving a new sportswear deal to twice-convicted drugs cheat Justin Gatlin in the build-up to this year\u2019s World Championships in Beijing. Nike don\u2019t do shame. They just do shock. But they should be ashamed of themselves for this. They should be ashamed of the message they are sending out at a time when athletics desperately needs its stance on PEDs to be unequivocal. Nike are cool. They make it their business to make their athletes appear cool, too. They turn them into people their youth-orientated customers want to emulate. And now they are going to do that with USA sprinter Gatlin who, in the absence of Usain Bolt, ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the world last year. Cheats do prosper after all then. Let\u2019s remind ourselves about Gatlin. He was first banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs in 2001 after testing positive for amphetamines. Gatlin claimed he had been taking medication for Attention Deficit Disorder. His two-year ban was reduced. He won gold in the 100m at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Then, in 2006, he tested positive again. He never admitted guilt. His then coach, Trevor Graham, blamed a massage therapist for rubbing cream laced with testosterone into Gatlin\u2019s buttocks without his knowledge. It was \u2018the-dog-ate-my-homework\u2019 stuff. Gatlin was banned for eight years this time, a punishment subsequently cut in half. Gatlin won gold in the 100m at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece . Gatlin is now 32 but despite his age, is posting some of the fastest times on his career . That should have been enough to put him out of the range of endorsement deals for the rest of his career. But it\u2019s not enough for Nike, apparently, even though they did drop Gatlin after his second positive test. They seem unconcerned. They even seem a little surprised that anyone\u2019s bothered. \u2018Earlier in his career,\u2019 Charlie Brooks, Nike\u2019s vice president of communications for North America told Reuters, \u2018Justin served the ban that was imposed on him and has been competing again for almost five years.\u2019 Here\u2019s another thing. Here\u2019s the thing that Nike don\u2019t say. Here\u2019s the thing that makes what they are doing even more cynical, even more pathetic. Gatlin is 32 now, a little old for a sprinter, but for some reason, he is managing to run even faster than he was when he was taking performance-enhancing drugs in his prime. Nike still seem to think it\u2019s worth making Gatlin one of the faces of their brand. They\u2019re desperate, I suppose. Usain Bolt, the man seen as the saviour of athletics, runs with a Puma on his chest. Nike are taking a hell of a beating so they\u2019re gambling on a two-times drug cheat to get them back in the game. Even Paula Radcliffe, a fellow Nike athlete, sounded appalled. \u2018I am very disappointed to hear this news,\u2019 wrote Radcliffe. \u2018I don\u2019t believe it truly reflects the core values of the Nike I am proud to represent, nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that I work with on a daily basis.\u2019 Paula Radcliffe, who is also sponsored by Nike, revealed her dismay at the news of Gatlin's deal . Last year, Gatlin ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the absence of Usain Bolt . To talk about Nike\u2019s integrity and ideals is rather generous. The deal with Gatlin reinforces the idea that Nike\u2019s integrity begins and ends with making money. Their ideals? Please, don\u2019t make me laugh. If Nike really had any ideals that extended beyond maximising market share, they would not have gone anywhere near Gatlin. It would have known that in the wake of the Russian doping scandal that afflicted athletics last year and added to the cumulative effect of so many previous scandals, the most powerful groups in the sport needed to take a strong stance. Nike have done the opposite of that. They have caved in to commercial pressure. They have bowed to greed. In the grim struggle against drugs in athletics, this is Nike\u2019s contribution: Just Blew It. Ten\u00a0days ago, rookie linebacker Chris Borland quit the San Francisco 49ers at the age of 24 and turned his back on a multi-million dollar contract. He had started thinking about leaving the NFL after getting his \u2018bell rung\u2019 and suffering another minor concussion. He did some research, read about the NFL veterans suffering from dementia, and decided it was time to get out. \u2018I just honestly want to do what\u2019s best for my health,\u2019 Borland told ESPN. \u2018From what I\u2019ve researched and what I\u2019ve experienced, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk... I\u2019m concerned that if you wait until you have symptoms, it\u2019s too late.\u2019 Chris Borland quit the San Francisco 49ers at the age of 24, believing it was best for his health . George North was knocked out for the third time in six weeks playing for Northampton on Friday . North (third right) lies motionless after being knocked out as Wales lost to England in the Six Nations . I thought about Borland yesterday morning when I read that George North had been knocked out again following a blow to the head during Northampton\u2019s victory over Wasps on Friday. Six weeks ago, North appeared to be knocked out twice in the course of Wales\u2019 Six Nations defeat to England at the Millennium Stadium. That\u2019s some serious damage to his head in a very short space of time. I wonder if he knows Chris Borland\u2019s story and if he ever thinks about getting out before it\u2019s too late? Some of Lionel Messi\u2019s most enthusiastic and dedicated followers have become so desperate to proclaim him the best there has ever been that they have started to claim triumphs for him where they do not exist. The little genius of Barcelona has won the Champions League twice but say that to some and they become disproportionately outraged by what they interpret as a vicious calumny. This kind of disproportionate outrage, of course, is the lingua franca of social media but it does not change my opinion that you are not entitled to say you have won the Champions League or the European Cup unless you played in the final. Lionel Messi has played in and won two Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011 for Barcelona . Messi (left) scored a header for Barcelona in the 2009 final against Manchester United . Messi won the competition with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 but missed the 2006 quarters, semis and final through injury. That means he has won it twice. His furious supporters claim that because he played in previous rounds, he is counted as a winner in 2006, too. Because we live in inclusive times, the Barcelona and UEFA websites back up that up. However, Roy Keane does not feel he deserved to be called a Champions League winner when he missed the final in 1999. I understand Paul Scholes feels the same. Gary Neville played in the final when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich that year but also appeared in a quarter-final the season United beat Chelsea in Moscow. Messi is not considered a three-time Champions League winner as he missed Barcelona's 2006 final . Messi (left) celebrates winning the Champions League in 2011 for Barcelona at Wembley . He travelled in the squad to Moscow but did not make the final 18. Neville does not consider that he has won the Champions League twice. Perhaps the final word should go to Messi. \u2018I feel a champion of Spain much more than I feel a champion of Europe,\u2019 he told Graham Hunter in his book, Barca, at the end of the 2005-06 season.

        "article": "Their plight was summed up on the whistle. After a game Millwall just had to win in order to retain any hope of survival, the supporters warmly applauded as they trudged off. The fans realise what dreadful circumstances interim manager Neil Harris has pitched up in. It was better but ultimately not enough. The Lions looked every bit a side to have scored just three goals in their previous eight games; plenty of huff, but very little puff. Had Brighton\u2019s Joe Bennett not crashed the bar from 25 yards and later blazed wildly over, it might\u2019ve been worse. Millwall now look consigned to relegation and upbeat Harris will treat the remaining eight fixtures as an audition for when the club make a permanent decision on Ian Holloway\u2019s successor in the summer.

Referee: Andy Woolmer . Attendance: 9,105 . \u2018The boys couldn\u2019t give me any more apart from a goal,\u2019 he said. \u2018The support they gave was absolutely terrific. We\u2019re just trying to give them the belief, to get the fans back onside.\u2019 Harris believes this is already a side the fans can identify with again after disaffection under Holloway. \u2018I wasn\u2019t always the best player on the pitch here but I played with my heart on my sleeve,\u2019 he added. \u2018We maybe lacked a little bit of creativity in the final third and we\u2019re searching for a goal to kickstart us. \u2018The league table doesn\u2019t lie - games are running out. You have to start somewhere. We need to add to that. \u2018We\u2019re in a difficult position but we\u2019ve got games to win.\u2019 This isn\u2019t fair on the young boss. It could well be a case of right job, wrong time for the man who\u2019s adopted the club for which he appeared in the 2004 FA Cup final and who stood right behind him when beating testicular cancer.

These were small steps in a mission to rejuvenate themselves, and something Chris Hughton has noted. \u2018They started well,\u2019 the Brighton boss said. \u2018I expected that. They\u2019ve got a very good club man in the job at the moment. Everybody here respects him.\u2019 Respect means Harris won\u2019t be implicated in the probable relegation, and for now he\u2019s just intent on putting smiles back on some faces.

Tribute: The Duchess, 33, was at St. Paul's with husband Prince William for a service commemorating the men who died in Afghanistan . Windy: She also had some trouble with her hat, thanks to the chilly March breeze that sprang up . As she made her way outside, the Duchess went over to speak to the families and exchanged smiles with some of the brave fighters before joining the crowds outside for a flypast. She also spent some time chatting to a glamorously dressed Duchess of Cornwall, with the two apparently enjoying a friendly, if rather animated, conversation. Earlier, Kate had appeared moved as she sat beside husband Prince William and his brother Prince Harry to hear the tributes paid to the 453 men and women who died while serving in Afghanistan. The service was held to mark the end of combat operations in Afghanistan after 13 years, with the final British battalions pulled out and sent home last autumn. Harry, who served two tours of duty in the country, looked particularly solemn as Prime Minister David Cameron spoke of the 'outstanding bravery' of the men and women who fought. 'We take pride in the scale of their achievements, driving out Al Qaeda and building up the Afghan forces so they can begin to take control of their own security,' he continued . Light relief: The moment was one of the more light-hearted of a morning that had focused heavily on the sacrifice of UK troops . Safely down: The Duchess of Cambridge walks down the steps of St. Paul's accompanied by Prince William and Prince Harry . Contemplation: The Duchess had looked enormously moved as tributes were paid to the men and women who died .

Paying attention: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stand to attention as the planes soar overhead . Warm: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chat to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall following the service . 'Thirteen years on, the terrorist threat to our country from the region has been substantially reduced. Our families are safer because of what our Servicemen and women have done.' But the British withdrawal came too late for some, among them\u00a0Cpt Thomas Clarke, 30, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, 38, and Cpl James Walters, 36, all of the Army Air Corps, who were among the last to perish in the conflict. The service, which was led by the Prime Minister and the Queen, involved almost every senior member of the royal family, among them the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Also seated in Sir Christopher Wren's magnificent cathedral was Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York. The Princess Royal, who looked wonderful in her military uniform and cockade hat, was also at the service and, afterwards, travelled back to Gloucestershire for the final day of the Cheltenham Festival. During the service, a cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar. Officer Cadet Noor Aziz, from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, read a recital before the Archbishop of Canterbury blessed the Camp Bastion cross for its new memorial at the Royal British Legion's National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Prince William shares a piece of chocolate with Logan Prior, who sits with his mother Emily at the reception for veterans and families of fallen soldiers this afternoon .

Sarah Bushbye, former Corporal of the Army Medical Services, Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards who was killed, and Darren Fuller, former Colour Sergeant of the Parachute Regiment also said a prayer. Afterwards, the congregation made its way outside to see five detachments made up of serving personnel from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and the Royal Marines take part in a parade ahead of the flypast. They marched in silence past St Paul's accompanied by military bands and pipes and drums, with Prince Charles taking the royal salute, through the centre of London to Guildhall. Among those watching in silence was Kate, who will join the military for a second time in less than a week when on Tuesday, she and William pay their annual St. Patrick's Day visit to the Irish Guards.

        "article": "They like Manchester band The Courteeners at Old Trafford. Upon winning their 20th Premier League title fans had the words of their song 'Not Nineteen Forever' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the Theatre of Dreams. But in the case of forgotten man Ander Herrera and his triumphant return to the side, the Middleton four-piece's earlier hit 'What Took You So Long?' would be more appropriate. Ander Herrera (centre) is starting to make an impact for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side . Herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow Spaniard Juan Mata, who scored twice against Liverpool . What took you so long Louis van Gaal? Why was Herrera, suddenly a key player in United's new-found swagger, out of the picture for long chunks of the season? There is more than one answer. Firstly, if anyone is a 'club signing' it is Herrera. Long before the coronation of King Louis, United originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in Athletic Bilbao' 2011-12 Europa League victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The admiration from within spread to the stands. They have never been shy of praising opponents at Old Trafford \u2013 this was where, in 2003, Ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful Champions League hat-trick for Real Madrid. The 25-year-old was signed from Athletic Bilbao in a \u00a328.8million move following Van Gaal's arrival . Herrera made a bright start to his United career, but injury saw the Spaniard sidelined for several weeks . In that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer David Moyes famously made one attempt to capture Herrera's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player's contract could not be overcome. But they would not give up. When Van Gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with Herrera's representatives and he was happy to give the \u00a328.8m move the green light with the new season approaching. United have paid more for only four others, but as we have heard more than once, under Van Gaal's philosophy the fee counts for nothing. Former United boss David Moyes made an attempt to capture Herrera's services, but failed . The Spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to Van Gaal during his first season at Old Trafford . Herrera celebrates scoring during United's FA Cup fifth round victory against Preston in February . Not being the Dutchman's player, Herrera may have had to prove himself more than most. In a stuttering start to the season, he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half-time against West Bromwich Albion. As late as February he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5-3 humbling at Leicester City in September. With their team struggling for rhythm United fans who remembered Herrera conducting the tune for Bilbao, scratched their heads at his continued absence. When he made a rare start in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Deepdale on February 16 many put it down to Van Gaal's squad rotation. Herrera's partnership with Daley Blind (right) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield . But Herrera has started every game since, the kickstarting of his Old Trafford career coinciding with United finally clicking into gear. His partnership with Daley Blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield. Suddenly United appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors. Herrera's through ball for Juan Mata to open the scoring against Liverpool came in a dominant half of football United fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago. But there is more to it than Herrera simply not being the boss's signing. In a wide-ranging interview with El Pais, he offered more clues. Herrera and Mata chase down Philippe Coutinho during United's 2-1 victory against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata puts the ball past Simon Mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from Herrera . 'Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk [losing] the ball,' he said. 'He wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place, because the team have the quality to find you. 'At the beginning he used to tell me off because I always looked for the ball, I wanted to have it, and I must wait for it.' Van Gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff \u2013 that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win. Michael Carrick (left) congratulates Herrera on the part he played in Mata's opening goal . It is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the NFL by New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, whose team this year won their fourth Super Bowl this century. While it does not sound like the famous United Way, it certainly looked like it at Anfield. Herrera, superb on Merseyside, believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism. By the looks of things, he has plenty of new chapters to write at Old Trafford first.",

In one scrap yard in the city of Hangzhou, an incredible 100,000 vehicles have piled up after being taken off the road because they did not meet the national emissions standard. A similar picture can be seen right across the country. These amazing photographs on People's Daily Online show the sheer scale of China\u2019s car graveyards. From above, the eclectic collection of cars and trucks could almost be mistaken for the pieces of someone\u2019s giant toy set. Five and a half million cars will be scrapped this year because they are high emission vehicles, contributing \u00a310.8bn to the recycling industry. By 2020, it is estimated that 16 million vehicles will be ready for the scrap heap. China\u2019s booming car industry means some 154 million cars are now on the country\u2019s congested roads. A massive 17 million were sold in 2014 alone, making up a quarter of global sales. In an attempt to slow down car sales, Chinese authorities have cut the number of new vehicles that can be registered on the roads. Last year the number of new registration plates available in Beijing fell from 240,000 to just 150,000. It has been said that by 2017, only 90,000 plates will be issued for ordinary cars and the rest to eco-friendly cars. Sea of metal: An aerial view of a junkyard in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province. As China is stepping up environmental protection levels to fulfill its commitment of curbing pollution, an increasing number of pollutive vehicles have been removed from roads and scrapped .

        "article": "Lewis Lowe, pictured, stole the \u00a360,000 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS from outside solicitor Paul Ackroyd's home and took it on a 100mph joyride . A car thief wrote off a lawyer's luxury Porsche during a 104mph police chase - not realising it was a model so rare it was one of only four in Britain. Lewis Lowe, 24, stole the 2011 911 Carrera GTS in broad daylight after spotting the car parked on the driveway of personal injury specialist Paul Ackroyd who at the time was on a family ski-ing holiday in Austria. Just half an hour later, Lowe, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, was spotted by police driving the \u00a360,000 car - described as Mr Ackroyd's 'pride and joy' on the M60, and a six-mile high speed chase commenced along the motorway. Lowe weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph, forcing cars to move and slow down dangerously, before he attempted to move on to the A666 towards Bolton at the same speed. The high-powered vehicle eventually slewed out of control and ended up in bramble bushes on the embankment where it was damaged beyond repair. Tragically, it later emerged father of three Mr Ackroyd, 46, had been planning to take his 11 year old disabled son Edward on a road trip in the Porsche around the Scottish Highlands on return from the skiing trip, as the boy's disability meant he had not been able to go to Austria. At Manchester Crown Court, Lowe was jailed for two years after earlier admitting aggravated vehicle taking, burglary, dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance. After the case Mr Ackroyd a founding partner of a law firm in Rochdale said: 'I got a call when I was away on holiday from the tracking company. You just feel so helpless. The first thing I wanted to know was whether they had been on the house or just stolen the car. It was devastating to find that they had been in the house as well. 'It had taken me a long time to find that car. There were only four on the market and it had taken me nine months to find the right one. I love motoring and cars are my passion. It was the special edition so it was a really special car. I only bought the car in October last year and the kids loved it. 'Edward is terminally ill with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and he in particular adored the car. In many ways I bought the car because of him. He couldn't come on holiday with us in January so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the Scottish Highlands in the car. 'It is only a car but it meant so much to him. It has been very upsetting. I drive a Volvo estate as my everyday car and the tour in Scotland wouldn't be the same in that car.' The court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on January 23 after opportunist Lowe spotted the Porsche and sneaked around the outside of Mr Ackroyd's cottage in Oldham to establish it was empty. He smashed through patio doors and helped himself to iPods, a PlayStation3 and the keys to the car before driving away in it. Lowe broke into Mr Ackroyd's home, stole electronic goods as well as his 'pride and joy' Porsche 911 . Mr Ackroyd was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around Scotland in the car . The car, pictured, was written-off after Lowe lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment . Shortly afterwards Mr Ackroyd who had a tracking device fitted inside the Porsche, got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move. Prosecuting, Juliette Berry said: 'The police having received information about the stolen car saw it on the M60 in Prestwich. Officers from the Tactical Aid Unit notified other colleagues. 'The defendant realised the police had seen him and while still on the motorway accelerated away and drove in and out of traffic. They activated the emergency equipment and a pursuit commenced. He tried to negotiate to the slip road at 100mph, left the road and hit the embankment causing the vehicle to stop. The airbags were deployed and the vehicle was damaged. Lowe tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day. The tracking device fitted to Mr Ackroyd's car later provided evidence that Lowe had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of Slaithwaite at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash. Miss Berry added: 'The Porsche was worth \u00a360,000. I understand it is particularly rare. There were only four in the country and the impact upon Mr Ackroyd has been significant. He was on holiday with two children. The third child is disabled and was unable to go. Father and son had planned a road trip around the Scottish Highlands in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset.' In a statement, Mr Ackroyd said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they don't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security. Defending Lowe, who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences, Sara Haq said: 'He expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he can't find in the community. The defendant is glad to be there. 'He accepts that he was looking for something to steal that day and came across a house that was clearly unoccupied with an attractive vehicle on the driveway and he took the opportunity.' Sentencing Judge Maurice Greene said: 'There were only four in the country of this particular type of car. You were tempted by this vehicle and drove it away. You were seen by the police but decided to try and escape because you were, I suspect, looking for the excitement of driving at speed. 'A \u00a360,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for Mr Ackroyd as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house. That's the traumatic effect a house burglary has. It's not always what is taken but the intrusion to a place people are entitled to feel safe. It is really by luck more than anything else neither you nor other people were killed.' Lowe was jailed for two years at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, after admitting the theft . After the case Detective Constable Adam Frank said: 'It is a miracle that Lowe did not kill either himself or someone else. He drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car, I have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality. 'He also showed no signs of slowing down or giving himself up until he crashed into an embankment, suffering only the indignity of some scratches from the brambles he tried to run through and the cuff marks when we arrested him. 'I am pleased to see Lowe behind bars, not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people's homes. I am sure the streets are much safer with this reckless and foolhardy individual behind bars. 'But also for the family who have suffered tremendously from Lowe's actions. He invaded the sanctity of their home, stole their property and wrecked a very expensive car. I know from speaking to them just how traumatic this has been for them, to the point where the three children have been so badly shaken up they refuse to now stay in their own home. 'That is the type of crippling effect burglars like Lowe can have so I am really pleased he has been convicted and is now firmly behind bars where he belongs.'",

        "article": "The execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row , Kelly Gissendaner (pictured), was delayed because the lethal injection was 'cloudy' The execution of the only woman on Georgia's death row has been postponed at the last minute for the second time in less than a week - because the drug used in the lethal injection she was scheduled to receive was 'cloudy'. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, was due to be given an injection of pentobarbital at a Jackson prison  at 7pm on Monday in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997. But after officials observed the drug had a 'cloudy' appearance, they postponed her death until a future, unspecified date 'out of caution', according to reports. Earlier on Monday, Gissendaner had feasted on a massive last meal of two Burger King Whoppers, two large portions of fries, cornbread, a fatty salad, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream. It is the second time Gissendaner has been spared death from lethal injection. On February 25, officials postponed her execution as a winter storm was due to hit the area. It was unclear whether she received her whopping, 3.400-calorie last meal at that time. Monday's decision came as the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether or not to grant Gissendaner a stay of execution after a last-ditch appeal for clemency was denied by state officials. On Monday night, a Department of Corrections spokesman told the Gwinnett Daily Post: 'Prior to the execution the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. 'The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits. Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. 'The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, inmate Gissendaner\u2019s execution has been postponed.' More than 100 protesters were gathered outside the prison where Gissendaner was  to be executed, pleading with officials to spare the mother-of-three's life. Riot police were also reportedly stationed outside the facility. Scroll down for video .

Praying: Michael Patter, senior minister at Central Congregational United Church of Christ, prays silently during a vigil for Gissendaner, who made headlines across the world with her 3,400-calorie last meal request . Murder: Gissendaner (pictured, left, in her arrest mugshot from 1997) is due to be executed for plotting the murder of her husband, Douglas. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen (right) who carried out the deed, will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against Gissendaner in trial . Gissendaner, who made headlines globally with her 3,400-calorie last meal request, would have become the first female to be executed in Georgia in 70 years if the injection had gone ahead. Her attorneys had recently launched a final attempt to\u00a0persuade the state's Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her death sentence to life without parole. They were backed by a petition, which had gained over 70,000 signatures by Monday evening, saying Gissendaner\u00a0has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree behind bars. Nearly 400 clergy members, who signed the petition, had highlighted Gissendaner's acceptance of 'full responsibility' for her crime, as well as her graduation from the program for incarcerated women at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, through which she became a teacher. However, on Monday afternoon, the board announced it was standing by its February 25 decision to deny clemency to Gissendaner, whose last meal included a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing. It said it had voted to abide by its earlier decision after 'careful consideration' of her case. The Supreme Court was still deciding whether to grant a stay of execution on Monday night. Gissendaner had been denied clemency at a hearing last week, but her lawyers had argued that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade the board to change their minds. Previous attempts have rested on the inmate's remorse and new-found faith. In a statement ten years ago,\u00a0Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die.' She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing the death penalty - and will, in fact, be eligible for parole in eight years. Indeed, although her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed her husband, Douglas, at her urging, he could be freed in just eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against her. Gissendaner's death via lethal injection was previously scheduled to take place last week. However, it was canceled after a 'rare'  storm caused disruption in the area, closing schools and businesses. Monster meal: Gissendaner (pictured, above, eating a regular prison meal) requested an enormous spread for her last meal, including two cheeseburger meals, two large orders of fries, cornbread, popcorn and ice cream . Locked away: Gissendaner (pictured  in 2004) has been locked up for the past 17 years after her conviction . If executed, she would have become the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. In their motion, Gissendaner's lawyers noted that the parole board had already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency. But, her lawyers argued, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.' The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison. Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote. Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation. Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on her behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year. Petition: Gissendaner's attorneys were backed by a petition , which had gained more than 70,000 signatures by this evening, saying Gissendaner has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree behind bars . 'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on January 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution. Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years. 'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote. Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial. The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote. 'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote. Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters wanted her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote. In statements submitted with their mother's clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner described a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness. 'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family. Saying a prayer: On Monday evening, a Twitter user named Rachel wrote: 'Praying for #KellyGissendaner, may she find the love and mercy our broken systems could not find for her. #kellyonmymind' Angry: User Kir Alexandra questioned reports of police in riot gear being dispatched to the prison in Jackson . The petition for Gissendaner's clemency, which was launched by Jeania Ree Moore, described the inmate as a 'powerful voice for good' who has 'lived a life of purpose' since her incarceration. 'While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,\" the document stated. 'Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce.' It urged members of the public: 'Do not let this travesty of justice happen on your watch.' On Monday evening, the hashtag #KellyOnMyMind was going viral on social media.",

He withdrew $800 from his account and hasn't been heard from since. The tradesman's white Holden Rodeo ute was discovered by local workers in scrubland about 95 kilometres south west of Coober Pedy, South Australian Police confirmed on Wednesday. Mr Kowalski had claimed that he planned to stay at the Victoria towns of Wilsons Promontory or Leongatha until December 19 before he set off on his road trip. Scroll down for video .

The car is being transported to Coober Pedy to be examined by South Australian Police in a bid to discover what happened to Mr Kowalski. Inspector Ian Humby said that Police were intensifying their search for any information on Mr Kowalski's whereabouts. 'Today, with assistance of SES and CFS together with STAR Group, we'll be doing searching in the vicinity between the Stuart Highway and the location where the car was found, doing searches in that whole vicinity trying to find any evidence we can to try and find out where he might be,' Mr Humby said on Thursday. 'We're also examining the car and any of its contents for any information that might help.' 'At this time there does not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.' His family and friends have led a tireless campaign to bring Dane home and have spoken out after the latest development. 'Dane's car has been found in scrub land off the Stuart Highway in South Australia,' his family and friends wrote on their Facebook page, set up to help locate their missing mate. 'It appears he got bogged. 'Dane's family and some close friends are heading to Coober Pedy now to assist and search. We all have fingers crossed and are praying this enables us to bring Dane home. 'Please keep all speculation to yourselves'. According to a Facebook post on the 'Find Dane' Facebook page, it appears the vehicle became bogged . After Dane's car was found his friends posted this photo on Facebook, captioned, 'We're coming to find you Dane. We'll never give up hope. Time to bring you home, mate' Dane hasn't touched\u00a0his phone, bank account or social media accounts since he went missing . The Melbourne man's loved ones said they were focussing of remaining hopeful after the car was uncoverd. 'We are all overwhelmed with emotion and want to thank everyone for their love prayers and support. 'Good luck boys and Danes family lets \u202a#\u200ebringdanehome!!

We'll never give up hope. Time to bring you home, mate'. His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way. They have vowed not to stop until they find him. For three months his friends have campaigned tirelessly, imploring everybody to spread the message about Dane's strange and distressing disappearance . Any sign, big or small, leading people to their website or raising awareness is necessary . Dane Kowalski, 27, left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin . In attempt to find Dane, friends have set up a website and started a social media campaign, as well as printing shirts and stickers with his face on them. One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media \u2013 nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' There has been no trace of the 27-year-old since that day: His phone and bank accounts remaining untouched . His friends and family have considered hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said. One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Dane's family that he may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,'\u00a0Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said . It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records. Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him. 'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's okay. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home,' Ms Taylor said. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' 'He's one of the most amazing people you'll ever meet; he'd give you everything he had if he knew he could help you. You can't say a bad word about him, you really can't. He really loves life.' Dane is described as being of Caucasian appearance, approximately 185cm tall, of athletic build with blue eyes and undercut brown hair. He was driving a white 2004 Holden Rodeo ute with the registration WN114. Anyone who sees Dane is urged to contact Triple Zero (000) immediately. The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. Now, his friends and family are considering hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. Four of the much-loved man's friends returned home two days ago after driving from Melbourne to Darwin, handing out missing posters and looking for signs of their missing friend. They flew back to Darwin on New Year's Day to continue their search. 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home.

        "article": "Dozens of hardline Labour MPs will work with the SNP to hold Ed Miliband to ransom and stop him making any cuts to public spending, it was claimed today. The left-wingers have pledged to vote against any Budget that includes austerity measures to tackle the deficit. John McDonnell, chair of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs, said \u2018a bloc of 30-40 left MPs\u2019 in Labour will ensure Mr Miliband will not be able to \u2018ignore\u2019 their demands. Scroll down for video . Former First Minister Alex Salmond - who is standing for the SNP in Gordon, was out campaigning today . Mr Salmond has boasted that the SNP will hold the balance of power in the Commons after the next election . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said that she has already been in contact with MPs on the left of the Labour Party to plot how they could work together. Former First Minister Alex Salmond, meanwhile, has boasted that the SNP will hold the balance of power in the Commons after the next election and will be able to force Labour to increase spending, borrowing and debt. Mr McDonnell has held talks with Mr Miliband and said he has already \u2018moved the party on to our agenda\u2019. In a recent meeting, he told Mr Miliband that any government he leads could be \u2018the most radical\u2019 and \u2018perhaps more radical\u2019 since Clement Attlee. He claimed Mr Miliband had agreed. Mr McDonnell said that if Labour falls short of a majority it would have to abandon its pledge to impose spending cuts because of the pressure from left in the party. Ed Miliband will struggle to stop dozens of hardline Labour MPs from working with the SNP to stop cuts to public spending, it was claimed today . He told the New Statesman: \u2018The first row will be around austerity unless we get this right... I think it will change, inevitably it will change. \u2018I think it will be clear from pressure coming back from constituencies and individual MPs that we need a Labour government quickly making a change.\u2019 Mr McDonnell said there has already been \u2018a shift in terms of the Labour leadership\u2019s thinking and even in terms of Ed Balls\u2019s thinking\u2019. He added: \u2018You\u2019ve got to offer an alternative. You can\u2019t come in with austerity-lite, it won\u2019t work. John McDonnell said \u2018a bloc of 30-40 left MPs\u2019 in Labour will ensure Mr Miliband will not be able to \u2018ignore\u2019 the hard-left in the party after the election . \u2018Coming in with arguments that you\u2019re going to cut services, not necessarily as much as the Tories, but you will still be cutting services, I think that argument is beginning to creak, I think that argument is beginning to fade. \u2018Increasingly now, the Labour leadership has recognised that, actually, you can tackle the deficit over a longer period of time, that way you avoid any cuts whatsoever.\u2019 Mr McDonnell said that a \u2018large number\u2019 of Labour\u2019s candidates for the General Election were on the left and could help vote against the renewal of Trident. He added that he is \u2018more optimistic now about the role of the left in the Labour Party than at any time in the last 20 years\u2019. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: \u2018This is the true face of Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour Party: they\u2019re addicted to more wasteful spending and more taxes. 'If Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister he\u2019ll be carried there by Alex Salmond, bankrolled by Len McCluskey and pushed around by his own backbenchers. It would cause chaos for Britain.\u2019 Mr Miliband has ruled out the possibility of going into a formal coalition with the SNP, but the two parties could agree a post-election deal. Labour peer Baroness Prosser today said that the two parties could work together on an issue by issue basis. She told the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics: \u2018I think that is just how pragmatic politics works.\u2019 On Sunday, Miss Sturgeon said the SNP could be in a 'very powerful position' at Westminster after the election. Mr McDonnell, 63, who has been the MP for Hayes and Harlington since 1997, is chair of the Socialist Campaign Group and Public Services Not Private Profit Group. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on the campaign trail at Glasgow Fort shopping centre today . In 2010, he announced his intention to stand for the party leadership following the resignation of Gordon Brown, but later decided instead to back Miss Abbott\u2019s unsuccessful leadership bid. He rebelled against the government on controversial votes, such as the Iraq war and top-up fees. Mr McDonnell, who left school at 17, served as a National Union of Miners and TUC official, before being elected to the Greater London Council in 1981, where he served as Ken Livingstone\u2019s deputy. In November last year he was criticised after he joked about how people in Tory minister Esther McVey\u2019s Wirral West constituency had asked why they were not \u2018lynching the b******\u2019.",

        "article": "(CNN)To beat the world's best golfers you often have to be flawless -- and that's what Inbee Park managed at the HSBC Women's Champions tournament, playing 72 holes without dropping a shot. The South Korean triumphed by two strokes from teen prodigy Lydia Ko, who took Park's world No. 1 ranking last month -- at 17 the youngest player of either gender to reach the summit. Ko, born in Korea but raised in New Zealand, had to settle for second place at Sentosa in Singapore on Sunday -- International Women's Day -- after winning her previous two events. \"She played great all week,\" Ko said of her 26-year-old rival, who will stay second when the new rankings are released next week. \"No bogeys around here and on a course where you can hit a good shot and you can get bad luck. That's pretty phenomenal.\" Park, who finished 15 under par, won not only $210,000 for winning the LPGA event but also $7,500 from a bet with her dad -- with the stakes at $500 for a birdie and $1,000 for a bogey. \"This week was just incredible,\" said Park, who has held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 73 weeks in two periods and now has career prize money of nearly $10.3 million. \"I don't think I can even believe myself that I didn't make any bogeys for 72 holes.\" Park led the tournament from start to finish, and closed with two-under-par 70 -- a score matched by Ko -- as she claimed her 13th LPGA Tour title. She has now played 92 holes without dropping a shot, going back to the third round of last week's Honda LPGA Thailand, where she tied for seventh. \"It's good to have a family here and they are big energy,\" said Park, who got married last October. \"This week just went so quick. I didn't have to think about golf when I'm not on the course, so I think that was a big help.\" Former world No. 1 Stacey Lewis finished third, two shots behind Ko, as the American finished with a par 72. \"It was fun being in the final group.

        "article": "The decorated Boston police officer who was shot in the face during a routine traffic stop has been upgraded to a stable condition following successful surgery to remove the bullet from his neck. Officer John Moynihan, 34, was placed in a medically-induced coma and listed in a critical condition after being shot below his right eye at point blank range in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday night. The suspect, Angelo West, 41, was  gunned down  by other cops in the city's Roxbury area. He was declared dead at the scene, while a female bystander is recovering from a bullet wound to the arm. Now, Moynihan has been upgraded to a 'stable and improving condition' after undergoing several hours of surgery to remove the bullet that lodged behind his right ear during the 'unprovoked' attack. Scroll down for video . Victim: Officer John Moynihan, 34,\u00a0who was shot in the face during a routine traffic stop, has been upgraded to a 'stable and improving' condition following  surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, police have said . Expressing gratitude: Boston Police Department said in a tweet to well-wishers: 'To all who are sending thoughts and prayers to #BPD and Ofc Moynihan we say thank you. Your prayers are much appreciated' Hospital: Moynihan is expected to be moved out of Boston Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in 'coming days' following his improvement. Above, the cop's colleagues gather outside the hospital after the shootout . He is\u00a0expected to be moved out of Boston Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit in 'coming days', Boston Police Department said in a statement on Sunday, in which it praised medics' efforts. 'I\u2019m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans said in the document, posted on the force's website. 'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center.' On Sunday morning, the police department, alongside other officials and members of the community, held a special service to pray for Moynihan and his family at Saint Patrick's Church in Roxbury. 'He's a fighter, he's going to pull through,' Evans said at a press conference on Boston on Saturday. Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, police said. West, traveling with two others, allegedly shot the officer in the face at point-blank range without warning. He then started shooting at other cops, but was killed when they returned fire, it is said. Suspect: The suspect, Angelo West (pictured, above, following a prior arrest), 41, was shot dead by other police officers in the city's Roxbury area. A female bystander is recovering from a bullet wound to the arm . Scene: On Sunday, the police department, alongside members of the community, held a special service to pray for Moynihan and his family at Saint Patrick's Church in Roxbury. Above, the car West was traveling in . Emergency response: Moynihan was attacked by West after he approached the driver's door of a car that he and five other gang task force members had pulled over following reports of shots fired in the area, it is said . During the attack, the suspect, from Hyde Park, reportedly fired so many bullets that he emptied his revolver, according to the\u00a0Boston Globe. He was later revealed to have had a violent criminal past. None of the officers with the Youth Violence Task Force, including Moynihan, had drawn their guns when West opened fire, Suffolk DA Dan Conley said at the press conference on Saturday. The woman at the scene who suffered a flesh wound to her right arm was said to be in good spirits on Saturday, while three other officers were taken to a hospital with stress-related problems. Following the shootout,  Moynihan was forced to undergo tests to check for bleeding in his brain, Evans said. 'We are hoping and praying there's not further damage,' he said on Saturday. He added that the officers had been watching the vehicle before pulling it over. Police are now interviewing the other two people in the car. It is unknown whether criminal charges will be filed. Thankful: 'I\u2019m thankful to the doctors and medical team at Boston Medical Center for taking such good care of my officer,' Commissioner William Evans (pictured demonstrating the suspect's hand movements) said . Police: Evans added: 'I was happy to hear that he made it through surgery without any complications, it shows you what a strong kid he is and what a great medical team they have here at Boston Medical Center' Officers conferred in Roxbury after Humboldt Avenue was shut down following a shooting on Friday evening . Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran who was awarded a medal for bravery by President Barack Obama last May for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. He had helped to save transit officer Richard Donohue Jr,  during the gunfight with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which occurred just days after the marathon bombings that killed three. He and other officers pressed against Donohue's chest and forced air into his lungs after he started losing bloody rapidly on the Watertown Street, ultimately saving his life, CNN\u00a0reported. Moynihan, an Iraq veteran, won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014. Local prosecutors will now investigate Friday's shooting to ensure that Moynihan followed departmental procedures during the attack, said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Connolly. Shootout: During the attack, the suspect, from Hyde Park, reportedly fired so many bullets that he emptied his revolver, according to the Boston Globe . He was later revealed to have had a violent criminal past . Crime scene: Moynihan was awarded a medal for bravery by President Barack Obama last May for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. Above, shots of the scene on Friday night . A helicopter flies over the scene after police shut down Humboldt Avenue following the sudden shooting . 'It's going to be completely transparent,' Connolly said of the review, which he added would be shared with West's family and lawyers once it is complete. Over the past year the United States has seen waves of sometimes violent protests after unarmed black men were killed by white police officers, including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. Evans alluded to those concerns, but stressed that West set off Friday's gunfight. 'It was a really violent confrontation that was clearly unprovoked by our officers,' the commissioner said. Such shootings are rare in Boston, but firearms are a major concern in the city, Evans added.

'We've got way too many guns out there, way too many young kids running around with the guns,' he said. 'Unfortunately, this is what happens.' Mayor Marty Walsh said his thoughts and prayers were with Moynihan, his family and other police officers in the department, saying: 'These acts of violence have no place in our neighborhoods.' He added: 'Our community is stronger than ever, and tonight we are thankful for all of those who put their lives on the on the line every day to protect our city.' An investigation is ongoing.",

        "article": "A one-year-old boy has died after a pick-up truck thought to belong to one of his relatives reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on top of him. The baby, believed to be from an Asian family, suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham. Several neighbours have said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. An air ambulance landed in a public park opposite the house and paramedics made desperate efforts to save the baby after the 'tragic' crash earlier today. Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident in Birmingham where a one-year-old boy died after a\u00a0pick-up truck -thought to belong to his father - reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on him . The boy suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham . Police were alerted  at around 5pm and officers said the road was likely to be closed for some time for an investigation to take place. The family's next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, said: 'The pick up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the home owner. 'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed. 'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams. 'There was blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.' One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I don't know how he managed to do it or whether the lad was in a pushchair or cot,' she said. A white forensic tent was erected outside the \u00a3120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place . Several neighbours said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. Dozens of flowers were left at the scene outside the home today . One young girl and her mother leave a bunch of flowers at the scene, where the crumbled wall remains today . 'But I'm certain he must have been on the footpath the other side of their garden wall. I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.' A white forensic tent was erected outside the \u00a3120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place and a large number of people could be inside one of the nearby homes. Neighbour Barbara Porter, 76, said: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere. 'Its a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heartbreaking. 'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame. 'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.' Another neighbour\u00a0Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring. 'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved. 'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy. Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save the baby and\u00a0Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene . Officers were called to the Stechford area of the city at around 5pm today following a report that a recovery truck had hit a wall, pictured is the road where the incident took place . 'I'm a grandmother and when you think it could have been one of your grandkids, you just can't imagine what the parents must be feeling.' Inspector Paul Bennett said: 'This is a very tragic set of circumstances \u2013 words cannot describe what his family are going through and our thoughts are with them at this time. 'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and \u2013 as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.' Dozens of people  have already taken to social media to send messages of support to the baby's family, who are believed to be from the area. Louise Pernell said: 'How terribly sad...thoughts go out to the family and those that attended the accident ...RIP little one.' Brad Wilkinson said: 'Tragic, thoughts are with the family.' Ben Weatherstone said: 'Just down the road from me... Horrible news.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'A rapid response vehicle was on scene within four minutes of the call and was backed up by an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a BASICS Emergency Doctor and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance. 'The boy suffered a serious head injury. 'Ambulance staff carried out advanced life support but sadly nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene by the doctor.' Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward, . Anyone with information about what happened should call police on 101 and ask for the Collision Investigation Unit quoting log 1637 16/3/2015.",

        "article": "A treasure trove of rare silver coins and jewellery that date from the reign of Alexander the Great have been discovered by cave explorers in northern Israel. The 2,300 year old treasures were found hidden in a narrow niche among pieces of broken pottery within the stalactite filled cave. They were spotted by three members of the Israeli Caving Club who had squeezed through the narrow passages at the entrance of the cave to explore inside. Scroll down for video . Silver coins dating from the time of Alexander the Great were found along side bracelets, rings and stone weights (all shown in the picture above) in a cave in northern Israel by members of the Israeli Caving Club . One of the spelunkers, Hen Zakai, spotted something shining on the cave floor. It turned out to be two ancient silver coins. Alongside the coins, the cave divers found a cloth pouch containing a handful of coins, rings, bracelets and earrings all made from silver and bronze. There may be dozens of treasure troves waiting to be uncovered around the world, according to a recent map. From the missing Irish Crown Jewels taken in 1907 to lost Faberg\u00e9 Eggs and looted 16th century Peruvian gold, designers have plotted their rumoured locations on an interactive map. In addition to the real riches, the map also features the location of mythical and fictional treasure in books and films. There are seven Faberg\u00e9 Eggs thought to be missing including the Royal Danish egg, made in 1903, and the Alexander III Commemorative egg produced in 1909. Their estimated value is $210 million (\u00a3137 million). Another missing treasure is the Amber Room panels, which were originally installed in\u00a0Charlottenburg Palace. It is rumoured to have been stolen by the Nazis and remains hidden in Konigsberg, Germany. Elsewhere, in 1901 the SS Islander sank after hitting an iceberg off the coast of Alaska. It is thought to have contained $250 million (\u00a3163 million) worth of gold. Among the mythical treasure on the map is a stash of $300 million (\u00a3196 million) buried by Benito \u2018Bloody Sword\u2019 Bonito on the Cocos Island in Australia. Archaeologists who visited the cave at the weekend say the coins were minted at the beginning of the Hellenistic Period during the reign of Alexander the Great. They believe they may have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the unrest that broke out following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. It comes just a month after a chest filled with gold coins was discovered by divers off the coast of Caesarea, near Tel Aviv, Israel. Speaking about the latest discovery, a spokesman for the Israel Antiquities Authority said: 'The valuables might have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the period of governmental unrest stemming from the death of Alexander, a time when the Wars of the Diadochi broke out in Israel between Alexander\u2019s heirs following his death. 'Presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days, but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it.' Mr Zakai had been exploring the cave, the exact location of which is being kept secret, with his father Reuven and their friend Lior Halony two weeks ago. The group had spent several hours exploring the narrow passages in the cave when Hen forced his way into a narrow niche and spotted the coins glinting in the light of his head torch. They reported the discovery to the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery at the IAA. Officials and archaeologists then returned to the cave last weekend and found considerable evidence that the caves had been inhabited by humans. The coins were found in a cave in northern Israel alongside the agate gemstones and oil lamp pictured above . One of the coins found in the cave is pictured above and is thought to have been hidden by refugees during an ancient war following the death of Alexander the Great. The coin above features Zeus sitting with arm raised . Numerous pottery vessels were discovered in the cave and some had been there so long they had merged with the many stalactites that filled the cave. Archaeologists say some of the artifacts found in the cave date back to the Chalcolithic period more than 6,000 years ago. Some bronze items date back 5,000 years while there are others from the Biblical period 3,000 years ago and the Hellenistic period 2,300 years ago. On one side of  the coins is an image of Alexander the Great, while on the other side is an image of Zeus sitting on his throne, arm raised as if ready to wield his fearsome lightning bolts. Among the other items discovered were agate gemstones and an oil lamp. The Agate stones found in the cave, shown above alongside a Hellenstic oil lamp, were part of a bead necklace . Some of the coins discovered showed the image of Alexander the Great on one side (as shown above) while the other showed the image of Zeus sitting on his throne, which helped archaeologists date the treasure . The silver coins, rings and bracelets (shown above) are the first of their kind to be found from the period of Alexander the Great's rule over Israel, according to archaeologists who have examined the discovery . Archaeologists believe there may be more items to be found within the cave and intend to explore it further. Amir Ganor, director of the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery commended the three members of the caving club for contacting the authorities about their discovery. In February the Israel Antiquities Authority announced that divers had found a chest filled with 2,000 gold coins dating back more than 1,000 years on the sea bed of the ancient harbour of Caesarea. Archaeologists say the coins, one of which is shown above, were crucial to dating the treasure discovered . The discovery comes just a month after divers found 2,000 gold coins (shown above) off the coast of Caesarea . The latest treasure trove was found in a cave in northern Israel while a previous discovery of 2,000 gold coins were found on the sea floor of the ancient harbour in Caesarea, just north of Tel Aviv and south of Haifa . He said: 'They understood the importance of the archaeological discovery and exhibited exemplary civic behavior by immediately bringing these impressive archaeological finds to the attention of the IAA. 'After the gold treasure from Caesarea, this is the second time in the past month that citizens have reported significant archaeological finds and we welcome this important trend. 'Thanks to these citizens\u2019 awareness, researchers at the Israel Antiquities Authority will be able to expand the existing archaeological knowledge about the development of society and culture in the Land of Israel in antiquity.' A silver ring containing a crystal accumulation, shown above, was also among the items found in the cave .",

        "article": "(CNN)A Pennsylvania State University fraternity has been suspended after allegedly posting on a private Facebook page compromising photos of women, including some who appeared to be asleep or passed out. The suspension of Kappa Delta Rho (KDR) fraternity comes as State College Police as well as university officials investigate the fraternity's alleged use of the online page with up to 144 active members, including current and former students. \"No arrests are being made at this time,\" State College Police Lt. Keith Robb said. \"Unfortunately, we aren't able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on Facebook were sanitized, wiped clean.\" Robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred. In a statement, college administrators said the fraternity's local chapter had been suspended for one year by the Penn State Interfraternity Council and that police and university officials were investigating. The statement said the fraternity used the private Facebook page to post \"highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at Penn State.\" The images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose, others appeared incapacitated. \"The evidence offered by the Facebook postings is appalling, offensive and inconsistent with the University community's values and expectations,\" the statement said. Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho's national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated. The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said. \"It ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a re-evaluation of the fraternity system is required,\" he said. \"Some members of the University senior leadership believe it is, and we are considering our options.\" David Clohessy, director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university's handling of sex crime reports. \"For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who'd listen that the university's problematic culture about sex crimes had been 'reformed,\" Clohessy said. \"The latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on Facebook, some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims.\" In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a  30- to 60-year prison term. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is appealing. \"The Kappa Delta Rho is a wake-up call,\" Clohessy said. \"But the Sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too.\" A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page, telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of \"unsuspecting victims, drug sales and hazing,\" according to a copy of a police affidavit. The drugs allegedly included \"marijuana and edibles, concentrates, ADD medication, and some cocaine,\" the affidavit said. The former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second Facebook page called \"2.0\" allegedly had been created around April 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it, the affidavit said. The earlier version of the page was titled \"Covert Business Transactions.\" Rape, nude photos, racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly? The ex-frat member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in, the affidavit said. The affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges, including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used. In the Sandusky case, the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by Sandusky -- either groped in a car, soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed. The scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and Penn State's vaunted football program, including the dismissal of the late legendary coach Joe Paterno and one of America's highest-paid university presidents, Graham Spanier. It also tarnished Penn State's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics. \"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students,\" said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations. Attempts to reach the university and interfraternity council were unsuccessful. CNN's Laura Ly and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Rap music and Muslim women... they are not four words that usually come together. But two women from London are breaking down the boundaries for Islamic females across the world with their brand of inspirational hip hop. Together, Muneera Williams, 34, and Sukina Owen-Douglas, 33, form Poetic Pilgrimage - a self-described 'hiphop hijabis' duo that has created a new type of rap music for the masses that addresses religion, gender and issues of identity. Scroll down for video . Muneera Williams, 34, (left) and Sukina Owen-Douglas, 33, (right) form the hip hop group Poetic Pilgrimage . The women, who were both born and raised in Bristol to Jamaican migrant parents first entered the hip hop world after they moved to the capital together to study at the University Of London a decade ago. Since then, they have cultivated a global fan base of devoted followers from both inside and outside the Islamic community. The attraction for their followers is, in part, the unlikely partnership between the fact that they are Muslim women who have an impressive ability to write and perform verse. Sukina and Muneera converted to Islam ten years ago, just three weeks before the 7/7 bombings, and while the path hasn't always been easy, they haven't looked back. They met at school in Bristol and first became friends while performing in a gospel choir, but only decided to form a group after moving to the capital to study at university. A few years later, they decided to convert to Islam after learning about the religion through the Autobiography of Malcolm X and academic books about Islam and Feminism. Muneera  and Sukina formed their rap group ten years ago . Like most other female Muslims, they now pray five times a day, avoid alcohol and wear the hijab. The marriage of their religion and their profession has both inspired and upset many people though. Sukina told FEMAIL: 'There are people who have messaged us from all over the world who are appreciative of the bravery in our character. 'But on the flip-side there are people who have been unappreciative from both the Muslim community and the non-Muslim community. 'People who have suggested were using our hijabs as a gimmick to make money and that we aren't Muslim at all. 'Then there are people who are really derogatory. In the opening lines of the Al Jazeera documentary we did recently, I rapped about being taken from Africa as a slave to the Caribbean in the opening scene. 'I got comments like \"You should be grateful that we colonised you, otherwise Africans would still be in mud huts.\" 'It's the nature of our technological society though, you get a lot of trolling.' The duo's lyrics are based around feminism, Islam and political issues . To say that the woman have cornered a niche in the market is an understatement - their lyrics are based around feminism, Islam and political issues. Sukina said: 'We talk about political situations but we try and take a different stance. 'For instance, with something like the Palestine issue we talk about someone who has lost a husband or someone who is a mother. 'So we talk about it from a female perspective.' At first, the women had a difficult time convincing the Muslim community that they should be onstage rapping. But in the last ten years, they have turned the prejudice around. Sukina said: 'In the Muslim community it was very difficult because the topic of hip hop is very flammable. It's everything that can be wrong with the world \u00a0- drugs, violence and everything. 'Parts of the Muslim community do find it very difficult. 'People have approached my husband and asked \"why do you allow your wife to do this? Why do you allow your wife onstage? I would never let my wife go onstage, I would never let my wife travel without me.\" 'He's a rapper as well, he's in a band called Native Sun and he has always known me as a rapper, so for us there has never been even a consideration that this shouldn't happen. 'But that is hard for people to understand. 'But in the last few years people have come to understand that it is a very positive thing and we have been asked to speak on panels at conferences on Islam.' The pair have released an album called The Starwomen . While there may have been problems with the way the women have been received, the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive overall. One of the biggest surprises for the women was how wide their fan base was when they started. Sukina said: 'When we first converted to Islam we though tour main following would be young Muslim girls from England. 'But at that time it was the beginning of Myspace - it was \u00a0the first independent platform to put your music online - and some comments we got from people blew our minds. 'We had amazing comments from people like a middle aged white guy from Austria or a couple from Portugal. 'It wasn't just people from the Muslim community. 'It is hard to put it into a box, we represent the voice of women, the voice of black people and the voice of people from Islam.' And with a huge surge in interest into their music over the last few months, their popularity is only going to grow. Sukina said: 'Some of the reaction we've had from people is amazing \u00a0- we can't get our heads around the attention we've got. 'Ours is not a story of sorrow, we are not women wounded, rather we have found strength in what may seem strange to overs and we wouldn't have it any other way.'",

The 22-year-old, who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in New York, has received critical acclaim. But in an exclusive interview with The Scottish Mail on Sunday, she revealed she had still not plucked up the courage to capture the Eurythmics star on canvas. Scroll down for video . Tali, right, pictured with her Eurythmics singer mother, Annie Lennox, is preparing for her first art exhibition . She said: \u2018She is one of the only people I haven\u2019t painted. I haven\u2019t built myself up to it yet. \u2018I am such a perfectionist and I worry that it might not turn out as amazing as I would want it to. She is so important to me and I want it to be just right.\u2019 Last week the 22-year-old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online . She has painted her close friends, her sister, even her boyfriend, New York-based photographer Ian Jones: \u2018I like to paint people I know rather than strangers, as I have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means. \u2018I will paint my mum at some point. The last time I was with her we were talking about it. I am thinking I might do a series, in different situations, that capture different sides of her.\u2019 The youngest daughter of the Scottish singer and her second husband, Israeli film producer Uri Fruchtmann, Tali grew up in London\u2019s Notting Hill. Yet despite her high-profile parents, she describes her upbringing as \u2018sheltered\u2019, saying: \u2018People find it hard to believe, but my childhood was really quite normal. \u2018My mum has always been so modest and grounded and didn\u2019t really involve herself in the world of celebrity. First and foremost, despite being an incredibly successful singer, she was a parent. \u2018I never felt we were under a spotlight and we didn\u2019t have paparazzi trailing us all the time, which I am grateful for. \u2018I think because we didn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary we were left alone and that helped me growing up. I didn\u2019t really feel any different to anyone else.\u2019 It was only when Tali and her older sister Lola first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how f\u00eated their mother was. \u2018I remember, during her performances, seeing people crying in the crowd and I was like: \u201cWoah, they must really love her\u201d. Thousands of people would be singing along to her music \u2013 I think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was.\u2019 Tali would later go into modelling, starring in big budget campaigns for Burberry and Prada. Two years ago, she put her modelling career on hold to move to the US and become a professional portrait artist. But still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day: \u2018I love to talk to her about what I am doing. I don\u2019t always listen to other people\u2019s feedback on my art, but with my mum I do listen. \u2018We are really similar and we think in the same way. I am so lucky to have someone in my life who I am so so close to in that way and who really gets me. I never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work, even self-portraits that are quite raw. \u2018Both my parents have always supported me and encouraged me to do what I love.\u2019 Her self-portrait show, Layers of Life, opens next week at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York\u2019s trendy SoHo area. Tali has inherited her mother\u2019s love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy. Art Attack: Tali Lennox prepares for her first solo exhibition at the Catherine Ahnell gallery in Soho New York . Last week, she faced criticism that some of her self-portraits, which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse, were in \u2018very poor taste\u2019. Yesterday, speaking from her studio in New York, the young artist, whose mother actively campaigns for women\u2019s rights, explained that she wanted to shine a light on \u2018every trait of human nature\u2019. She said: \u2018It is so important that we do not hide away from important issues such as domestic abuse. We have to face up to it if we are going to stop it. \u2018There is far too much abuse in the world. My mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking. 'I know some people may find my work quite intense, but I want to make emotive art. I want to make people feel something and look inside themselves. I want to evoke compassion and discussion. \u2018In a world where everything is instant and accessible, and people put out fragments of themselves on social media, I search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are. I am not putting my work out thinking everyone has to like it. Art is in the eye of the beholder.\u2019 Tali has been drawing and painting for \u2018as long as I can remember\u2019. While she admits she loves to sing, and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home, her sketch book was always at her side. The model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age . Her \u2018unexpected\u2019 move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty. \u2018I had singing lessons at school but my parents were never pushy,\u2019 she said. \u2018I love singing and am not bad at it, but I don\u2019t think I have what it takes to make a career out of it. \u2018Art has always been my passion, since I was very young \u2013 it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting cannot be beaten. I have always painted people. When I was younger I used to like drawing pretty girls from magazines but as I got older, after I started modelling and was in a world obsessed with looks, I started to prefer more distorted faces which have more depth.\u2019 The 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full-time. \u2018I still do some modelling, but not as much as I used to,\u2019 she said. \u2018I want to work on something I created, whereas when you are modelling you are part of someone else\u2019s idea. \u2018In modelling, your one main ambition is to look after the way you look. It is not something I felt I could immerse myself in full-time \u2013 plus I like eating nice food too much.\u2019 She added: \u2018A part of modelling is great and fun, but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure. You can feel a bit insecure. Maybe in a way it is selfish, but I needed to find a better balance for me. Tali admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling . \u2018I had never planned to model. It was all quite bizarre how it happened and I was very young but it taught me so much about myself and I met some amazing people.\u2019 Tali hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a \u2018privileged\u2019 girl who likes to paint. She said: \u2018I am not in this for the fame, that is not important to me, but I would like people to see my paintings and realise how hard I work. I know I have had a very privileged life, but it is important to me I am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer. Sometimes you hear people questioning why the children of actors and singers don\u2019t just get \u201cnormal\u201d jobs. But when you grow up in an artistic environment, this is normal. \u2018I also think it is in your genes. People are pleasantly surprised when they see that I am not a clich\u00e9 and I take my work really seriously. I felt it was important for me to fly the nest and come to New York on my own and be self-sufficient.\u2019 But she has never felt she was in her mother\u2019s shadow. \u2018I am so proud of what she has done in her life. I am so grateful to have such an incredible, passionate, giving person in my life. I was talking to her the other day about all her humanitarian work. She just never stops and does everything with the best of intentions.\u2019 The singer plans to be at the opening of her daughter\u2019s exhibition. Tali said: \u2018She is my greatest inspiration and I am so glad she will be there. All those closest to me will be \u2013 which means a lot.\u2019 Tali revealed she has also been taking acting lessons, saying: \u2018I love acting. It is similar to painting as you use yourself as the tool and it is scary because it all comes from within. To be successful you have to give your everything to it \u2013 so I don\u2019t think I could commit enough time just now with my art \u2013 but I haven\u2019t ruled it out.\u2019 Wistfully, she adds: \u2018I can\u2019t see myself in a comedy. I like things that are honest and raw, so I think the best acting is method acting for me.\u2019 l The Layers of Life exhibition will be open for a month from March 19 at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York.",

'I always tell him technique is not enough, he needs to put in a certain type of performance. Youngsters are going to have peaks and troughs, as Alvaro Morata did, on their way to maturity.'",

        "article": "The Married at First Sight\u00a0star\u00a0who almost left her groom at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him once again rebuffs his attempts to get intimate when he leans in to kiss her on their wedding night. On tonight's episode of the FYI reality show, Ryan Ranellone, 29, from Long Island, New York, admits that he is worried that Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, is trying to put him in the 'friend zone' just hours after they said 'I do'. And just minutes later his fears become reality when the 30-year-old sales rep refuses to get intimate with her new husband once they settle into their honeymoon suite, admitting that he still feels like a stranger to her. 'I haven't had sex in two years so there is now way we are having sex tonight, so I hope that we can just be buddies,' she says in a sneak peak from the upcoming episode. Scroll down for video . Romantic gesture:\u00a0Ryan Ranellone happily carries his new wife\u00a0Jaclyn Methuen \u00a0on tonight's episode of Marriedat First Sight . Back off: Jaclyn says she needs time to get to know Ryan, but he is worried that she is putting him in the 'friend zone' only hours after they said 'I do' The clip shows Ryan romantically carrying Jaclyn across the threshold into their hotel room, just moments before he playfully tosses her on a rose-covered bed \u2013 but despite his attempts to try and win Jaclyn over with romantic gestures, she confesses she is still hung up on his looks. Jaclyn, who has been single for the past seven years, notes that she needs time to adjust to her life-changing decision to marry a total stranger. 'Right off the bat, I am not physically attracted to him,' she explains. 'I don't even know how to be somebody's girlfriend never mind somebody's wife, so I just want to have some time to get to know him.' But Ryan has no problem expressing how thrilled he is to have Jaclyn as his new wife. 'We really don't know each other, but the experts definitely did a good job. I am very attracted to my wife, so I am looking forward to enjoying the rest of the evening with her and getting to know each other,' he says. Grand gesture: Ryan romantically walks Jaclyn across the threshold on their wedding night . The newlyweds indulge in some champagne and they joke around as they toss rose petals in the air, but Ryan remains determined to try and get romantic with his wife, who hugged him instead of kissed him at the altar. 'It feels like two good friends goofing around. I can't say it is exactly what I expected on our wedding night,' he tells the camera. 'I don't want her putting me into that friend zone.' Ryan can be seen leaning in for a kiss, but it's unclear as to whether or not Jaclyn accepts. 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to take step back and I need a little space. I need time,' she tells the cameras at the end of the clip. On last Tuesday's episode of the reality series, Jaclyn was forced to smile throughout a cringe-worthy post-wedding photoshoot with her new husband as they held hands and cuddled close for their first pictures as newlyweds. Look of panic:\u00a0Jaclyn is caught off guard when Ryan leans in for a kiss . Drop off: Ryan playfully tosses Jaclyn on a bed of roses in their honeymoon suite . 'When I look back at those pictures I am going to see a girl [who] was very overwhelmed - disappointed. I wanted to get a guy that's tall, dark and handsome,' she revealed to the cameras. At their reception, Jaclyn's female friends reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she shouldn't expect love at first sight. During the season two premiere of Married at First Sight, it was unclear as to whether or Jaclyn was going to say 'I do' to Ryan, but the reality TV star later confirmed to Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on the Today show that she did indeed marry the groom whose physical appearance was giving her second thoughts. 'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' she said of her disappointment in Ryan. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' And while, it looks like she making more of an effort to get to know Ryan on tonight's episode of the show, he might be moving too fast for her taste.

A woman has been spared jail despite being caught with more than 600 indecent images of babies and children and pornographic images of animals when she was just 17. Amy Hickson, now 20, of  Alresford, Hampshire, pleaded guilty at Winchester Crown Court to 13 offences which involved many of the sick images being stored as a Powerpoint presentation. She had also made Google and Youtube searches for child abuse images, the court heard. Judge Susan Evans said: 'There are babies in these images, two-year-olds, three-year-olds, four and five-year-olds. They are not all young children, but there are some very young children so it does make it very serious indeed.' She added: 'Theses children are the victims and people do not know what happens to them. But I know for sure they suffer serious physical and emotional damage from what they suffer in these appalling pictures.' The offences are made up of eight charges of making indecent photos of a child, one charge of a pseudo image of a child and two counts of possessing prohibited images of children. Hickson also pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing 16 'extreme, disgusting or obscene' pornographic images involving animals - including dogs, being abused and tortured. She was sentenced to a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 200 hours community service and attend a women's group. She was also made subject of a sex offences prevention order for five years and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years - and pay \u00a3750 costs and a \u00a3100 victim surcharge. Dawn Hyland, prosecuting, said that the indecent images of children included 219 of category A seriousness, 185 at category B and 199 at category C. The prohibited images included 523 cartoon images portraying child abuse, Ms Hyland said. She explained that Hickson's computer was examined by the UK police in February 2013 after they were tipped off by the American authorities. Andrew Turton, defending, said that Hickson, who is unemployed, was 'naive and immature' for her age and that she had left her university course following the police investigation and now remains living at home with her parents. Speaking at Winchester Crown Court, above,\u00a0Andrew Turton, defending, said that Hickson, who is unemployed, was 'naive and immature' for her age . He said: 'It is unusual to have someone who is a child, who is a youth, being involved with this type of offending.' He also described how she had cut and paste some of the images and added text in a 'childish' way - and the offences were committed using a computer which had been bought for her sixth form studies. He added: 'There is no suggestion that Amy Hickson is a danger to anybody - and certainly not a danger to animals, babies or children.'",

        "article": "A political group pushing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for the Democratic presidential nomination is trying to rally people around making her husband the . country's 'first lady.' Bill Clinton occupied the oval office from 2001 to 2009, and the idea of the famous political lothario being called America's 'first gentleman' has made the late-night comedy rounds already. But the 'Bill for First Lady' political action committee is for real, releasing videos, sponsoring social media accounts and hosting . events that feature a walking bobble-head mask . of the former president \u00a0\u2013 complete with  a red dress and high heels. BUBBA, PART DEUX: Hillary Clinton supporters are pushing online ads and personal appearances by a 'first lady' Bill Clinton as a PR stunt urging the former secretary of state to run for the White House . AVERT YOUR EYES: 'Bill' trades his Barbara Bush-style red dress and high heels for a star-spangled bikini in one video, suggesting how he might appear during campaign stops in South Carolina . The independent group plans to take the live-action comic character to the . early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa in support of . Hillary, though she has yet to formally announce her campaign. 'They always said Hillary wore the pants. Now I'm wearing the dress,' the character says in an Arkansas drawl in one online video. 'Put Hillary in the White House. I am homesick.' Another ad features young girls reciting a laundry list of feminist issues Hillary Clinton supports, while encouraging her to get into the race. 'As president, Hillary's experience will impress,' the say, 'but as first lady, Bill will rock the dress.' The ads were developed by Luke Montgomery, the creative force behind a highly controversial 'Potty-Mouth Princesses' video campaign. Americans have never seen a man in the role of 'first lady,' which is a ceremonial title associated with entertaining and promoting social issues. Many are confused about what to even call a husband put into the . traditionally female job. The Bill character's outfit is reminiscent of former First . Lady Barbara Bush's look: a boxy red sheath and shrug, . coordinating heels, blue handbag and belt, and a pearl bracelet. In photos taken at Miami Beach, he swaps the Capitol Hill attire . for a stars-and-stripes string bikini. Hillary's love of trousers led her to jokingly call . her supporters the 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits' during her first presidential campaign in 2008. It's her . husband who is infamously associated with dresses \u2013 . specifically a blue Gap frock worn by former White House Intern . Monica Lewinsky. 'There's more va-voom in a red dress,' the committee's . campaign manager Luke Montgomery told Reuters about its choice of colors. SHADES OF 'CREEPY UNCLE SAM': The conservative group Generation Opportunity made waves last year with an ad campaign encouraging young Americans to opt out of Obamacare, featuring a giant Uncle Sam character with a disturbing grin . President Clinton recently kidded with television host . Rachel Ray about the confusion over a husband taking the first-lady role, suggesting he might be the 'first man,' or 'I could . be called Adam.' Whatever his title, Clinton will have a tough act to follow . in the sartorial realm if his wife is elected. Current first lady Michelle Obama has planted her flag in the American . fashion world, wearing dresses from top U.S. designers and igniting . crazes for wide belts and the J. Crew brand. The 'Bill for First Lady' campaign aims to collect 100,000 online 'signatures' urging Mrs. Clinton to run. As of 6:00 p.m. Thursday, however, its total was barely 7,000.",

        "article": "A major Republican donor said Thursday he had heard an anti-Semitic remark made by Missouri GOP chairman against the state auditor who later killed himself believing he was being targeted for his religion. David Humphreys released a signed affidavit saying state GOP chairman John Hancock mentioned November 24, when he was still a party consultant, that Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich was Jewish. 'The meaning I took from Mr. Hancock's statement and tone of his comments was clear: He (Tom Schweich) is Jewish \u2014 in case you didn't know \u2014 and that being Jewish is a negative attribute for Tom Schweich's gubernatorial race,' Humphreys affirmed in the affidavit. Auditor Tom Schweich (left) committed suicide believing himself to be target of anti-Semitic smear campaign, which a top Republican donor said Missouri GOP chairman John Hancock (right) joined in on . Humphreys is the first person to publicly attest to hearing such comments from Hancock. Hancock said Thursday that he had met with Humpheys at the businessman's Joplin office to discuss Republican Party fundraising efforts, but he denied saying anything about Schweich's religion. 'It didn't happen,' Hancock said. Paul Mouton, a Republican Party insider who is acquainted with both Hancock and Humphreys, said he also was at the Nov. 24 meeting. His recollection backs up Hancock's account. 'I did not hear him say anything about Tom Schweich being Jewish,' Mouton told the AP. Schweich fatally shot himself February 26 at his home in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton, just a month after declaring his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. The shooting occurred minutes after Schweich told an Associated Press reporter that he was ready to go public with allegations that Hancock had made anti-Semitic remarks about him. Schweich had Jewish ancestry but attended an Episcopal church. Affirmed: David Humphreys, CEO of building products company Tamko, says he heard Hancock make a remark about Schweich's background that implied a negative view of his Jewish roots . Former US Senator John Danforth, an Episcopal minister who was Schweich's friend and political mentor, delivered the eulogy at Schweich's funeral. He suggested his friend had been driven to suicide by political bullying and an anti-Semitic whispering campaign. Danforth said Thursday that he asked Humphreys to come forward with his account, because Hancock has denied making such remarks. He said the Republican State Committee should oust Hancock from the chairmanship. 'The brand of the Republican Party in Missouri has been badly damaged, and it's very important to set the record clear,' Danforth said. 'I think it's important for Republicans to dissociate themselves from what has happened in the campaign against Tom Schweich.' Hancock has said previously that he had mistakenly believed Schweich was Jewish and, although he had no specific recollection of doing so, has said it's possible he might have mentioned that in an off-handed way while talking to prospective donors. Hancock said he learned the truth about Schweich's religion during a pair of conversations November 14 with Danforth and Schweich, and he said he certainly never mentioned Schweich was Jewish after that. 'I did meet with David Humphreys on November 24,' as Hancock was running for GOP chairman, he said. But 'I would not have said Tom Schweich was Jewish at that meeting, because I knew that he wasn't at that point.' Hancock said he also met with Humphreys on September 12, as he was raising money for a Catholic voter registration effort. He said it's possible he may have mentioned Schweich was Jewish during that meeting but he has no recollection of doing so. Hancock said he has no plans to step down as party chairman, a post to which he was elected on Feb. 21 while pledging to improve the party's fundraising. Humphreys, who had given generously to Schweich and various Republican causes, said he has no intention of giving money to Hancock for any reason. At the time of his death, Schweich was campaigning for governor against Republican Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House Speaker and US attorney. Hancock had done political research for Hanaway's campaign, but Hancock said his efforts were focused on the likely Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Chris Koster, not on Schweich.",

        "article": "A former NFL star and his new bride are calling it quits. Jennifer Conrad has filed papers to end her marriage to Keyshawn Johnson just seven months after she and the wide receiver said 'I do' in an intimate beachfront wedding ceremony. This also comes three months after one man claimed that Johnson was having an affair with his model wife. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Conrad has filed for divorce from former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (above) Johnson played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst . TMZ reports that Conrad claimed the pair separated back in February and is citing irreconcilable differences as the reason behind the split. She is asking for primary custody of the couple's two children, 5 and 2, and notes in the papers that she did sign a prenuptial agreement. Johnson and Conrad's wedding was a four-day celebration that spared no expense last August in Newport Beach, California, with the ceremony taking place at the swank\u00a0St. Regis hotel. Then, in December, a man came forward alleging Johnson had been having an affair with his wife. Brian Holloway sought an annulment after claiming his wife, Alicia Tarry, was having an affair with Johnson just six months after they were married. Holloway claimed he went through his wife's Twitter direct messages, and found numerous exchanges between her and Johnson, including a request for a graphic nude photo. 'Send me a p**** shot,' one direct message says. 'I'll get one in a few sorry have a guest over,' the other person responds. In December, Brian Holloway sought to annul his six-month marriage to model wife Alicia Tarry (above) saying she was having an affair with Johnson . Tarry says she did not have an affair with Johnson, and that these messages were 'illegally obtained.' Johnson seems to echo this statement, with a source saying he has 'no idea what the guy's talking about.' Johnson, who played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst and enjoy a very brief stint on Dancing With the Stars, is said to still be trying to repair his marriage with Conrad and get her back.",

The Reds legend turned pundit slammed the Dutchman for being 'really happy to be fourth' and criticised his style of play after Wednesday night's 1-0 win over Newcastle United. Asked if Van Gaal was setting his sights high enough, Scholes responded: 'No. He looks really happy to be fourth but this is a club that needs to be challenging to win the league. He's spent \u00a3150m. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal sits with assistant Ryan Giggs at Newcastle on Wednesday night . United legend Paul Scholes (left) has criticised Van Gaal's team after all their summer spending . 'They spent \u00a370m last year under David Moyes as well, that's \u00a3220m in 18 months and they look worse. 'He's not obsessed with possession but it is a very possession based game and what we've been used to over the years is not what are getting - and we probably won't get that. It's not great to watch but you have to say they are winning games. 'Not finishing fourth is not good, but to me not challenging for the league is not good enough. But we have to give him time. They can't keep on sacking managers.' Scholes, who was speaking on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, said United must be patient with the Dutchman but stressed that questions would have to be asked  if the club were not challenging for the title next season. 'Maybe the coach does need time to settle in too, but the one thing he has got is (Ryan Giggs, United\u2019s assistant manager) to help him settle and get him used to what to expect from Liverpool and from Newcastle,' he said. 'I can probably forgive him for this season - he's brought new players and they need time to settle in and so does he.

According to locals, Cherokee is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 300 native speakers left in the state. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the new division of New Kituwah Academy in January. The school has been operating since 2004 but up until now only taken students from early childhood through fifth grade. Continuing studies: A Native American language school for grades 6-12 will open in North Carolina in a bid to keep Cherokee culture alive - the New Kituwah Academy has only been open to young students up until now . From their earliest years, children learn only in Cherokee at the facility. Only in the higher grades is English introduced, mostly as a bow to parents concerned about what happens after their children leave the school. Cherokee had no writing system until the early 1800s, when the renowned silversmith Sequoyah wrote a syllabary to put its sounds on paper. While English has one symbol for every letter, Cherokee has one symbol for each of its 80-plus syllables. Unlike many other languages, which focus on nouns and adjectives, Cherokee focuses on verbs. One verb can reveal how many people are talking, what they're doing and how near they are. The near demise of the language came largely thanks to the U.S. government. Written words: This chart shows the Cherokee alphabet - there are now fewer than 300 native Cherokee speakers remaining in North Carolina . Learning process: Cherokee tribe member Haley Smith, 11, works on an English assignment at New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee . Most Cherokee were forced to make a brutal march from the Southeast to Oklahoma in the 1830s. A few stayed behind, keeping a desperate grip on their way of life. Then, beginning in the late 1800s, officials set up boarding schools to eradicate the American Indian languages. Teachers punished students for speaking their native tongues. Without New Kituwah or something like it, 'the Cherokee language will for sure die,' said Walt Wolfram, director of the North Carolina Language and Life Project at N.C. State University. 'Lots of people remain skeptical about whether languages can be revived. But the [other] option is certain death. In that sense, Kituwah Academy is the only antidote for what will be inevitable.' New Kituwah is one part of the Eastern Band's effort to preserve the language, said Annette Clapsaddle, director of the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, which has given almost $2 million to the school. Heritage: In this February 10, 2015 photo, a statue of Sequoya, creator of the Cherokee alphabet, stands in front of the New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee, North Carolina . Other initiatives include Cherokee language programs at public schools and a Cherokee studies program at Western Carolina University, she said. Throughout the U.S., Native American tribes in recent years have launched efforts to preserve their languages. The Cherokee nation in Oklahoma opened the Cherokee Immersion Charter School in 2002, said Julie Hubbard, a spokeswoman for Cherokees there. Students start at age three and go through eighth grade, when they can transfer to a public school or to Sequoyah High School, where the Cherokee immersion students study together, she said. New Kituwah - which has about 90 students - has had problems finding teachers fluent in Cherokee. Most native speakers are in their 60s and 70s and struggle with health issues, school administrators said.",

        "article": "The worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water, but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes. The TSA (Transport Security Administration) has its own Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing. From passengers travelling with their beloved eels, to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places, the TSA shares it all with its 238,000 followers. Though potentially harmless, this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals, the TSA says . Discovered in a carry-on bag at the Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado, it's hard to know what this odd-looking creature is. While it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy, TSA agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item. Grenades, whether inactive or otherwise, are prohibited in any carry-on or checked luggage. Another item to leave out of your hand luggage? Seal bombs, like those discovered in a passenger's carry-on bag in Seattle's Tacoma International Airport. A seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas, but, unfortunately, what this traveller didn't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry-on and checked baggage. Seal bombs, used for fishing, are prohibited from both carry-on and checked luggage . One of the oddest items that MailOnline came across while browsing the TSA Instagram was definitely a medieval mace, which was discovered in a carry-on bag at Chicago's Midway International Airport. Similarly dangerous, a pair of cat-shaped brass knuckles were seized at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. While they may look like a key chain at first glance, these feline-inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board. One of the strangest confiscated items? A medieval mace, found at Chicago's Midway International Airport . These cat-shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported . In 2012, officers seized a bag of live eels, which they found in a passenger's checked luggage in Miami . Officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012. Found in a passenger's checked bag at the Miami International Airport, the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to Maracaibo, Venezuela. However, instead of arguing with security, the passenger, smartly, opted to surrender all items to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Seven small snakes were also discovered in Miami in 2011, after being stuffed down a traveller's trousers in nylon stockings. The snakes were found using TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology, which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight. The passenger was later arrested and charged. And yet another animal-based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a Scooby Doo greeting card, despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry-on bags. A Scooby Doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife . Also in Miami in 2011, a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes, in nylon stockings, in their trousers . Swords, though fine to check, cannot be brought on board an airplane as a carry-on item . This Jack the Ripper-like sickle was seized from a passenger's bag because no blades are allowed on board . Throwing stars, which are used in martial arts, are banned in some American states but not others . Interestingly, one item travellers can bring through security: a freshly-baked pie, like this one . From swords and a Jack the Ripper-like sickle to throwing stars, all bladed objects are prohibited from carry-on bags - but that hasn't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint. But don't worry, even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase. Interestingly, however, you are allowed to bring baked goods through security, such as this pecan pie.",

        "article": "The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions. Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries. Ronaldo pictured following Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France at the 1998 World Cup final at the Stade de France . Ronaldo looks gutted after the loss as he was not himself in a final where the pressure seemed to get to him . France vs Brazil in the 1998 final led to a government investigation about Ronaldo's involvement . France: Barthez, Thuram, Desailly, Leboeuf, Lizarazu, Deschamps (c), Karembeu, Petit, Zidane, Djorkaeff, Guivarc'h . Goals: Zidane (27, 45+1), Petit (90+3) Booked: Deschamps, Karembeu, Desailly . Sent off: Desailly . France manager: Aime Jacquet . Brazil: Taffarel, Cafu, Aldair, Baiano, Carlos, Sampaio, Dunga (c), Rivaldo, Leonardo, Bebeto, Ronaldo . Goals: NONE . Booked: Baiano . Brazil manager: Mario Zagallo . Venue: Stade de France, Saint-Denis . Referee: Said Belqola . Attendance: 80,000 . Civil action in a Rio court, a Rio medical council action against two team medics (both of whom were unanimously absolved of blame) and an investigation in Brazil's national congress have shed some light on the events of  July 12 1998 but it continues to be a source of consternation in the country. The official records show the match ended in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil but the story of what happened in and around the Stade de France that afternoon is murkier in detail. Ronaldo, then just 21, had been outstanding all tournament in a Brazil side - including Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Bebeto - that were defending their title from 1994. The final was billed as a head-to-head between him and France's equally captivating talisman Zinedine Zidane. In the event, the France midfielder steamrollered a jaded Brazil outfit, scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with Emmanuel Petit adding a third after a late counter-attack. It was the first time France had been crowned world champions but it later transpired much of the drama had already happened, out of view of the many millions of TV viewers worldwide. The day had began in a relaxed fashion for the Brazil players. The whole squad had lunch at the Chateau de Grande Romaine, just outside Paris then returned to their rooms. Ronaldo was sharing with Roberto Carlos, neighbouring a room with Edmundo and Doriva. France's Zinedine Zidane sees his header go through the legs of Brazil's Roberto Carlos in the final .

France manager Aime Jacquet holds up the World Cup trophy and is surrounded by the world's media . Zidane was a worthy winner of the World Cup as he brushed aside Brazil with two goals in the final . Roberto Carlos implied Ronaldo was wilting under the weight of expectation of the nation. 'He was scared about what lay ahead,' he said, 'The pressure had got to him and he couldn't stop crying.' To government congress later, Edmundo described a viscerally shocking scene as suddenly Ronaldo started to have a fit. He frothed at the mouth and began to shake uncontrollably. Roberto Carlos, overwhelmed by panic, started screaming for help. 'When I saw what it was, I despaired,' said Edmundo, 'Because it was a really strong and shocking scene.' He ran through the hotel hitting on all the doors and shouting for everyone to come. A congressmen asked the striker for more details. 'Was Ronaldo hitting out or shaking?' 'Hitting out a lot,' replied Edmundo. 'Lying down?' 'Lying down and hitting himself with his hands like this, with his teeth...' 'Together?' 'Locked together and with his mouth foaming.' 'His whole body hitting itself?' 'The whole body, yes.' Defender Cesar Sampaio put his hand in Ronaldo's mouth to unravel his tongue and prevent him swallowing it. Ronaldo then fell asleep and, according to Edmundo, team doctors decided to pretend that nothing had happened when he woke up. Ronaldo had a fit before the World Cup final but was controversially allowed to play against France . Brazil supporters expected so much but were let down as their team were beaten 3-0 by a strong France side . The front page of French newspaper \u00a0L'Equipe ahead of France vs Brazil friendly on Thursday . Ronaldo woke up and went for tea. But he was subdued. Leonardo, one of the side's senior players at the time, insisted that Ronaldo be told what had happened and the doctors relented. At 6pm when the squad began the short coach journey to the Stade de France, Ronaldo went to the Lilas clinic in Paris. His name was left off the teamsheets, sending the assembled international press into frenzy but 40 minutes before kick-off he arrived after being given the all-clear and insisted he should play. Brazil's miserable showing on the pitch led to outrage in the country and rumours began to swirl about wrongdoing in the camp in the lead up to the match and even conspiracy. Manager Mario Zagallo was criticised for picking Ronaldo despite what had happened but he defended his decision. 'If you invert the situation and I didn't put Ronaldo on and then Brazil lost 3-0, people would say 'Zagallo is stubborn, he had to put him on, Ronaldo was the best player in the world.'\u00a0So I think I would do the same again. Now was it his being chosen that caused Brazil to lose? Absolutely not. I think it was the collective trauma, created by the atmosphere of what had happened.' Brazil manager Mario Zagallo (right) pictured after the 3-0 defeat by France in the capital Paris . Zagallo consoles Ronaldo after the final as the Brazil manager controversially allowed the striker to play . Understandably Ronaldo, who continued to play for Brazil until 2011, tried to downplay the affair throughout his career. Last year, in a TV interview with Gary Lineker as his country prepared to host the World Cup, he lifted the lid on what had happened. He told the story of the fit and revealed he begged the manager to let him play. 'I had a convulsion, after lunch in the afternoon. I was unconscious for three or four minutes. I don't know why. Nobody knows. Was it pressure or nerves? It could be,' he said, 'When you are there and you breathe the competition, everything is about the competition. You cannot disconnect from it. It's a lot of pressure. But I pleaded with Zagallo to let me play.'

Hunter rushed onto the court to embrace his son R.J., who had made two free throws with 21.6 seconds left, at the final buzzer in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament championship in New Orleans. Unfortunately for Hunter Sr. he managed to tear his Achilles as he jumped up and down hugging his son and eventually he had to be helped off the court. Georgia State coach Ron Hunter tore his Achilles after rushing on to the court to celebrate his team's 38-36 win over Georgia Southern in New Orleans on Sunday . 'I'm actually embarrassed by this because it takes away honestly from what these kids have done,' said Hunter . Hunter is helped off the court on Sunday after celebrating with his son TJ and tearing his tendon . 'To be honest with you, I saw the kid shoot the ball. I saw the red lights go off\u2026and I jumped up. I tore my Achilles' years ago on the right side playin' basketball when I was 26 years old,' Hunter told reporters afterwards, 'and it was the exact same feeling. I knew when I jumped up. 'I hadn't jumped that high probably in 26 years. I knew when I came down I had done it and instead of stopping right there, I wanted to go celebrate with my team and, more importantly, I wanted to go celebrate with my son.' Hunter Snr. later returned to the court on crutches and helped cut down the nets, which were lowered for him, reports the Washington Post. 'I'm actually embarrassed by this,' Hunter said, 'because it takes away honestly from what these kids have done.' The win clinched Georgia State's third appearance in the NCAA Tournament and first since 2001.

        "article": "Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality glasses start-up, has provided a rare glimpse into the capabilities of its technology. The company, who received $542 million (\u00a3352 million) in funding by Google, today released a video that showcases its augmented reality graphics in a real-life setting. Titled 'Just another day in the office of Magic Leap', the clip shows an office worker scrolling down his email inbox, which appears in front of him as a hologram. Scroll down for video . Titled 'Just another day in the office of Magic Leap', the clip shows an office worker scrolling down his email inbox, which appears in from of him as a hologram . The Magic Leap user then opens up a series of holographic folders in front of him using hand gestures. After clicking on a video game icon, a game automatically loads and the user is placed in a virtual reality game setting instantly. He then picks up a real toy ray gun and uses it against an army of virtual reality invading robots. The video ends with the logos of Magic Leap and Weta Workshop, the special effects team behind movies like 'Lord of the Rings'. He then opens up a series of holographic folders in front of him using hand gestures.After clicking on a video game icon, a game automatically loads and the user is placed in a virtual reality game setting instantly. The Florida-based company was meant to show at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, this week, but mysteriously cancelled its appearance. Its system is currently one of the most highly-anticipated, and secretive, virtual reality glasses in development. Last month, the company revealed some details about its augmented reality glasses - although it appears the technology still needs a full trolley of parts to work. The 3D system operates by shining images on the retina, creating an augmented reality which combines fictional characters with the real world. The Magic Leap user then picks up a toy ray gun and uses it against an army of virtual reality invading robots . The Florida-based company was meant to show at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, this week, but mysteriously cancelled its appearance. Its system is currently one of the most highly-anticipated, and secretive, virtual reality glasses in development. Pictured is a scene from the video . Until now, very few details about the Florida-based technology had been revealed. \u00a0Rachel Metz, writing for MIT Technology Review, was able to test out one of the larger systems. The patent shows that, in terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles . Rachel Metz, writing for MIT Technology Review, was able to test out one of the larger systems which will compete with the likes of Facebook's Oculus Rift and Microsoft's HoloLens. 'Magic Leap had to come up with an alternative to stereoscopic 3-D \u2013 something that doesn't disrupt the way you normally see things,' she wrote. 'As I see crisply rendered images of monsters, robots, and cadaver heads in Magic Leap's offices, I can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they're actually sitting in my living room while, on their end, I appear to be sitting in theirs. 'Or walking around New York City with a virtual tour guide, the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past.' Magic Leap's Florida-based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, which it calls 'cinematic reality'. The firm's website features an elephant (pictured) moving  realistically in a person's hands . Sensors can track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select and back . She says the experience is like 'watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me, letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds.' In October, Magic Leap announced it had raised $542 million in funding, led by Google. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack. It connects to a network, which then connects to a so-called 'passable world model.' This model is created using a database of objects and 'object recognisers'. Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. In one drawing from the patent, a mother and child are in a supermarket, and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley. Other drawings show a man watching sport on this TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him. The company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket. But the prototype that Ms Meltz used was fixed on 'unwieldy scaffolding'. The company won't say how it will shrink its device, but chief executive Rony Abovitz has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses-like system. Despite the secrecy surrounding the system, it has been deemed exciting enough for Google to have invested around $500 million. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. In January, an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work, it also provides a number of example uses. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. It features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look, functionality and uses for the device. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack.

Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible, with the correct depth and proportions. Further into the patent, a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings. One shows a man watching sport on TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him . An example image, showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology, is pictured.\u00a0As part of Google's investment, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at the search engine, will join Magic Leap's board . Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. Mr Abovitz recently said: 'We have the term 'cinematic reality' because we are disassociated with those things. 'When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. 'To go farther and deeper than we're going, you would be changing what it means to be human.' The soon-to-be defunct Google Glass, already lets users see augmented reality. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The Magic Leap patent shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists, for example. Google Glass also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer's vision. Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus last year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers. Unlike Magic Leap's future device, it blocks out the real world around the user. Gamers hope Facebook and Google's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences. A release date and price for the Magic Leap headset have not been revealed. Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was bought last year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched . While it is not clear exactly what form the technology will take, it could be added to future versions of smart glasses (Google Glass pictured). A release date and price for the headset have not been revealed .",

        "article": "Freddy Ovett describes himself as \u201850-50\u2019 British and Australian, though the soft Queensland accent seems a giveaway. It isn\u2019t quite as simple as that, because Freddy is the son of Steve, 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport, whose rivalry with Sebastian Coe captivated a global audience. Three decades on, Freddy is forging his own path \u2014 but as a cyclist, not a runner, having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with Chris Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, and recently signed with France\u2019s top development team. Cyclist Freddy Ovett is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father Steve Ovett . Ovett Jnr spent his first seven years in Dumfriesshire, where his parents moved after Steve\u2019s retirement, and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 \u2014 by coincidence, the year Freddy was born. Freddy knows little about his father\u2019s brief cycling career, and laughs as he says: \u2018I can imagine him rocking up, thinking he was stronger than anyone.\u2019 But he knows everything about his running: \u2018My depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad\u2019s. I have to correct him sometimes on what he did and didn\u2019t do.\u2019 Freddy and his father Steve hit the running track, somewhere Steve is very familiar with . Father and son are cut from the same cloth. \u2018We\u2019re so, so close, and so similar,\u2019 he says. That augurs well for Freddy and badly for opponents, since the older Ovett, now 59, was famously competitive. He was equally famously prickly with the press \u2014 a trait that doesn\u2019t seem to have been inherited by the genial, open Ovett Jnr. Had social media existed in the 1980s, it\u2019s difficult to imagine Steve asking a journalist to publish his Twitter handle (it\u2019s @freddyovett, since you ask). Freddy\u00a0recently signed with France\u2019s top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike . Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner, just like his dad, and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon. Then he suffered a knee injury. \u2018It was so frustrating. I came back to Australia and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape,\u2019 he says. Tests at the Victorian Institute of Sport suggested he had promise. \u2018I think I was meant to be a cyclist all along,\u2019 Freddy says. \u2018I always followed it, I was always staying up to stupid hours watching the Tour de France. It fascinated me, despite the scandals. I was a big fan of Lance Armstrong before the whole downfall.\u2019 MEDALS: 800m Olympic gold, 1500m bronze (1980); 1500m European gold (1978); 800m European silver (1974, 1978); 5,000m Commonwealth gold (1986). WORLD RECORDS . Ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat Seb Coe\u2019s record . Battled with Coe for the mile record in 1981 \u2014 it changed hands three times in nine days . Set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 . Set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years . Ovett was also BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1978 . What did his father make of him turning his back on running? \u2018When I started cycling, we weren\u2019t speaking,\u2019 says Freddy. \u2018It was a strange time, it lasted about a year, which was tough on both of us.\u2019 His parents are divorced and while his mother is still in Noosa, Queensland, his father lives down in Melbourne with his new partner. \u2018When I went to Europe last year, my dad and I got back in contact,\u2019 Freddy continues. \u2018He sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through. \u2018He\u2019s super supportive about my cycling \u2014 and excited more than anything. When I speak to him I can sense that.\u2019 Freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father Steve . One of the challenges in athletics, says Ovett Jnr, is dealing with doping, which \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one. \u2018Cycling has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out,\u2019 he claims. \u2018In athletics, a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of, because they\u2019re not knowledgeable enough.\u2019 Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R. They are as French as cycling teams come, but manager, Vincent Lavenu, a top rider in the 1980s, was interested in a rider called Ovett. \u2018He was a fan of my dad\u2019s,\u2019 says Freddy. Steve Cram and Ovett during the heats of the Men's 1500 metres event at the Summer Olympics in 1984 . He shares an apartment with a French rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner. The team is paying for French classes \u2014 he goes to school for three hours a day. The question of his nationality is unresolved. Enquiries were made about him riding for Scotland at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, but he is undecided. \u2018I have dual citizenship. I don\u2019t want to rush anything,\u2019 he explains. He is wary of declaring for Britain or Australia when he feels he hasn\u2019t proved himself deserving of a place in either national team. Steve was a 1980 Olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of British sport . \u2018I need to learn in Under 23 racing before trying to be a hero,\u2019 he says. \u2018But I\u2019m definitely not opposed to representing the UK.\u2019 What does his dad think? \u2018I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s good at letting me feel my own way. He\u2019s trying to not put too much pressure on me. Both (British and Australian) set-ups are really good \u2014 both have incredibly strong national teams.\u2019 Last year, during his first racing trip to Europe, Ovett stayed with his agent, Baden Cooke, in Monaco, which is also where Froome and his Sky team-mate Richie Porte live. Freddy, 21, is based in Chambery in the Alps, in an apartment owned by his new team, AG2R . \u2018It was fantastic,\u2019 says Ovett. \u2018I went on quite a few rides with Richie and got on really well with him \u2014 he checks up on me. And I rode with Chris, including one ride where he was training for the Vuelta. I learned so much. \u2018He is such a nice guy and I read a bit about him \u2014 he is like this African Maasai warrior, extremely talented but he couldn\u2019t get a handle on how to race. \u2018I don\u2019t compare myself with him but I can relate to that. I feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills, but I know I\u2019ve got so much to learn.\u2019 Freddy was a promising middle-distance runner and in 2012 won a scholarship to the University of Oregon .",

        "article": "Motorists face a new speed camera blitz and \u00a3100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of Britain\u2019s busiest roads . Motorists face a new speed camera blitz and \u00a3100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of Britain\u2019s busiest roads. Until now, lower speed limits have been restricted to smaller roads in residential areas or near schools. But in a major policy shift, 20mph limits are to be introduced on major arterial roads \u2013 and policed by the latest digital speed cameras. Campaigners say it is the start of a radical new nationwide attempt to slow traffic down. London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday revealed that eight pilot schemes will be run on \u2018Red Routes\u2019 \u2013 the main arterial roads that carry a third of the capital\u2019s traffic. Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and many other towns and cities say they also intend to introduce the new limits. Motorists caught breaking the 20mph limit face a minimum \u00a3100 fine and three points on their driving licence. The AA says the new limits are being driven more by \u2018dogma\u2019 than road safety. A spokesman said: \u2018These 20mph zones are popping up like spring daffodils. \u2018There is a lot of fear among drivers that, with 20mph being a relatively unfamiliar speed, widespread speed camera use will make them look more at their speedometers than at what is happening on populated streets in front of them.\u2019 If the 18-month trials in London are judged a success, the 20mph limits will be made permanent and imposed on 30 miles of key \u2018Red Routes\u2019 considered by transport bosses to be \u2018more local road than motorway\u2019. Some 175 miles of residential streets, about a quarter of the capital\u2019s roads, already have 20mph limits. The trend is spreading across Britain. Following a pilot scheme, Bristol has spent more than \u00a32.3million installing 20mph signs. Manchester is consulting on half the city being similarly covered, and 6,000 Edinburgh residents have signed a petition against a \u00a32.2million scheme to make up to 80 per cent of the Scottish capital a 20mph zone. Alec James, of Sustrans \u2013 a charity campaigning for healthier and cheaper transport \u2013 said of the London announcement: \u2018This is a significant step up \u2013 and the next step on the road for more 20mph limits. Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured, wants to introduce new 20mph speed limits across the city . Upper Street in Islington, pictured, is also going to be hit by a 20mph limit as part of the 18-month trial . \u2018It\u2019s pioneering. For the first time 20mph limits are being imposed on main arterial roads \u2013 not just quiet residential roads where there is little traffic. We expect other cities to follow London\u2019s lead.\u2019 But the AA says while 20mph limits have their place, they should not be introduced where they will increase traffic jams and pollution \u2013 and where residents want them, not imposed in a \u2018blanket\u2019 fashion. A blanket rollout of 20mph zones in towns and cities will result in millions of pounds in fines pouring into Treasury coffers, the AA warned last night. Motorists caught on speed cameras going over 20mph will be fined a minimum of \u00a3100, and get three points on their licence. The money goes to the Treasury. Until 2007, Safety Camera Partnerships kept all the cash they raised from fines, often using it to buy more cameras to generate more money. This led to motorists complaining that the cameras were being used as \u2018cash cow\u2019 revenue-raisers. To defuse the controversy, the system was scrapped and all fines are paid directly to the Treasury, which in turn returns the cash as a general road safety grant to pay for cameras and \u2018other measures\u2019. The AA says it does not oppose 20mph limits where appropriate and where they are supported by residents, but it fears many councils and campaign groups are being driven by \u2018an inherent or institutional prejudice against the motor car\u2019. A spokesman said: \u2018The blanket rollout of so many 20mph limits and zones is going to push lots of money into Treasury coffers and give them a cash windfall. Worried drivers may feel well and truly fleeced if they are caught on camera and fined for being marginally over the speed limit.\u2019 Other councils which have implemented or are committed to adopting new 20mph limits include Portsmouth, Oxford, Bristol, Newcastle, Warrington, Sheffield, York, Middlesbrough, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Brighton & Hove, Leicester, Cambridge, Coventry, Bath & North East Somerset, Darlington, Wigan, Rochdale, Shipley, Bury, Bolton, Nottingham, Calderdale, together with numerous London boroughs. Under the new London scheme, the first road to convert to 20mph next month will be Commercial Street in Shoreditch, linking into plans for Tower Hamlets and Hackney to become 20mph boroughs. Transport for London said: \u2018Safety cameras across London are being upgraded to new digital cameras which will have the capability to help police enforce 20mph speed limits\u2019, adding that it hoped the new limits will reduce the number of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2020. Rod King, founder of the \u201820\u2019s Plenty for Us\u2019 campaign group, said: \u2018The current 30mph national limit is being rejected as \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d for communities so we\u2019re setting out a series of government actions required for a planned transition to a UK default urban limit of 20mph by 2020.\u2019 A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u2018Research shows 20mph zones can save lives and this government has made it easier for councils to introduce them. \u2018It is for local authorities to set speed limits and for the police to decide how best to enforce them.\u2019 The spokesman added: \u2018We are undertaking a three-year research project to better understand the effect of 20mph zones and their impact on local communities.\u2019 r.massey@dailymail.co.uk .",

        "article": "A political operative has sued presidential campaign adviser David Axelrod over Axelrod's claim that he came up with the attack strategy that saved an embattled Philadelphia mayor in 2003. Philadelphia campaign consultant Frank Keel said it was his idea to blame Republicans for an FBI listening device found in Democratic Mayor John Street's office. Keel considers the decision to attack then-President George W. Bush's Republican administration 'a defining moment' of his career, according to his lawsuit. 'His brazen and successful handling of the crisis launched Keel to the forefront of his profession,' said the legal filing, filed earlier this week and first reported on by\u00a0The Philadelphia Inquirer. In his book 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics,' Axelrod takes credit for the plan to accuse President George W. Bush's Justice Department of trying to sink Street's re-election bid. David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign strategist in 2012, is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir . WHOSE IDEA WAS IT? Philadelphia Mayor John Street (right) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame Republicans for alistening device the FBI planted in his office . The FBI bugged Street's office as part of a 'pay-to-play' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer, a top Street fundraiser and 10 others. The mayor himself was never charged and denied wrongdoing. Street had initially been quiet about the bug found in his City Hall office but went on the attack as the campaign claimed that Republicans did it. Weeks later, he won re-election in a landslide. Axelrod, in a statement, said his book does not rule out the possibility that other advisers 'arrived at the same conclusion or proceeded on parallel tracks.' But the lawsuit claims Axelrod was unreachable on the day Keel came up with the strategy \u2013 and later opposed it. Shawn Fordham, Mayor Street's 2003 campaign manager, submitted a statement with the suit saying that Axelrod eventually 'got on board' and called Keel a 'hero.' Keel also sued Penguin Random House, Axelrod's publisher. It dismissed Keel's claims as 'utterly absurd.' Axelrod served as President Barack Obama's chief campaign strategist in 2008 and 2012. Now the founding director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, Axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the Chicago Tribune. Three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting U.S. Senator Paul Simon. Mitt Romney's personal assistant Garrett Jackson (right) saw and heard everything the GOP candidate said and did during the last presidential race, and he said Axelrod lied about the 2012 Election Night concession call to make the Republican look like a race-obsessed sore loser . In addition to the Street campaign, Axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, He later worked for then-Senator John Edwards' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to Obama's 2008 effort. Ultimately he became one of the president's most senior advisers before departing the White House in 2011. His career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in Canada and Italy. 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics' came out in mid-February and has already brought complaints from two people who say Axelrod lied in the memoir . This year he's consulting with Britain's Labour Party in advance of May 7 elections. Labour has said Axelrod is being paid a 'six-figure salary' for his advice, and that he is working with Douglas Alexander, Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary \u2013 largely via telephone conference calls. The Street case is the second claim that he lied in his memoir. The personal aide of one-time Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blasted him last month for writing that Romney had claimed President Barack Obama's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation tageting blacks. Garrett Jackson told CBS News that Axelrod told a 'ridiculous ... lie' about a phone call between Obama and Romney on Election Night. The Republican nominee, according to Axelrod's account, angered Obama when he called to concede the race \u2013 saying,\u00a0'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' That's how Obama remembers it, Axelrod wrote. 'In other words, black people,' his book records the president as saying, 'That's what he (Romney) thinks this was all about.' Garrett claimed he was in the room listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and it never happened. Separately, Axelrod made news in February with a speech at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics by claiming that the Obama presidency has seen 'six years in which there hasn\u2019t been a major scandal.' That claim drew a mix of applause and laughter from his audience.",
        "highlights": "Axelrod took credit in his memoir for a plan blaming GOP dirty-tricksters for a listening device the FBI planted in a Philadelphia mayor's office as part of a criminal probe .\nBut another Democratic operative claims it was all his idea \u2013 and Axelrod thought it was a bad one .\nIt's the second time the Obama confidant's book has been branded dishonest .\nA Mitt Romney aide said last month that Axelrod lied when he wrote that the Republican candidate suggested on Election Night 2012 that Obama only won because his outreach targeted black voters .\nAxelrod has a long career in Democratic politics and landed a six-figure consulting contract with Britain's Labour Party during this year's elections .",

        "article": "Thomas Aiken may not be defending his title, but South African players will look to maintain their stranglehold on the Africa Open in East London this week. England's Andy Sullivan is favourite to spoil their plans after winning the Joburg Open last Sunday, the 27-year-old claiming his second European Tour title in South Africa in the space of eight weeks. But home players have won the event every year since it began in 2010, with former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel winning the inaugural event and being followed into the winners' circle by fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen (twice), Darren Fichardt and Aiken. Andy Sullivan  in action during the pro-am ahead of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke hits an approach shot in practice ahead of the tournament . Aiken's win 12 months ago helped him top the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit and secure a place in the field for the WGC-Cadillac Championship, which is also being staged this week at Doral. That leaves the likes of Fichardt and George Coetzee to lead the home challenge, with Coetzee keen to keep the trophy in South African hands. 'It was my first time playing (in 2010) and it was a big deal to see all the foreign players pull into East London,' said Coetzee, who finished 24th in the defence of his Joburg Open last week. 'Since then the Africa Open always attracts a strong contingent of local and international players. The crowds are always fantastic, because they are lively but very neutral. They just want to watch some great golf and they cheer for everyone. It's fun to play in front of galleries like that. 'Personally, I would very much like to put my name below Thomas' on the trophy before the international players have their day.' Matthew Baldwin of England tees off on the fifth hole  during practice at the stunning East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke is a notable name in the field but it is Sullivan, however, who looks most likely to gatecrash the home party. 'I think if I did I'd become one of the most hated people down here, so I'm not sure if I want to win this week,' Sullivan joked. 'But obviously it would be great to get a victory down here as well. 'It's quite hard because we go from week to week so it still has not sunk in yet. I am on the crest of a wave and just want to keep riding it and hopefully keep going this week. I'm looking forward to the task at hand, I think the wind is going to keep the scoring pretty fair and it should be fun. A buck crosses the fairway as home player Trevor Fisher jnr plays a shot . Thankfully for Graeme Storm the bucks stop with him able to hit his drive during the pro-am . 'It's a hell of a lot different to last week where we were just hitting the ball straight up in the air, it could be a massive change to what we are used to but I've had a couple of days in the wind now to get used to it and a feel for the course. We are professional golfers for a reason, we should be able to adapt.' Four of the players who finished runner-up to Sullivan last week - David Howell, Jaco van Zyl, Wallie Coetsee and Kevin Phelan - are in the field at East London, along with Oliver Fisher, who lost out in a play-off to Aiken 12 months ago. 'I have fond memories of the place, it was a good week last year and hopefully I can have a good week again,' Fisher said. 'Last year I started well here to set the season off on a good tone and it's always nice to get off to a good start.'",

He started by buying several cars, as well as customizing them for clients across the world, and in 2001 he founded the London Motor Museum. Today is has nearly 250 automobiles. \"When I was modeling, the best part of my modeling career was (that) I was expressing what my client wanted me to do,\" he says. \"I still express what (clients) want me to express, but this time in a three-dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels. And that is ultimate satisfaction.\" During his fashion model days, Elo owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week. What started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time, and after a while Elo felt that he came to a crossroads. \"I had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars. So I chose the latter,\" he says. \"My friends told me 'You're absolutely crazy, look at all these beautiful women, look at all this traveling around the world.' And I'm like 'Are you out of your mind? Look at that beautiful steel!' That's the best.\" Today, the car-lover's  collection includes gems such as the 1937 Lincoln Zephyr, and a low-riding customized Cadillac which used to belong to Snoop Dogg -- the so-called \"Snoop de Ville\". But what gives Elo the most satisfaction is something less material: the feeling of freedom. \"When I drive a car, I feel like I am leaving all my worries behind, and it's just staying behind whilst I'm going forward,\" he says.",

        "article": "Irbil, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, even uniting Sunni and Shiite fighters in the mission. The Iraqi army, along with Sunni and Shiite militiamen, attacked ISIS strongholds in the area Monday, the state-run Iraqiya TV reported. Iraqi warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around Tikrit. It's part of a wide-scale offensive ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group's capture of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. Tikrit is best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria. Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour. The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared. What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout. Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. While Iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area, it has generally been under ISIS control for the last eight months or so. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the Shia al-Hashed al-Shaabi militia, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades, and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he will \"oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit\" from ISIS. In short, this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to ISIS last summer after a string of dramatic defeats. Last June, Tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by ISIS militants. They captured more than a thousand Iraqi soldiers, who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by U.S. forces. ISIS subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers, and posted the video of the killing online. There is concern that Iraqi forces, eager for revenge, may kill combatants and civilians alike. The U.N.'s envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, urged all armed forces in Tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians. U.S. and other coalition troops have been conducting a crash course to retrain and upgrade the Iraqi army, and several thousand Iraqi troops have passed through the course. This offensive will tell whether that training has made a difference. The offensive also highlights the role played by neighboring Iran in the fight against ISIS. The semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency reports that Qassim Sulaimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Al-Quds Brigade, is helping oversee the operation to retake Tikrit. Iran has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. If the offensive succeeds, it means that retaking Mosul, a city 10 times bigger, is possible. But Tikrit is almost 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Mosul, and much of the territory in between is under ISIS control. Al-Abadi has said the immediate goal is to liberate Salah ad-Din province, of which Tikrit is the capital, and then focus on adjacent Al-Anbar province, a similarly Sunni-dominated province. After that, retaking Mosul is an option. If, however, the Tikrit offensive fails, it could spell disaster for Baghdad. There will be political recriminations, the already fragile morale of the Iraqi army could collapse, the Kurdish autonomous region could decide to break from Iraq, and it would provide ISIS with a victory it hasn't seen since last summer. Ben Wedeman reported from Irbil, and Mariano Castillo reported from Atlanta. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Holly Yan, Kareem Khadder, Hamdi Alkhshali and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",

        "article": "We all know we should be eating the recommended \u2018five a day\u2019 of fruit and veg. Now there\u2019s a host of exotic superfruits that are said to help reverse the skin\u2019s ageing process, boost energy levels and even fight disease. MANGOSTEEN . Native to South-East Asia, mangosteen is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019, because Queen Victoria offered a reward to anyone who could deliver some to her palace. Perhaps she\u2019d heard about its amazing health benefits, which range from healthy joints to improving the immune system. Mangosteen (pictured) is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019 and is native to South-East Asia . \u2018Mangosteen has been touted for its high content of xanthone compounds, which studies have shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties,\u2019 says Naomi Mead, lead nutritionist and founder of nutrition clinic Food First. Mangosteen is also good for acne, PMS and younger-looking skin. Buy your mangosteen in liquid form from Holland & Barrett (\u00a32.45) or Planet Organic (\u00a32.75), or order a bottle of capsules from biovea.com (\u00a317.20). PITAYA . More commonly known as dragon fruit, this is mild- tasting, but packs a powerful nutritional punch. Pitaya (pictured) is more commonly known as dragon fruit and although it's mild-tasting it has high nutritional values . \u2018Pitaya is rich in vitamin C, which has been repeatedly proven to protect against auto-immune diseases, heart problems and even the signs of ageing skin. It contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and improve cell function,\u2019 says Mead. Ocado stocks it in fresh (\u00a32.99) and tea (\u00a32.99) form. GAC . The spiky outer layer of this vine fruit might be poisonous, but the edible arils, or extra seeds, hidden inside are used across South-East Asia because of their fantastic red colour. Gac fruit (pictured) has a spikey outer layer which might be poisonous but the extra seeds inside are edible . The fruit contains huge amounts of beta-carotene and lycopene, known for their medicinal properties. \u2018Research has found the concentration of lycopene in gac to be around ten times higher than in tomatoes and carrots,\u2019 says Mead. \u2018Several studies, including research from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at Portsmouth University, suggest lycopene helps protect against cancer of the lung, stomach and prostate.\u2019 Order gac, in powder form, for the princely sum of \u00a366.57 from Amazon. No one said every superfood comes cheap. SAW PALMETTO . The berries of this plant have been used in American Indian herbal medicine for hundreds of years \u2014 and for good reason. The fruit contains antioxidant compounds that can help in the treatment of an enlarged prostate gland or benign prostate hyperplasia. \u2018Clinical research has shown that taking one 320mg capsule of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery reduces blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital,\u2019 says Mead. Capsules available from Holland & Barrett (\u00a312.25) or Amazon (\u00a37.99). LUCUMA . \u2018Not only is it a good source of antioxidants, fibre, beta- carotene, niacin, potassium, zinc and iron, but the caramel taste makes it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics and those avoiding refined sugar,\u2019 says Mead. Pick up this yellow Peruvian fruit at Planet Organic (\u00a36.99) or Whole Foods Market (\u00a37.42). PICHUBERRY . Another Peruvian export, this small berry  looks similar to a kumquat, but has a much higher vitamin content. Not only does it boast excellent levels of vitamin D, vital for healthy bones and skin, but it also contains vitamins C and B12. \u2018It has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as possessing anti-cancer properties,\u2019 says Mead. Pichuberry (pictured) is a Peruvian export and looks similar to a\u00a0kumquat but has a much higher vitamin content . Also known as Inca berries, green-fingered experts say they\u2019re hardy enough to be grown in Britain. Find them at biovea.net/uk (\u00a313.05) or suttons.co.uk (\u00a32.49 for seeds). ARONIA . All hail this North American berry, which has one of the highest antioxidant values recorded for a fruit. The deep purple berries, often called chokeberries due to their tart taste, are packed full of natural compounds that help protect cells from free radicals that cause ageing, degenerative diseases and cancer. Buy from Ocado (\u00a34.55 for juice), biovea.com (\u00a312 for capsules) or Whole Foods Market (\u00a318.29 for 1kg of berries). MONK . \u2018In its purest form, this Chinese fruit is 300 times sweeter than table sugar, but is all natural and has a low glycaemic index, which means it is absorbed very slowly, making it suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemic individuals,\u2019 says Mead. Fans of monk call it the \u2018longevity fruit\u2019 as they believe it increases life expectancy. Studies suggest it helps to support the immune system, digestive tract and acts as a natural antihistamine. You can order it from Amazon for \u00a311.99.",

        "article": "Wales manager Chris Coleman has noticed no difference in Gareth Bale's mood ahead of his side's huge Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel and believes the Real Madrid superstar is ready to perform. Bale has had to endure a rough ride in Spain of late, with his worth to Real being questioned by both fans and the powerful Madrid media. The world's most expensive player has been booed by his own supporters and had his car attacked outside the club's training ground following last weekend's Clasico defeat to bitter rivals Barcelona. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . But Coleman insists Bale remains relaxed around the Wales camp and the thought of him having a conversation with the forward about his club situation has not even entered his head. 'I cannot see any difference in Baley at all,' Coleman said on the eve of Group B's top two sides meeting in Haifa on Saturday night. 'If I thought it was bothering him, and we're all human beings so I know it can bother you from time to time and you can get a bit down, and it was a problem then I would have sat down with him and had that conversation. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . Real Madrid star Gareth Bale , who has received harsh criticism in recent weeks, appears relaxed in training . 'But we have not mentioned Real Madrid, we have only talked about Wales, Israel and the job in hand. 'He is happy, relaxed and more importantly he is fit and ready to play.' Bale has been singled out for some rough treatment in the group so far, most noticeably from Cyprus last October, and the 25-year-old could be a marked man again on a night where a hostile atmosphere is expected as group leaders Israel defend their unblemished record against second-placed Wales. Israel coach Eli Guttman insists his side do not have players 'strong enough to kick Bale out of the game' but Coleman remains philosophical about the treatment his star man could receive at the Sammy Ofer Stadium. Aaron Ramsey (left) and Bale (right) watch on as Wales defender James Collins holds possession . 'We cannot come back without anything,' Coleman said. 'That is not the stage we are at. We know what we are up against and they will know that about us. 'Their game against Belgium on Tuesday will not exist for them, they are only thinking about us and that is not our business. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . 'It is up to Israel to do what they want to do,' Coleman said. 'Israel have to do what they have to do to get a result, as do we. But the attention is nothing new for Gareth. 'He has played most of his football in the Premier League and that is the most physically demanding league in the world. 'I've also watched him out in Spain come through the Madrid derbies and the Clasico and we know all the focus will be on him. 'But we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness. 'We are not here because of one player. Gareth is a huge help, but he is part of something that has been growing.' The Real Madrid star stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday afternoon . Wales remain unbeaten after four games but are one point behind Israel, who play their match in hand at home to group favourites Belgium on Tuesday. Coleman has described the Haifa showdown as Wales' biggest match since the Euro 2004 play-off defeat to Russia, and admits that failing to make the finals in France in two years' time would hurt everyone connected with Welsh football. 'I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it, qualified for a major tournament,' Coleman said. 'I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. We have a good current group and we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. 'One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. 'But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go and I'm not being arrogant when I say it's about us and not anyone else.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Samuel Eto'o wanted to buy a watch. It was in London that he decided to purchase one particular model, one which cost $15,000. For a former Premier League footballer, a hero in his native Cameroon, and one of the most successful African footballers of all time, the prospect of buying a watch was hardly the most daring of ordeals. So after taking a glance at the watch and getting out his credit card, he says he asked the sales assistant for some help. \"I asked the saleswoman -- who was also black like me -- 'Could you show me that watch please?' \"First, I saw her turn and look at her coworkers like, 'Uh, what should I do?' \"Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, 'OK, I'll buy it.' \"I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined. \"I asked her, 'Was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted?' because this has happened to me many times and she told me, 'No, it was declined.'\" Eto'o, who played in London with Chelsea last season, called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed. While Eto'o does speak English, his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier. \"My brother can afford this and the way you're treating him shows that you think just because he's black, he can't afford this watch,\" said the sibling. Eto'o then takes up the story, saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because \"we had some Nigerians in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards.\" \"If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all. Tomorrow, if a white man in Africa makes a mistake, we should judge all white people? No! \"The security guard from Senegal kept trying to justify what the lady said and I asked him where he's from. When he told me, I said, 'Ahh. If I gave you my name, you will recognize who I am?' \"He shrugged and I said, 'I'm Eto'o.' He went, 'Nooooo! Just yesterday, my wife and I were talking about you! Can I take a picture with you and send it to my wife?' \"I said, 'Yes, we can take a picture, but you made a mistake because you can't judge people by the color of their skin,' so he told me it wasn't because of our color. \"I told the lady, 'In my next interview, I'm going to tell them about this and I'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here,' added Eto'o referring to the saleswoman. \"She then realized that I could have reported what she had just done, but it was a mistake. It was a mistake of her to categorize. \"I don't think she's a racist person, but she stereotyped all black people as 'those people'.\" Eto'o tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football's problem but one that society as a whole must combat. The Cameroon international has played across the world in England, Italy, Spain as well as a spell in Russia with Anzhi Makhachkala. He says he has experienced racism on and off the field, most famously during his time playing for Barcelona. In 2006, during a game against Real Zaragoza, Eto'o was subjected to \"monkey chants\" -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch. He says it was only because of persuasion by his teammate Fran that he stayed on and helped his side to a 2-0 victory. In 2010, while playing for Inter Milan at Cagliari, Eto'o was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three-minute stoppage to the contest. The referee addressed both captains while a message was also broadcast inside the stadium warning supporters the game would be abandoned if the chanting did not stop. Eto'o went on to score the only goal of the game as Inter triumphed 1-0. \"You have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society,\" said Eto'o. \"It's not that football is here and society is here -- no, it's a reflection of what goes on in society. \"Football is a great opportunity for certain people, who sometimes think they're better than you or different than others, to express their views as right ... or as a chance to hurt other people. \"The first time I experienced racism wasn't on a football pitch, but the truth is that I never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion, it's a feeling that touches millions of people. \"Sometimes, the fact that you're a footballer makes you think that racism can't happen to you because you bring that passion and you express a lot of things. \"When it happened to me, I couldn't believe it and in that moment, I decided to walk off the pitch.\" Eto'o, now 34, believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums. In 2007, he said he did not want his kids having to watch him being booed and subjected to racist abuse. \"I said that back then because racist incidents almost seemed to be fashionable,\" Eto'o explains. \"When you arrive at a football ground, this is going to happen -- when there's a black player, this will happen. \"In that moment, I said, 'No, my kids aren't going to go and see that because it will be very difficult to explain.' \"If you tell a child, go to the right and you'll get a reward, he'll always go to the right because he wants the reward. A child comes to see his father play, have fun, make people happy and what does he see? \"He sees people booing his father for being black, they make monkey noises, they throw bananas at his teammates and all that. \"But we see more and more that authorities are fighting, people are increasingly against what happens in football grounds and in society is getting better.\" Eto'o was presented with the European Medal of Tolerance from the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation following a ceremony in London earlier this week. For a man who has won three European Champions League titles, his assertion that this particular award is his \"biggest\" gives an insight into Eto'o's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism. \"It's the most important,\" Eto'o said of the award. \"It's something that affects us all and to recognize the little work that I've done, the truth is that I'm very, very happy because you can win the Champions League, you can win championships, you can score goals, but to represent a fight that affects millions and millions of people ... it's one of a kind.\" Eto'o also defended Russia's record of dealing with racism, despite FIFA, the sport's world governing body, expressing its concerns over how the country's authorities deal with the problem. According to a report published earlier this month by the FARE network, an anti-racism body, and the Sova Center, which conducts research on nationalism and racism, there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the Russian game over two seasons. The fans of CSKA Moscow, one of Russia's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with UEFA, the game's European governing body, handing out punishments on numerous occasions. Yet, Eto'o, now playing in Italy with Sampdoria, retains fond memories of Russia. The four-time African Player of the Year joined Anzhi in 2011 following a deal which made him the highest paid player in the world on a reported salary of $13 million a year. He scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining Chelsea in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that Russia is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 World Cup. \"At the World Cup in Russia, you'll see that there won't be incidents like this,\" he added. \"I hope there aren't because I've played there and I had a great time there and I know the efforts that the Russians are making to try to improve certain things that have happened there, and we have to support these efforts. \"Football is beautiful. Football is beautiful because whether you win, draw or lose, you can go and shake your opponent's hand whether they're white or black or red or blue. \"This is football. This is where football wins, but when there are incidents like this, it's shameful, but it doesn't mean this will happen in the World Cup just because it's in Russia. \"I was there and I lived a beautiful experience.\"",

        "article": "When Sporting Lisbon forked out their biggest transfer fee of the season on an unknown Scottish teenager, you could have expected Ryan Gauld to feel the spotlight burning fiercely on him following his arrival in Portugal. The Scotland Under-21 international insists, however, that he feels under less pressure at his new club than he did at Dundee United. Gauld secured a dream \u00a33million move to Sporting from Tannadice last summer after long being tagged with his \u2018Mini Messi\u2019 nickname on these shores amid endless hype about his ability. The Portuguese giants have blooded him slowly into their side, giving the 19-year-old plenty of time to adjust to his new life. After playing in several League Cup ties, he was finally unleashed in a league game against Rio Ave in January. Sporting Lisbon's Ryan Gauld (centre) says he feels at home in Portugal after his move from Dundee United . And Gauld \u2014 who starred for Danny Lennon\u2019s Scotland Under-21s during their win in Hungary this week \u2014 admits he is delighted at the way he has settled into his new surroundings, highlighting the way he has been able to learn \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 as the reason for his successful transition. \u2018Of course there was a bit of pressure on me going to Portugal,\u2019 he says. \u2018But I was excited at the thought of a new beginning. \u2018There was a lot of focus on me in Scotland \u2014 a lot of talk about me and what I was going to do. Youngster Gould (right) is currently back in his home country with Scotland Under 21s . \u2018But I wanted to escape that. That\u2019s why I was delighted to sign for Sporting because it was like starting again. That was part of my thinking behind the move. To get away from it all and develop as a player behind the scenes. \u2018People might think the pressure would increase going to a bigger club in a bigger league. But for me it was almost the opposite. I can relax more at Sporting. I was delighted to get out of the limelight that I had at United. When I was there, there was so much talk about stuff I didn\u2019t like to read about or hear. \u2018So going over to Portugal was the right move for me, in terms of development. I knew I wouldn\u2019t go straight into the first team. It took Gauld a while to settle into his new surroundings, but now he feels at home in Lisbon . \u2018I was always going to have to play for the B team first but that was perfect for me to learn. There was no pressure on me. I could get on with it behind the scenes.\u2019 Gauld admits it wasn\u2019t all straightforward and that it took some time to settle into life in Lisbon. However, he believes he has finally adapted to both the change of football style and lifestyle and loved making his bow for Sporting, where he was widely praised by coming off the bench and inspiring a 4-2 win at home to Rio Ave. \u2018I\u2019m in a good place right now, definitely, in my football and in my life,\u2019 he continues. \u2018I\u2019m at a really good point in my career. I\u2019m playing games every week and I\u2019m enjoying it. I feel more settled in Lisbon now than I did six months ago. It was a big move and it was always going to take time to adapt. Gauld (left) played in an international challenge match for Scotland Under 21s against Hungary this week . \u2018If I\u2019m honest, it did take longer than I expected it to. But now I\u2019ve been there nine months and I feel totally at home in Portugal. \u2018That\u2019s my first year nearly up and it\u2019s flown by. I\u2019ve settled well and I\u2019m really happy. The main thing to begin with was adapting to the way the Portuguese play because it\u2019s very different to what I was used to. \u2018It took a lot of games for the B team before I felt comfortable with Portuguese football and the way they play. But I\u2019ve been rewarded by a couple of substitute appearances for the first team, so everything\u2019s going well right now. Gauld has long held the nickname 'Mini Messi' but he feels out of the spotlight playing for Sporting Lisbon . \u2018The night when I made my debut in the league was brilliant. It was against good opposition in Rio Ave. \u2018To get around 25 minutes and see the tempo the game was played at was a great experience. I was playing with top players. \u2018The crowd seemed to take to me. A big deal was made when I went over to sign, so the fans were eager to see what I could do. I think they were quite happy to finally see me in action. Hopefully I\u2019ve not disappointed them.\u2019 Gauld (second left) moved to Sporting Lisbon for \u00a33million from Dundee United (pictured) And while not quite completely fluent in Portuguese yet, Gauld has integrated well with the rest of the Sporting squad. \u2018I\u2019ve picked up a fair bit of the language recently,\u2019 he adds. \u2018I can now have conversations and stuff off the pitch. I\u2019m maturing as a person over here. Living in a different country by myself and not knowing the language has made me grow up. I\u2019ve matured a lot. \u2018I had to learn loads of things and do it on my own. It has made me come out of my shell because I was quite shy before I came. Gauld (right) stretches with Under 21 team-mate Billy King at St Mirren Park this week . \u2018There are a couple of Portuguese phrases that I\u2019ve heard the boys saying, so I tried to pick them up. But I can\u2019t seem to get a grip of them and they\u2019re giving me a hard time about it! \u2018It\u2019s not swear words, just slang saying like we\u2019d say in Scotland: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s just a casual phrase. I think I\u2019m saying it the exact same way as them but they tell me I get it wrong. Maybe it\u2019s my Scottish accent!\u2019 Gauld (front right) leads the way as Scotland Under 21s arrive at Glasgow Airport on Wednesday . The focus for Gauld now is to get more game time and figure more prominently in manager Marco Silva\u2019s plans. \u2018Between now and the end of the season, my aim has to be to be more involved in the first team,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve had a spell where I was in a lot of squads but now I\u2019m back in the B team. They want to dip me in and out. It\u2019s to make sure I continue to work hard and know what it takes to make the A team.\u2019",

O'Leary, who ended his eight-year stint as the talent show host on Friday, is believed to be in talks to take over the controls of The Getaway Car, a new road show in which members of the public compete in a series of driving challenges. The star, who already has a show on BBC Radio 2, could, according to a well-placed source, co-host the programme with The Stig, the stunt driver from the latest Top Gear series, whose identity is a secret. BBC bosses stressed last night that the new show was not a replacement for the Corporation's embattled Top Gear. Dermot O'Leary (pictured) is being lined up to take over the controls of a new BBC 1 motoring show . The future of that programme remains in doubt after the BBC decided not to renew presenter Jeremy Clarkson's contract following his attack on producer Oisin Tymon. The BBC is planning a pilot edition of The Getaway Car and has issued a casting call for potential contestants, who take part as a pair. The publicity states: 'Anything goes as long as you know each other pretty well and think you would make great TV.' The pilot, which will not be transmitted, will be filmed later this year in what has been described as a 'very glamorous' overseas location. A spokesman for O'Leary confirmed the star was in talks with the BBC but declined to comment further. She said: 'Dermot has spoken to the BBC about a project but I can't say more than that.' O'Leary may also be co-hosting the show with the Stig (pictured), whose identity is a secret . A spokesman for the BBC confirmed it was making a pilot for The Getaway Car but said no presenters were yet attached to the project. She said: 'This non-transmittable game show pilot is still in development and there are no presenters currently attached to it. We will not comment on speculation as to who they may be.' Meanwhile, the exact circumstances of O'Leary's departure from The X Factor appeared to be in some dispute last night. There was speculation that X Factor boss Simon Cowell had decided to drop O'Leary, 41, because of his interest in the rival BBC job and that he wanted to sack the presenter to avoid giving the impression that he was walking out on the ITV show. But senior X Factor sources played down that idea. One source on the show said: 'That is not a scenario I recognise.' A spokesman then added that it had been O'Leary's decision to leave the programme. ITV is expected to announce that Caroline Flack, 35, who was crowned winner of last year's Strictly Come Dancing TV show, will replace O'Leary and co-present The X Factor with singer Olly Murs, 30. A spokesman for ITV last night paid tribute to O'Leary's time on The X Factor. He said: 'We'd like to thank Dermot for eight brilliant years at the helm. He has been a fantastic host. We will miss him and his dance moves and wish him all the best for the future. An announcement on the host for the new series will be made in due course.'",

'I think, to be acknowledged by Dior is just, it means a lot as a woman to feel beautiful, and elegant, and timeless.' Last week, Dior's decision to cast the chart-topper as the newest face of its spring-inspired Secret Garden campaign, which is currently in its fourth year, was met with an overwhelming amount of support, both from the fashion industry, and from the label's fans. '#HistoRIH @rihanna is gonna be the first BLACK\u00a0WOMAN to be the face of Dior!!!!!' one person tweeted, while another added: 'Huge news for @rihanna today: she's the first black woman to be the face of Dior.' Dior confirmed that it had signed Rihanna up as its newest campaign star on Friday. According to\u00a0WWD.com, the French-based brand stated that Rihanna is set to feature in the fourth installment of the video and print series of the Secret Garden campaign, joining models such as Daria Strokus, Melissa Stasiuk and Xiao Wen Ju, all of whom have previously featured in the Secret Garden series. While further details about the campaign have not yet been released, the fashion label confirmed that film and print versions, shot by photographer Steven Klein, 'are scheduled to run this spring'. Big deal: While discussing her soon-to-be-released animated movie Home, Rihanna explained how important she believes her new Dior campaign will be for 'a lot of young girls of any color' Anticipation: The chart-topper added that she was thrilled just to be 'recognized' by the iconic French fashion label . The announcement was made just days after the popstar was spotted filming in the ornate surroundings of the Palace of Versailles in Paris, France, where all of Dior's previous Secret Garden campaigns have been shot. Rihanna was seen strolling through the Palace's luxurious rooms during the late night shoot, while wearing a glamorous sequin gown - and a pair of fluffy slippers. Her thick hair was styled in luxurious waves, swept back off her face to allow her features to shine, while a bold dark lipstick spiced up the look. Rihanna posed among a hallway of gold statues as cameras flashed away. Earlier that day, the star was also seen enjoying some downtime in her trailer, which was located at the Palace. Rihanna was pictured lying down, while having her nails done by an assistant. Strike a pose: Rihanna was seen working on a photoshoot for the upcoming campaign at the Palace of Versailles on Tuesday night . Couture: The popstar was modeling a beautifully-cut black Dior gown and red leather gloves . Just a few days later, Rihanna was back at work on another night shoot at the Palace, this time posing up a storm in the estate's impressive grounds while wearing a beautifully-tailored black gown. The sleeveless dress featured a striking white leather waist belt which of course simply highlighted the singer's slim frame. Adding her own signature style to the ensemble, Rihanna decided to pull down the zip featured down the front of the frock, which revealed a hint of side boob. This new campaign will mark Rihanna's debut as a model for the brand - however she is known to be a great fan of the brand, and is often seen wearing a variety of Dior's latest and greatest designs while frequently featuring on the front row at the label's Paris Fashion Week catwalk shows. And while Rihanna has not previously modeled for Dior, the star does boast plenty of fashion experience, having previously modeled for the likes of Balmain and Emporio Armani, as well as appearing on numerous covers of fashion bible Vogue. She joins the likes of Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and French beauty Marion Cotillard, all of whom have starred in campaigns for Dior in the past. Laidback style: Last week, the 27-year-old chart-topper was seen on a late-night shoot at the Palace of Versailles (pictured), where all of Dior's previous Secret Garden campaigns have been filmed .

The last installment of the Secret Garden campaign, which debuted in May 2014, has had more than nine million views on YouTube. It was also shot at the iconic French palace. Making clear the key role that the historical setting plays within the campaign, Dior said of its previous video installment: 'As the eyes open upon the famed perspective of the chateau gardens and their massive geometries, as on the cusp of a dream, the Dior woman draws the spectator with her around the twists and turns of a secret and amazing Versailles.' Known also as the Chateau de Versailles, the extravagant royal residence is located just southwest of Paris. Three French kings lived there, including Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV, up until the French revolution in 1789. Each king increased the palace\u2019s splendour by continuing to build upon the premises.",

        "article": "A former member of the Islamic State today claimed he witnessed the British graduate dubbed Jihadi John behead a Japanese hostage. The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer:\u00a0Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. He later featured in a video with Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.",

        "article": "(CNN)Here are some of the names you might be hearing about as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev goes on trial in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings: . \u2022 Dzhokhar \"Jahar\" Tsarnaev: Born July 22, 1993, Tsarnaev and his family immigrated to the United States and applied for political asylum when he was 8. A popular student, Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and was captain of his high school wrestling team. He received a $2,500 scholarship from the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and attended the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Tsarnaev was known on campus for selling marijuana, according to court testimony. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2012, seven months before the bombings. Federal agents say surveillance video captured him near the second blast site, where 8-year-old Martin Richards was killed. After the bombings, Tsarnaev returned to campus and stayed there until the FBI publicly identified him as a suspect. Tsarnaev texted a friend to come to his room and take whatever he wanted as he would not be coming back. He and older brother Tamerlan went on the run, allegedly killing an MIT officer, carjacking an SUV and engaging Watertown, Massachusetts, police in a firefight. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed, and Dzhokhar was discovered the next day, badly wounded, hiding in a boat. \u2022 Tamerlan Tsarnaev: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, born October 21, 1986, was an accomplished boxer. He won the New England Golden Gloves heavyweight division in 2009-2010. Known for his flashy clothes and in-your-face self-confidence, Tamerlan aspired to join the U.S. boxing team despite being only a permanent resident and therefore ineligible. In early 2011, Russia asked the FBI to look at Tsarnaev's activities. After interviewing Tsarnaev and family members, the FBI said it \"did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government.\" In January 2012, Tsarnaev left New York for Russia. It's not clear what he did while there, but Tsarnaev's father has said his son was with him at all times. He returned to the United States in July 2012. Seventy-two hours before the bombing, he was seen working out at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts gym with his younger brother. He was killed following a gunfight with Watertown police after his brother tried to free him with a stolen SUV but ran him down instead, according to an indictment against the younger Tsarnaev. \u2022 Anzor Tsarnaev: Anzor Tsarnaev is the father of the Tsarnaev brothers. Originally from Chechnya, the family was exiled by Russians and settled in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan before seeking political asylum in the United States. The elder Tsarnaev fixed cars for a living, making ends meet through welfare. He and wife Zubeidat divorced in 2011, and he returned to the Russian republic of Dagestan, where he now lives. \u2022 Zubeidat Tsarnaeva: Mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva worked as a home health aide before switching to facials and skin care, both at a local spa and in her Cambridge home. She was charged with shoplifting in summer 2012 and soon after moved to Dagestan. If she returns to the United States, she could be arrested for failing to resolve the shoplifting charges. She has phoned several times during her younger son's incarceration. \u2022 Ailina Tsarnaeva: Ailina Tsarnaeva is the sister of the Tsarnaev brothers. At age 16, she entered an arranged marriage that produced a son and lasted little more than a year, according to an investigative piece by The Boston Globe. Last year, Tsarnaeva was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment, accused of making a bomb threat against the mother of her boyfriend's child. She denies the charge. Her last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey, near her sister and the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. \u2022 Bella Tsarnaeva: Sister Bella Tsarnaev also reportedly has a child from a failed marriage, according to The Boston Globe. She was arrested in New Jersey on marijuana charges, and she entered into a pretrial intervention program. \u2022 Katherine Russell: Raised as a Christian in Providence, Rhode Island, \"Katie,\" as she was known in high school, went to Suffolk University in Boston but dropped out before graduating. She married Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2010 in a small, private ceremony officiated by a Boston imam. She worked as a home health aide to support the couple's young daughter. Her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of Ailina and Bella Tsarnaeva, her sisters-in-law. By all indications, Russell has chosen to be near -- and with -- her dead husband's family in New Jersey, rather than with her parents in Rhode Island. Russell had one dust-up with the law -- a June 2007 arrest for stealing $67 in goods from Old Navy. She acknowledged the theft and gave back the merchandise, according to court records. \u2022 Ruslan Tsarni: The uncle of the accused bombing suspect, he widely condemned the attack on the Boston Marathon, saying nephew Tamerlan \"messed up his life, that's why he decided (to) take lives of innocent people.\" \u2022 Ibragim Todashev: Ibragrim Todashev was Tamerlan's sparring partner at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts gym near Cambridge. The two bonded over Chechnya and religion, sometimes laying out rugs to pray to Mecca inside the small gym. Todashev moved to Florida in fall 2011, not long after a brutal triple slaying in Waltham, Massachusetts. One of the victims was fellow sparring partner Brendan Mess who, along with two friends, were nearly decapitated, with marijuana strewn over their bodies. Authorities began taking a closer look at possible involvement by both Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Todashev, who was allegedly writing out a \"confession\" when, authorities say, he tried to attack an FBI agent. The agent fatally shot Todashev, whose family maintains he is innocent. \u2022 Dias Kadyrbayev: Dias Kadyrbayev, a friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, pleaded guilty to \"obstructing justice with the intent to impede the Boston Marathon bombing investigation,\" and he also pleaded guilty to conspiracy with his actions in the days immediately following the bombing. Kadyrbayev was charged with four counts, including obstructing justice and conspiracy for throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a trash bin after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. Investigators later recovered the backpack at a landfill. Kadyrbayev also took Tsarnaev's computer to his off-campus apartment, where the FBI later seized it. He is awaiting sentencing. 13th Juror: Fishy case could silence accused bomber's pals . \u2022 Azamat Tazhayakov: In July, a jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. Tazhayakov was another friend of Tsarnaev's and was Kadyrbayev's roommate. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both nationals of Kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the United States on student visas while attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Tazhayakov is expected to appeal. \u2022 Robel Phillipos: Robel Phillipos, also a friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, was convicted in October on two counts of lying to federal agents investigating the 2013 bombing. Prosecutors said Phillipos lied to investigators about being in Tsarnaev's college dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth after the bombings. Phillipos knew Tsarnaev from high school. According to court documents, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing. Phillipos has filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and new trial.",

        "article": "After helping families tackle domestic violence as a welfare officer, a Sydney woman has herself become an alleged victim of the epidemic. In a family marred by tragedy, Salwa Haydar became its latest casualty on Monday night when her husband allegedly stabbed the 45-year-old mother to death in their southern Sydney home. Police accuse Haydar Haydar, 58, of killing his wife some time after 6.30pm, before handing himself into Kogarah police station at 7pm. They said the couple's 18-year-old daughter Ola Haydar tried to intervene but suffered serious hand injuries and was taken to hospital. Salwa Haydar was 'violently' murdered in her Bexley home in Sydney's south on Monday evening . Police have charged Haydar with the murder of his wife and wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm in relation to the injury to his daughter. The brutal attack was a shock to former employer, Arab Council CEO Randa Kattan, who knew Mrs Haydar for her work helping other families through domestic violence and troubled times. 'She was very caring, for her family or to her clients,' Ms Kattan told AAP. 'We are absolutely shocked and devastated.' There had been no indication of domestic violence in Ms Haydar's Bexley home, she said. When she died, Ms Haydar had been working for Quitline. Mrs Haydar's death comes nine years after her mother was killed in a bombing in southern Lebanon. She was heartbroken when she learned of the loss via a news report. Her daughter Ola Haydar (pictured) was also injured in the attack, which allegedly took place at the hands of Mrs Haydar's husband Haydar Haydar . 'They said one of the people that (was) killed was my mum, and they said her name and I just went in shock. Like ... I screamed, I hit myself, I said, `It can't be my mum',' she told ABC's Lateline at the time. 'I can't believe it, I still can't believe it.' Superintendent David Donahue said a post mortem revealed the alleged killing was brutal. 'It was quite a violent attack,' he said. 'It's disturbing.' The couple's teenager Ola remains in a Sydney hospital where she is being treated by a specialist surgeon. Haydar will remain in custody following a Kogarah Local Court appearance on Tuesday where he did not apply for bail. Mrs Haydar is pictured here in 2007, speaking about the death of her mother who died in a\u00a0a bombing in southern Lebanon . He briefly looked to a group of supporters in court on Tuesday, who left in tears after police led him away. Magistrate Christine Haskett adjourned the case until April 9 at Central Local Court. Superintendent Donahue said police were still searching for a motive. '(Domestic violence) is a matter that we deal with the most,' he said. 'We deal with it every day.' In the 12 months to September 2014, 24 women in NSW were victims of domestic-violence related murders. In a similar vein Destroy the Joint has been 'counting dead women', in a campaign aimed at highlighting the domestic violence epidemic in Australia. According to their findings Mrs Haydar is the 26th woman to die a violent death in Australia in 2015 alone. Of those 26, 18 of the deceased knew the alleged perpetrator.

        "article": "Beijing (CNN)Five years ago, Beijinger Robert Zhao went on a trip to Tibet. What he encountered left him confused but intrigued. A science graduate from China's elite Tsinghua University, he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion, but in the culture and devotion of the Buddhists he met he found something worth knowing. Now 25, he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk. \"It means I will have to give up everything of the ordinary world,\" he told CNN. While Buddhism has a long history in China, entering via missionaries from India during the Han dynasty, it was repressed during the Maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and monks actively punished for believing in \"superstition.\" But now, a growing number of Chinese are rediscovering the country's dormant Buddhist traditions. Some, like Zhao, are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive,  fast-changing society. Others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering. However, it's not always easy to combine Buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life. Zhao works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company. His religion means it's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role. \"Not drinking, smoking or eating meat affects my socializing. So the company has to send someone else to go with me, which creates extra expenses,\" he says. Zhao has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet, fearing that they might oppose it. Fenggang Yang, the director of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, Indiana, says it's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to Buddhism. Some discover it at university, where Buddhist groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures.  Others have devout parents and grandparents. He also says that the Chinese Communist Party policy has \"moved toward treating Buddhism more favorably than other religions.\" Christianity has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on Christians,  with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from skylines. In particular, it's the Tibetan strain of Buddhism, rather than the Chan (also called Zen) tradition once popular in China, that is attracting new converts, particularly students, young professionals and businesspeople, he says. \"It appears that both the chanting and the physical, spiritual practices of Tibetan Buddhism are appealing to some people,\" Yang added. To what extent these new converts are committed to Buddhism as a religion, with its strictures and rituals, is an open question. A former leader of a university Buddhism group, who didn't want to give his name, told CNN he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice. Activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined Buddhist scriptures, he added. Yang at Purdue University says that for most people in China, Buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion. They may visit temples or read Buddhist books, but  few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment. \"Indeed, people who identify as Buddhists do a lot of non-Buddhist spiritual things, such as believing in feng shui, consulting fortune-tellers, practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions,\" he says. On a recent weekend, more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of Beijing Ren Ai Foundation, a Buddhist charitable organization, at Longquan Monastery on the mountainous outskirts of the capital. Zhong Ying, the group's 32-year-old deputy secretary general, said the group's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old. In the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200. For attendee Geng Hui'er, a 26-year-old who works and lives in Beijing, Buddhism was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in England. Growing up, her family had raised her Buddhist although she says she never really \"felt it.\" She now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers. Geng says Buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties. It's also helped her establish a network of people she can talk to and socialize with. \"We sit together, sharing things that have happened in our lives and how we dealt with them, which is more helpful than reading books\", she says. For Zhao, the aspiring monk, Buddhism has been a balm while dealing with poor health, as well as work and relationship problems. \"My life has been tough for years. (Buddhism) keeps me away from the negative thoughts, like a reminder that's always there, which has helped me a lot.\" Journalist Dou Yiping contributed to this report.",

        "article": "England\u2019s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in a row has been labelled \u2018unacceptable\u2019 by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie, with head coach Stuart Lancaster told performances must improve before the World Cup. Lancaster\u2019s men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France on Saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling Ireland and securing a first title since 2011. But Ritchie said: \u2018Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about. We should be winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. England are left reeling on the pitch as their 55-35 victory against France failed to secure the title . Captain Chris Robshaw (fourth right) looks dejected after England concede a try to France at Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster (left) and his players ponder a second-placed finish for a fourth successive season . \u2018We had opportunities, let\u2019s be clear \u2014 entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough. There\u2019s no point in bleating about it. \u2018We didn\u2019t take opportunities, didn\u2019t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.\u2019 But there was more than a little sense that Ian Ritchie was playing to his audience at Twickenham. And not only because the RFU\u2019s affable chief executive quoted Hamlet when describing the \u2018slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\u2019 he experienced watching the engrossing Six Nations denouement. His public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six-year contracts served to England\u2019s coaches last year. They were also designed as a shot across head coach Stuart Lancaster\u2019s bows. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (right) chats to Lancaster at England's base in Pennyhill Park in Bagshot . Ritchie (left) and Lancaster talk in the Twickenham stands prior to England's clash with New Zealand . Ritchie, an intelligent and thoughtful man, needed very little pressing to deliver the headline-grabbing line that England\u2019s fourth successive runners-up spot under Lancaster was \u2018unacceptable\u2019. Often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure. Yesterday it took two. It was almost as if Ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance. This was no slip of the tongue. More a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on Lancaster. The aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public\u2019s eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal-hit 2011 World Cup campaign. Ritchie, the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch, felt the need to crack the whip. Just not too hard. \u2018Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,\u2019 said the former chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. \u2018If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot of things, we should be, as a country, winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things. We had opportunities, let\u2019s be clear \u2014 entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. \u2018We did not do enough over the five matches. There\u2019s no point in bleating about it. We simply didn\u2019t take opportunities, didn\u2019t do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win.\u2019 England winger Jack Nowell bursts through for the first of his two tries against Les Bleus . In six months, the RFU will host a tournament which is predicted to generate close to \u00a31billion for the UK economy. Success for the home nation on the field is critical for fans, sponsors, media and administrators alike. The RFU\u2019s strategic vision, which Ritchie helped draw up, decreed that England should head into the World Cup with a Six Nations title under their belt and a world ranking no lower than second. For all the brilliance of Saturday\u2019s seven-try triumph over France, watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television, they have achieved neither. But the natural question if results are \u2018unacceptable\u2019 is \u2018so what are the consequences?\u2019 Surely there is no point having targets if shoulders are simply shrugged when they are not met. But, with six-year deals secured, the reality is that Lancaster and his tight-knit coaching team of Andy Farrell, Mike Catt and Graham Rowntree are going nowhere in a hurry. \u2018It\u2019s quite right in any management to have targets,\u2019 insisted Ritchie. \u2018But they\u2019re not the be-all and end-all. You\u2019ve got to look around at the totality of what\u2019s going on, where we are and what we believe. Frontline players such as Owen Farrell (left) and Manu Tuilagi were unavailable for the Six Nations . \u2018Have we missed some targets? Well, yes. We wanted to win the Six Nations. We wanted to be ranked two in the world. \u2018We remain confident and optimistic with a belief we can do well at the World Cup. We remain absolutely confident, happy and committed to the team that we\u2019ve got on the coaching staff.\u2019 England were hamstrung by injuries in the build-up to the tournament. No fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over Wales in Cardiff and first-choice stars Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Owen Farrell were absent for the duration. Stuart Lancaster with his tight-knit coaching team of Graham Rowntree (left), Mike Catt and Andy Farrell . That resulted in the emphasis being placed on youngsters such as George Ford, Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph, with Lancaster and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged. But Ritchie, the man in charge of a union which makes more than twice as much money as any other in the world and has access to more players, added: \u2018\u201cWe\u2019re developing, this is a development opportunity\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t take that. \u2018We\u2019ve got the resources, the talent, the ability. We\u2019ve got to make sure we come out for the World Cup and deliver.\u2019",

Rory McIlroy is certainly mixing with the right company as he finalises his preparations for his tilt at the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Not just the greats of this sport, either. While on a two-day trip to Augusta last week, the Northern Irishman hit the gym at 6am \u2014 and was joined shortly afterwards by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. \u2018When they came in it was my cue to walk out,\u2019 said McIlroy, smiling. \u2018When you think it\u2019s their off-season, it was quite something to see their dedication. They\u2019re both in their late 30s and it emphasised their determination to prolong their careers.\u2019 Rory McIlroy greets fans while walking to the ninth tee during a pro-am at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Amazing what a pep trip to Augusta can do for a man \u2014 that, and a long weekend practice session with his long-time coach, Michael Bannon. When last seen at the Cadillac Championship at Doral 10 days ago McIlroy cut a dispirited figure as he completed the second of two disappointing tournaments in Florida. Here at Bay Hill, on the eve of his first appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, there was a spring to his stride once more. \u2018I certainly feel a lot better about my game than I did at Doral,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I think this course sets up well for me. Practising the last two days has left me ruing the fact I haven\u2019t played here in the past.\u2019 McIlroy watches his tee shot on the ninth hole during a pro-am Arnold Palmer Invitational  tournament . The accent was clearly on relaxation rather than reconnaissance when McIlroy took his dad Gerry, a former scratch handicap player himself, up to Augusta last Thursday. \u2018I think it gave him an appreciation of what it takes to play the course off the back tees,\u2019 said Rory. \u2018He\u2019s always asking me why I did this and that when I come off the course. Now I think he knows what we go through.\u2019 McIlroy was coy when asked about his score, noting merely that he played well on the first day. Which probably means a 64 or 65. This is his last scheduled tournament before the Masters in three weeks and, in the absence of eight-time winner Tiger Woods, the local community is certainly glad he\u2019s here. McIlroy  looks over a shot during the pro-am round prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy slaps hands with a young fan, while walking between holes in Orlando . McIlroy plays a shot at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Orlando during the pro-am . \u2018Welcome Rory,\u2019 proclaims a huge sign hanging from a house near the 18th green. \u2018It was very nice of them to do that and it summed up the reception I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve arrived,\u2019 said the 25-year-old. McIlroy begins on Thursday in a belter of a threeball alongside good friend Rickie Fowler and another of Augusta\u2019s highly-fancied players \u2014 gifted Australian Jason Day. Also in the field are  world No 3 Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott, and among the British and Irish contingent are Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell, Paul Casey, Danny Willett and Padraig Harrington. McIlroy has scheduled the Arnold Palmer Invitational as his last event before the Masters in three weeks . As for that talk with the Golden Bear, McIlroy was asking about pin placements on certain greens when Nicklaus said: \u2018Never forget, Rory \u2014 if you\u2019re in doubt, the middle of the green is never a bad place to be at Augusta.\u2019 For a player who has certainly been guilty of playing too aggressively on occasion in the past that might prove the most sage piece of advice of all.",

        "article": "Simon Mignolet believes Liverpool are showing the fighting spirit necessary to qualify for the Champions League as they head into Sunday's seismic showdown with Manchester United at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers' in-form Reds survived a first-half fright at Swansea on Monday night before emerging 1-0 winners to cut the gap on fourth-placed United to two points. Mignolet had to produce fine stops to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson in a first half Swansea dominated but Jordan Henderson's fortunate winner gave Liverpool their fifth successive Barclays Premier League victory. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet punches a cross clear during his side's 1-0 win against Swansea . Captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Mignolet after the Reds' fifth successive Premier League victory . 'We showed the character and resilience during the game that you need if you're going to be successful,' Mignolet said. 'This was our sixth successive clean sheet away from home and we have to keep that going until the end of the season. 'You keep those clean sheets as a whole team. Everyone is playing together, doing their job and willing to fight for each other.' Liverpool have not lost in the league since a 3-0 defeat at United on December 14 when the stuttering Mignolet was dropped and replaced by Brad Jones. But Mignolet soon reclaimed his place and both he and Liverpool have gone from strength to strength ever since, the Merseysiders now unbeaten in 13 league games and Rodgers insisting they can catch second-placed Manchester City who are currently four points better off than his men. United's visit on Sunday might go a long way to determining if that ambition is feasible but Mignolet insists Liverpool have to focus solely on themselves and not their rivals for a top-four spot. Liverpool's players celebrate after Jordan Henderson's decisive second half goal at the Liberty Stadium . Mignolet pulls off an acrobatic save to deny Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal . 'This win sets up the next game and that's a big game of course,' Mignolet said. 'But we don't have to make too much of it, there's three points there and we have to try to do our best to get the win at home. 'We just have to look at our own performances, there's no point in looking at the other teams, and keep doing what we've been doing in the last few months. 'We've still got all the big teams to play but the important thing is we don't look too forward ahead of ourselves.' Mignolet does not resemble the goalkeeper who visibly appeared anxious and made regular mistakes during the first half of the season. As well as his precious first-half saves at the Liberty Stadium he was commanding in the air and punched well under pressure, but he puts his impressive record down to those in front of him. 'As a goalkeeper you're depending on the rest of the team to keep those clean sheets,' he said. 'You can't do that on your own and that's what's pleasing. Henderson scores the only goal of the game as the ball cannons off his shin fortuitously . The England midfielder celebrates in front of Liverpool's travelling contingent at the Liberty Stadium . 'Everybody's doing their job, is organised and that makes life easy for a goalkeeper. 'We had to fight at Swansea to get through to 0-0 at half-time but the second half we got the goal and that came with putting a lot more pressure on the ball.' Swansea defender Jordi Amat felt Garry Monk's side paid the price for failing to turn their first-half superiority into a lead. The Spaniard played an unwitting role in Henderson's winner as his attempted clearance clattered off the Liverpool midfielder and flew over Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal. 'It was an unlucky goal for us,' said Amat, who was making his first league start since September after Federico Fernandez had returned home to his native Argentina to attend personal matters. 'I don't know what happened because I was on the floor but I think we deserved a draw. 'We were playing very well in the first half but we couldn't score one or two goals. 'In the second half we suffered a little bit and we have to analyse that to see what happened.'",

This is according to SpaceX-founder Elon Musk who claims that when computers become smarter than people, they will treat them like 'pet Labradors'. His comments were made in a recent interview with scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who added that computers could choose to breed docile humans and eradicate the violent ones. Scroll down for video and audio . SpaceX-founder Elon Musk (right) says robots will someday treat humans like pets.In a recent interview with scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson (left), Musk said his fears revolve around 'superintelligence' Musk: 'I mean, we won't be like a pet Labrador if we're lucky,' Musk said. Tyson: 'A pet Lab' Musk: 'I have a pet Labrador by the way.' Tyson: 'We'll be their pets.' Musk: 'It's like the friendliest creature.' Tyson: 'No, they'll domesticate us.' Musk: 'Yes! Exactly' Tyson: 'So we'll be lab pets to them.' Musk: 'Yes. Or something strange is going to happen.' Tyson: 'They'll keep the docile humans and get rid of the violent ones. Musk: 'Yeah.' Tyson: 'And then breed the docile humans.' Listen to the full interview here. Elon Musk has already likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. But in his latest interview, Musk said his fears revolve around something known as superintelligence. This, according to author Nick Bostrom, is 'any intellect that greatly exceed the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest.' 'I mean, we won't be like a pet Labrador if we're lucky,' Musk told\u00a0Tyson, adding that we may become lab pets to them. Tyson theorised that robots will 'Get rid of the violent ones...And then breed the docile humans'. Musk also said humanity needs to be careful about what it programs superintelligent robots to do. He uses the example of asking them to find out what makes people happy. 'It may conclude that all unhappy humans should be terminated,' Musk said. 'Or that we should all be captured with dopamine and serotonin directly injected into our brains to maximise happiness because it's concluded that dopamine and serotonin are what cause happiness, therefore maximise it.' Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, this week made similar comments\u00a0during an interview with Paul Smith at Australian Financial Review. The 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality. Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, this week made similar comments.\u00a0The 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality. He asked:\u00a0'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on?' He quipped: 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on?' 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question,' he added. 'If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently. He also directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. They are part of a group of experts, known collectively as the Future of Life Institute, who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question,' said Wozniak. 'If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.\u00a0Aldebaran's human-like robot is pictured . The authors said there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. Earlier this month Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots. The entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply 'too dangerous' behind the wheel. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example . A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent. This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. And at the start of the month,\u00a0Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees. Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just \u00a36.80 per night.",

        "article": "A schoolgirl who was arrested by armed officers and held in a cell overnight says she was targeted because police mistook an afro-comb she was carrying for a gun. Rochae Davis says she was walking with friends in Croydon, south London, with the comb tucked into the waistband of her trousers. Police already on their way to the scene were alerted to CCTV footage which they say purported to show the 15-year-old carrying a gun and later arrested her at home. Rochae Davis, 15, pictured with her mother Simone, says she was arrested by armed police because they mistook an afro-comb tucked into her waistband for a gun . She was bailed without charge and must return to a police station in April as the investigation continues. But, with police yet to recover a weapon, the schoolgirl claims she was only arrested because police jumped to conclusions. 'As I was walking back with a friend, six police officers from Trident, the gun crime unit arrived, and had guns. They pushed us against a wall and searched us,' she said. 'It was only after they had finished that they said they had seen me on CCTV with a firearm. But it was an afro comb - it didn't look anything like a gun. 'I was scared and confused. I said I didn't have a gun, but it was so unfair, they wouldn't hear me out. 'I didn't know what was happening. They took my clothes and my stuff - it was really uncomfortable.' Rochae's mother, Simone, said police's treatment of her daughter had been 'a disgrace' and that the schoolgirl had 'never been in trouble' with the law before. The schoolgirl said she 'didn't know what was happening' when she was taken to a police station and held overnight. Officers did not find the comb (above) when they searched her house as, she says, she had given it back to a friend . Rochae was bailed without charge but must return to a police station next month. A police spokesman said inquiries were ongoing . 'If they thought they saw her with a gun on CCTV then why didn't they stop and search her there and then,' the 33-year-old said. She added police may have thought Rochae was a young boy because she had her hood up at the time. The six-inch afro comb, which has a black handle and metal prongs, belonged to the teenager's friend, she said. Police did not find it when searching the family's home on the night of her arrest with Rochae claiming she had already given it back to a friend. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'As officers were responding, police were contacted by the local authority CCTV control room, which was also monitoring the incident, with information that a female had been seen with what was believed to be a firearm in the area. 'Police arrived and a number of people were dispersed. A short while later, officers stopped a 15-year-old girl in Poplar Walk and she was subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm. 'No firearm has been recovered at this stage. Detectives from Croydon CID are investigating and inquiries continue.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "A North Carolina father was acquitted of strangling to death his 4-year-old son and trying to kill his other two children after the defense successfully argued that the man's 'violent sleepwalking' was to blame for the tragedy. A jury on Wednesday decided unanimously that Joseph Anthony Mitchell is not guilty of murder and attempted murder after an expert witness said he was effectively unconscious at the time of his attacks four years ago. Jurors had asked Superior Court Judge James Roberson if they could consider a lesser verdict of manslaughter, but the judge said it was all or nothing: murder, or not guilty. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: Christine Perolini, second from left, is comforted by friends and family on Wednesday after her ex-husband, Joseph Anthony Mitchell, is found not guilty of killing their four-year-old son . Sleepwalking defense: Mitchell's attorney argued that his client (left) was not conscious of the night of September 22, 2010, when he strangled to death his 4-year-old son, Blake (right) Desperate cry:\u00a0Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him' Devastated:\u00a0Christine Perolini was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher . Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict, but made no comment as he walked out of court a free man. His ex-wife, Christine Perolini, was so stunned by the ruling that she hyperventilated and had to be wheeled out on a stretcher surrounded by her family. Reacting to the verdict, the grieving mother exclaimed in court: 'I failed. I couldn't save him [Blake].' Mitchell testified that he was in financial distress and had not been sleeping well around the time of 4-year-old Blake Mitchell's death in September 2010. Prosecutors said those financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill the others. Mitchell's 13-year-old and 10-year-old children testified in court that they fought him off. But a defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in 'non-REM parasomnia,' a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously. Because of this disorder, he was incapable of exercising criminal intent, the expert said. A psychologist who testified for the prosecution after repeatedly interviewing Mitchell said he had no mental condition that would have left him unconscious during the attacks, and that he must have consciously planned them. Mitchell's trial lasted a month but it took the jury less than four hours to return a not guilty verdict. Following Mitchell's acquittal, some members of the jury panel spoke out saying that they did not believe the sleepwalking defense, but their hands were tied. Prosecutors said extreme financial difficulties drove Mitchell to strangle the toddler and try to kill his two older children . Emotional:\u00a0Mitchell, 50, sobbed after the shocking verdict . He left the courtroom a free man . Daddy's boy: A defense expert said Mitchell's stress and lack of sleep likely resulted in a sleep disorder whose sufferers can perform random acts unconsciously- including killing his son . Speaking to the station WRAL, one juror said she was \u2018embarrassed\u2019 to be a part of this case and compared the experience to being 'dragged into someone else's nightmare.' The woman said that she and her fellow jurors had no choice but to acquit Blake Mitchell's killer of first-degree murder. \u2018We would have definitely convicted him of manslaughter,\u2019 the juror said. \u2018We felt like our hands were tied.\u2019 Referring of Mitchell, whom the prosecution painted as a serial liar and a man desperate to get out of a financial bind, another juror said: \u2018I didn't believe one word out of that man's mouth.' The general opinion on the jury panel was that the prosecution had to prove malice and intent to get a conviction on a first-degree murder charge, but they failed to do it. During the month-long trial, defense attorney Jay Ferguson asked Judge James Roberts to allow the jury to consider an involuntary manslaughter conviction, but his request was denied. Alexis Mitchel (top right), now 18 years old, said in court that her father tried to push her head between her bed and a wall while wearing a Halloween mask. She fought back and survived, as did her other brother, Devin (far left) Free man: Joe Mitchell is pictured here Wednesday evening leaving left the jail accompanied by his lawyer and carrying several garbage bags filled with his possessions . Mitchell has never denied strangling his son Blake on the night of September 22, 2010, at the family's foreclosed home in Hillsborough, North Carolina, but his attorney argued that he did it uncontrollably and without malice while sleepwalking. Prosecutors described how Joe Mitchell tried to push his daughter's head between her bed and a wall while wearing a Halloween mask. The girl fought back and survived, along with her brother Devin, reported ABC11. Blake, however, was not as lucky. Alexis Mitchell, now 18 years old, said in court she passed out and was later awakened by her baby brother's screams. \u2018I remember seeing my father on my other little brother [Devin], and I tried to get him off of him,\u2019 Alexis testified. \u2018He was trying to hurt him. I ran to my mother\u2019s room and told her what was happening, and she told me to go get my brothers.\u2019 When Alexis returned to her siblings\u2019 room, she picked up Blake in her arms, not knowing he was dying. The teen said she thought the toddler was asleep. At around 6pm Wednesday, Joe Mitchell left the jail a free man accompanied by his lawyer and carrying several garbage bags filled with his possessions. Defense attorney Jay Ferguson told the station the acquittal is bittersweet for the 50-year-old man, who has no money and no home after spending four years behind bars. He added that it is his client\u2019s wish to reunite with his ex-wife and surviving children.",

        "article": "A young woman who vanished as a teenager may have been found hundreds of miles from home. Ashley Summers of Cleveland, Ohio is believed to have been spotted in video footage taken from a bank ATM in Warwick, Rhode Island this January, eight years after the 14-year-old first was reported as missing. This as the FBI has revealed she may be wanted in connection with check theft and identity fraud in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Ashley Summers may have been spotted in Rhode Island (above) eight years after she disappeared from Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 14 . Summers is seen at 14-years-old (left) and in an age progression photo at 20-years-old (right) This is the car the woman believed to be Summers was spotted in at a bank in Rhode Island . NBC News\u00a0reports that Summers' step-grandmother Linda stumbled across the photo when the FBI posted it online looking for information about the woman, at which point she immediately sent photos of Summers to the Warwick Police Department as they searched for leads in locating the woman. When that did not work, the FBI stepped in to launch a wider search, even posting billboards along the East Coast. Despite the young woman's possible criminal activity, this would be amazing news for the family as some believed Summers may have been a victim of Ariel Castro, the Cleveland kidnapper who held three woman against their will in his House of Horrors for years. Michelle Knight, one of the victims, said upon her release that she remembered another girl being at the house at some point around the time Summers first disappeared on July 6, 2007. Knight said the victim disappeared shortly after. Authorities immediately believed the girl could have been Summers as she lived in the same neighborhood as Castro. It was thought by some that she may have been kidnapped by Ariel Castro and kept at his House of Horrors (above), which was in her Cleveland neighborhood . Summers' mother, Jennifer, has always been firm in her belief that her daughter was taken against her will and would never have run off from home on her own. Summers was living with an uncle at the time of his disappearance, arguing with the man shortly before she vanished. She may have called her mother a year later, who claims she received a call from a woman who said; 'It's me mom. Dont worry.' And as the FBI calls on the public to help locate this woman, Summers' mother is hoping she will finally be able to see her daughter again after all these years and 'erase the pain' she has felt since that day in 2007. 'There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,' said\u00a0FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson. Anyone with any information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).",

        "article": "I spent a good chunk of my 20s in love - with my boyfriend Matt and with New York City, where we lived for five amazing, crazy years. He got a great job over there and I followed, leaving behind family, friends and my job. People thought I was mad to drop everything and run but I never had any doubts. And even if it had all gone wrong, I could always have flown back to life in Britain. Scroll down for video . Tying the knot:\u00a0Matt and Liz looking nervous before their wedding ceremony at\u00a0Manhattan\u2019s City Hall- the same place Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw finally married Big . Liz and Matt pose in front of Brooklyn Bridge before their wedding in New York . When I needed to get a visa to stay, we thought about getting married, but then I landed a dream job and sorted out my own paperwork to keep working in the US. We became a tight-knit team of two and whilst other friends diligently alternated between his and hers families for Christmas, we did our own thing, eating turkey sandwiches from a corner deli, or inviting NYC friends for eclectic English/Ukrainian/French/Italian parties. When we got new jobs back in London and returned in the depths of winter it was a damp, dreary December nothing like the magical snowy Christmases we'd been used to. It was difficult adjusting to home when New York felt like our real home. But we cheered up when we got engaged in February and were looking forward to returning to Manhattan for a holiday in June. I don't know whose idea it was to get married in New York, but about a fortnight before our trip we both seemed to have the idea at once. It seemed so obvious because the city was such a huge part of our lives together. Sworn to secrecy!\u00a0Best friend Robin Hobbs was the only witness to Liz and Matt\u2019s wedding . Selfie time: The bride and groom were casually dressed in matching white and smiled for selfies on the way to their wedding . I looked into it and it was pretty straightforward - apply for licence, wait 24 hours, take one witness, turn up on the day and queue at New York's City Hall with all the other brides and grooms. I knew I had to tell my parents but it wasn't so much a matter of getting permission as casually dropping it into conversation at breakfast. 'We're thinking of getting married in New York,' I said. 'If you really don't want us to, we might not.' Stunned silence, then huge grins. Mum always maintains she knew we'd do it before we really knew ourselves. It was easy to keep quiet - our English friends just thought we were excited about the trip, and we swore our witness Robin to secrecy. He was our best friend, an Englishman in New York who'd recently moved to Boston and understood the pull of the city as much as we did. Wedding feast: Robin enjoys a hot dog in downtown Manhattan right after the wedding. The couple toasted the union with street vendor hot dogs and Champagne in plastic glasses . Arty reception: The newlyweds had cocktails on the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art - where Liz furtively tossed the wedding bouquet over Jeff Koons\u2019 Balloon Dog sculpture . We wanted a get out clause just in case Robin couldn't get time off work or we changed our minds at the last minute - another reason why a secret wedding seemed the right thing to do. I worried English friends and family would be disappointed they couldn't be there for the fun. But we also wanted it to be our wedding, about us as a couple, not about what colour the napkins needed to be, or who to sit where on the table plan, or what type of saucepans to put on a wedding list. The day itself was brilliant. We walked across Brooklyn Bridge towards City Hall - something we'd done so many times before, sightseeing with family, or after drunken nights out in quirky bars or warehouse parties. Tourists cheered us and it felt like the whole city was our friend. City Hall itself was an unforgettable experience - my bouquet was unceremoniously dumped on the security scanner belt and checked for concealed weapons, just like everything else, because the building housed law courts filled with plenty of 'no-goodniks'. There was a lot of hanging around, form-filling, queuing for official stamps and then the ceremony itself - barely five minutes to say 'I do' and for Matt to pretend my engagement ring was a wedding ring. Party time: Liz embraces a guest as the couple celebrate their marriage with friends in the Boxcar Lounge, one of their favourite East Village bars . A married man:\u00a0Matt pops open a bottle of champagne with friends . The blushing bride: Liz and Matt leaving the Boxcar Lounge on their wedding night . We celebrated with hot dogs from a street vendor and champagne in plastic glasses. Our New York friends were out in force after work - we'd suggested a drinking session and when a few cried off we had to admit we had 'an appointment at City Hall' and they might want to rearrange plans to join us on a pub crawl that kicked off with cocktails on the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Everyone promised to keep Champagne photos off Facebook and any wedding-related chat had to stay in New York because I was terrified the news would get back to England before we did. Thankfully they kept quiet and when we flew back to London we began a mammoth ring-round to tell our nearest and dearest that we'd had a lovely holiday thank you, and oh yes, we decided to get married while we were there. Matt was nervous phoning his mum and dad - we'd tried to call them on the wedding day but they were on holiday in Cornwall and had no mobile reception. To say they were surprised would be an understatement - fortunately they were (and still are) very happy for us. Most of our friends were thrilled. Every phone call followed the same pattern - unexpected announcement followed by exclamations, laughter and promises to email pictures, as if some definite proof were required. Older relatives asked what vows we'd said; I had no idea and had to look them up online. But we kept everyone sweet by promising an epic party on our first anniversary, and true to our word we planned a marquee-full of drinks, dinner and dancing with a healthy mix of English friends and New York guests who'd experienced it all the first time round. I walked up the aisle exactly a year later and renewed those vows, only this time I said: 'I did.'",

Irving Diaz, who was pictured in June with his hands around the waist of a female companion, has received another complaint  after a his girlfriend was seen behind the wheel of his authorized vehicle while wearing 'short shorts'. According to an internal document he was spotted in the passenger seat, without wearing uniform, while Rebecca Guzman-Phillips, 24, was driving to the Jacksonville chain of the bar on October 6. Scroll down for video . Irving Diaz, who was pictured in June embracing a woman and grabbing her rear, has received another complaint against him after a female in 'short shorts' was spotted behind the wheel of his authorized vehicle . It is not clear whether it is the same woman involved in each incident. Guzman-Phillips was described as being 'scantily-clad' and wearing short shorts at the time, the\u00a0Florida Times Union\u00a0reported. The manager at the restaurant said she didn't work there. According to an internal affairs report, he explained his choices were just a 'bad mistake' The investigation also revealed that Diaz had checked the woman's name in a database to check if she had any outstanding warrants to her name. Just two days before Guzman-Phillips is said to have driven the car again. The husband of Diaz's ex-wife, Jonathan Potter, was dropping Diaz's children off for a scheduled visit when he saw the 24-year-old get out of his vehicle and run into the house, again wearing 'short shorts'. Diaz admitted to investigators that he allowed Guzman-Phillips to drive his patrol car twice in October. According to the report is explanation was that he had made a 'bad decision'. The internal affairs department handed him two counts of improper action and one count each of unbecoming conduct,. The counts added to repeated infractions of unbecoming conduct, in relation to the photograph taken earlier last year, and improper use of computer software. 'The investigation and discipline speak for itself,\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Melissa Bujeda told the paper. 'There will be no other statement in reference to this incident.'

        "article": "Scotland may not have won at Twickenham since 1983 \u2014 but captain Greig Laidlaw insists there is no reason why Vern Cotter\u2019s men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend. From what he has seen in his first season in the Aviva Premiership with Gloucester, Laidlaw reckons England\u2019s players are anything but invincible. They are good, he says, but no better than those currently wearing the dark blue. Scotland captain greig Laidlaw (above) insists that England are not invincible ahead of Saturday's clash . \u2018I\u2019ve always thought highly of the England players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win,\u2019 said Laidlaw. \u2018They are not invincible, that\u2019s definitely not the case. \u2018I believe they are good players but you look at Glasgow Warriors when they played Bath in Europe this season and how well they did. \u2018Bath were going well in the Premiership but Glasgow beat them at home and arguably could have won down there, too. It wasn\u2019t really Glasgow\u2019s first team as they had a lot of injuries that day \u2014 and it probably was close to Bath\u2019s first team.\u2019 Laidlaw\u2019s emotions are running high ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash, especially after team-mate Stuart Hogg told Sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for Scottish rugby south of the border. Laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the Six Nations, based on the experiences of his first season with Gloucester, following his move from Edinburgh. Scotland full back Stuart Hogg (left) accused the English of lacking respect for Scottish rugby . For Laidlaw, a win at Twickenham will not only belatedly ignite Scotland\u2019s Six Nations campaign, following defeats to France, Wales and Italy, it will give him bragging rights in the Gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a Scot south of the border. \u2018Respect has to be earned and that is something we\u2019ll be aiming to do at the weekend,\u2019 he said. \u2018The England boys will respect us if we do a job on the field. \u2018We\u2019re not far away from getting things right but I\u2019m getting pretty sick of telling people that, I really am. It\u2019s up to us as players to step up, go again and put in that performance against England. \u2018We have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to Italy \u2014 but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change. \u2018We have now seen both sides of Vern Cotter this week. He is a hard man and rightly so. He has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about \u2014 and that\u2019s good. We know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from Twickenham with a positive result.\u2019 Laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead Scotland to what would be a famous victory at Twickenham. The first is to emulate his uncle, Roy Laidlaw, who helped his team to a Calcutta Cup win back in 1983. The other is to wipe out the memory of last year\u2019s 20-0 defeat by England at BT Murrayfield. It still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a Scotland shirt. England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield last year after a 20-0 victory . Nothing went right for Laidlaw that day and, after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game, the Scotland skipper was replaced by Chris Cusiter after 65 minutes. The boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt Laidlaw and he knows that defeat, on top of Scotland\u2019s dreadful Six Nations campaign so far this season, makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of English rugby. \u2018That was personally one of my worst games for Scotland, to be honest,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I don\u2019t think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason. \u2018It was made worse because we were playing England. It is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud \u2014 and we didn\u2019t. \u2018Vern\u2019s analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous Six Nations tournaments and he has been on our case. He has certainly been on my case, that\u2019s for sure, after he brought up that match. \u2018We\u2019ve had a look at that last game when we lost 20-0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again. \u2018We certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this Six Nations, if we can, by winning at Twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is England down there. \u2018I\u2019ve talked to my uncle Roy about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history. \u2018It\u2019s up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them \u2014 and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room.\u2019 England centre Luther Burrell is mobbed by his team-mates after he scored a try in last year's match . Much will rest on the performance of second-row Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday. He has already come of age for Scotland and is calling the line-outs. In the absence of big brother Richie through injury, there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders. There was an indication against the Italians of how much Gray is respected by Cotter when, with Laidlaw taken off and vice-captain Ross Ford off injured, he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game. It was a dream come true for the second row, who knows he has a huge role to play against England. \u2018It\u2019s very special to be a part of the Scotland squad in the first place, then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about,\u2019 he said. \u2018To have done that, even if for only a couple of minutes against Italy, was a huge honour and a very special feeling. Jonny Gray (above) will have a big role to play if Scotland are to upset the odds and beat England . \u2018The result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now. \u2018We have been looking at the England game and what we need to fix and we\u2019re just training hard to try to get it right. \u2018It will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough England team. They have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs, so that is an area we will be working hard on this week.\u2019",

But even Angelina Jolie had to start her career somewhere \u2013 and that meant modelling clothes for Debenhams and Miss Selfridge for a little-known British magazine. The long lost pictures, taken when Jolie was just 18, were published under the headline 'Honeychild' in Look in 1993. Scroll down for video . Angelina Jolie started her career modelling clothes for Debenhams and Miss Selfridge in tiny British style magazine Look aged 18, pictured\u00a0reaching for the sky on a beach . The long lost pictures, taken when Jolie was just 18, were published under the headline 'Honeychild' in Look in 1993 and included shots of her\u00a0squatting on the floor of a desert wearing a headband . And Angelina was such an unknown that even her name was misspelled \u2013 with a 'j' replacing the 'g' in her first name in a caption. Living in Los Angeles in her late teens, Angelina signed to the Nina Blanchard agency after her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, suggested she do some modelling. In the pictures she is seen in two separate shoots: squatting on the floor of a desert, and kneeling on a beach and reaching for the sky. It is not known if she agreed with the magazine's claim that 'beige is not boring \u2013 it encourages people to open up to you.' Angelina was such an unknown that even her first name was misspelled \u2013 with a 'j' replacing the 'g' It is not known if she agreed with the magazine's claim that 'beige is not boring \u2013 it encourages people to open up to you' Angelina also made her professional acting debut in 1993, playing her first leading role in the science-fiction film Cyborg 2. Three years later, she appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon, prompting the Hollywood Reporter to write: 'Jolie is an actress whom the camera truly adores.' Then came the role of Lara Croft in Tomb Raider in 2001, and it was clear that a major new star had been born. Angelina is now married to Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt and the couple have six children.

The gorgeous neck-pleat detail could only be couture and the shoulder-cape finish is perfectly on-trend. Ralph & Russo designed this piece with summer in mind, but the colour keeps popping up on the red carpet this season (think J-Law at The Hunger Games premiere).

        "article": "What is the last thing you remember about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? For Messi, it is most likely him tearing Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City apart, making them look like a League One team lost in Europe, nutmegging James Milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside. For Ronaldo, it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain, sulking back to the halfway line, protesting even though team-mate Gareth Bale had just put Real Madrid 1-0 up against Levante. Lionel Messi may well be priceless as the Barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career . Messi smiles during Barcelona's win over Manchester City that knocked them out of the Champions League . Cristiano Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration during Real Madrid's last match against Levante . It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve fast for El Clasico against Messi's Barcelona . It is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet. Yet there is currently no debate to be had. Not even close. The headlines this week belong to Messi, even if he didn't break a Champions League record on Wednesday and his free-kicks served only to remind us he is human after all. There was more to his embarrassment of Manchester City than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament. Much more. If it wasn't his menacing dribbles, it was his six shots against a magnificent Joe Hart. If it wasn't his assist for Ivan Rakitic's goal, it was his nutmeg on Milner that reduced Pep Guardiola \u2013 the architect of the Barcelona way and current Bayern Munich manager \u2013 to nothing more than another supporter in the stands. The one-twos, the drops of the shoulder, the shimmies. Pep has seen it all before \u2013 at the Nou Camp, at their Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training ground, at almost every stadium he took Barcelona to \u2013 yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief. He wasn't alone. Barcelona's Messi taunts the City defence on the edge of the penalty area during another classy performance . Messi joins in the celebrations after Ivan Rakitic's opening goal with Luis Suarez (right) at the Nou Camp . Messi's heat map showed he was very active in the City half. Click here for more from our Match Zone service . Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantastic' Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport . Should we have expected anything less? Messi has been untouchable this year. So much so it's almost unfair, and part of the credit can even go to \u2013 dare we say it? \u2013 his nemesis, Ronaldo. It was on January 12 when the Real Madrid man got the better of the Barca boy for the 2014 Ballon d'Or award, three weeks after Ronaldo returned to his hometown of Funchal on the island of Madeira to unveil a statue of himself. Before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Ronaldo beat Messi in goals (33 to 25), goals per game (1.18 to 1), minutes per goal (70.94 to 87.24), shots (119 to 96), minutes-per-goal involvement (52.02 to 58.95) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions. Messi sat there in Zurich, to the left of Ronaldo, and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third Ballon d'Or. Deservedly so, too. Yet Ronaldo's cry of 'Si' lit something under the four-time winner. Hell hath no fury like a Messi scorned, and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world's best in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Since the Ballon d'Or ceremony, there's been no contest. Messi beats Ronaldo on goals (18 to 8), goals per game (1.2 to 0.73), minutes per goal (75 to 122.75), shots (60 to 52), chances created (39 to 17), assists (9 to 3) and minutes-per-goal involvement (50 to 89.27). Messi has been outstanding ever since Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or on January 12 and the stats prove it . The frustration against Levante was written all over Ronaldo's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal . How the top of La Liga stands ahead of El Clasico . It's unrecognisable. A complete reversal. To the overall statistics in all competitions this season, it puts Messi ahead in the three major categories: goals (43 to 41), assists (21 to 15) and, comfortably, chances created (112 to 68). Down to the brass tacks of La Liga, too. There was a moment on November 22, when Ronaldo had 20 goals to Messi's seven.\u00a0Yet today, Ronaldo has 30 to Messi's 32. All this has reopened the debate between Messi and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in Europe last Tuesday. Ronaldo is congratulated by FIFA president Sepp Blatter during the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich . Ronaldo cry of 'Si' lit something under four-time winner Messi, who has obliterated his form ever since . Ronaldo must up his game to stay in competition with Messi if he is to retain the Ballon d'Or next year . Ronaldo, for a man that had broken the Champions League goalscoring record, left the pitch shaking his head following a 4-3 defeat by Schalke at the Bernabeu. Those all-too-familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team's direction, and the Spanish whistles were piercing. 'I won't talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo announced afterwards, as frustrated as any, while a poll by Spanish newspaper AS found 32.2 per cent voted for Cristiano to be dropped. All is not right in Ronaldo's world, and he has been putting in additional work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas. Messi, meanwhile, warmed up for El Clasico by putting on a masterclass for Manchester City at the Nou Camp. Ronaldo has been putting in extra work this week at the\u00a0Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas . Ronaldo has been at the training ground preparing hard for the trip to Barcelona's Nou Camp on Sunday . Guardiola wasn't the only one mesmerised. Just look at the feedback: . The kid from next door in Barcelona, with the ability to glue the ball to his foot, has been swaying a few votes in his favour, it seems. Yet on Sunday at 8pm, another chapter of Messi vs Ronaldo \u2013 a rivalry that demands its own Wikipedia page \u2013 will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million. Messi received plenty of  feedback from the world of football and beyond for his performance against City . Messi delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the City defence ragged at the Nou Camp . The table below shows how the attacking trios of Barcelona (Messi, Neymar and Suarez) and Real Madrid (Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale) compare in all competitions. Green indicates the player that comes out on top in that category, such as Messi for goals, while those in red shows them as the worst of the six, such as Neymar for assists.",

        "article": "A ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten at a Tampa zoo just melted everyone's hearts by relaxing and just being cute as he was washed under a water faucet. The endangered kitten, who has not yet been named and is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo, has just began to open his eyes and hasn't even taken his first step. And when zoo staff members wash him in the sink and feed him with a bottle, he's as cute as ever. The ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten, who has yet to be named, is being fed and watched over by staff at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida . Staff members said he has barely opened his eyes, has yet to walk and will be watched 'round-the-clock' for the next few months . The kitten is given 'round-the-clock' care where he'll be fed and watched after for about three months by staff, according toFOX Tampa Bay. He is expected to start walking in about two weeks, and zoo staff will determine his future home in the next few weeks. Four-year-old clouded leopards Yim and Malee were paired as potential mates in 2011, when they arrived at the zoo, by the Clouded Leopard Species Survival Plan, which supports the conservation of the endangered animal. They then conceived their first born - the kitten who was born this month. Vice President of animal science and conservation at the zoo Dr Larry Killmar said the birth 'signifies a milestone accomplishment' for the conservation programs. 'Species survival programs for animals like the clouded leopards take years of planning, development and staff commitment. The kitten will contribute to the long-term viability of our conservation efforts within the managed population,' Killmar told FOX. The kitten is expected to start walking in a couple weeks. He is the baby of two four-year-old clouded leopards at the zoo who were matched as potential mates in 2011 by a conservation group . The clouded leopard is an endangered species and it is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all new born kittens . Clouded leopards are the smallest of the 'big cats', weighing between 30 and 50lb when fully grown. The cat - the most talented climbers among the cats - is classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and its total population is no more than 10,000. This is down to factors such as deforestation, illegal trading and poaching commercially. Some parts, such as claws, skin and teeth are also consumed for decoration purposes. As such, it is important to do as much as possible to ensure the health and well-being of the threatened animal. It is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all newborn clouded leopards. The cat is most commonly found in the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China.",

        "article": "A blind sled dog named Gonzo is never far from his brother Poncho, who for years has acted as his sight on the trails in New Hampshire. Now that the Alaskan husky brothers are nearing age 10, NH Sled Dog Rescue is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family. Both Gonzo and Poncho were born with sight but in 2010, trainers started to realize Gonzo was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food. Inseparable: Blind sled dog Gonzo (left) is currently up for adoption with his brother Poncho (right), who has been acting as his sight on the trails for years. Both are currently up for adoption, and their rescue center hopes to find them a home where they can live together . When his blindness was initially diagnosed, a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team, and that's when Poncho stepped up to the plate. 'At first it kind of upset him (Poncho) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because Gonzo was leaning up against him,' musher Wes Guerin told WMUR. 'Over time, Poncho kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail. He started to help him. If there was a left turn coming up or a right turn, he'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he (Gonzo) didn't run off the trail or anything like that,' Guerin said. On the off occasion that Gonzo has run off the trail, Poncho has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar. A dog's seeing eye dog: Gonzo's sight first started failing in 2010, but his brother Poncho stepped in and helped direct him on sled dog runs. Poncho (left) and Gonzo (right) pictured above in 2013 . Runners: For years the brothers ran with Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel in Jefferson, New Hampshire giving tours in the winter months . 'I've run dogs in a lot of places, all over the country, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen sled dogs do,' musher Neil Beaulieu told the Associated Press in 2013. While the reliance on Poncho worked for several years, Gonzo eventually had to quit sled running this fall, when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight. Since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no-kill shelter. Retirement-ready dogs at\u00a0NH Sled Dog Rescue\u00a0can be adopted for a fee of $250, part of which goes to supporting the shelter. This year they have about 40 dogs up for sale at their Jefferson, New Hampshire facility. Alaskan huskies can live to age 16.",

        "article": "A member of the royal family was involved in a suspected paedophile ring, an ex-policeman has claimed. But investigations into the allegations were 'shut down for national security reasons', the former Metropolitan police officer said. The officer said he was told by fellow officers that both a royal and an MP had both been identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the late 1980s. A member of the royal family was involved in a suspected paedophile ring, an ex-policeman has claimed. But investigations into the allegations were 'shut down for national security reasons', the former Metropolitan police officer said (stock picture) He\u00a0told the Sunday Mirror how a detective sergeant from Marylebone police station in London - who also named actor Oliver Reed in separate claims - revealed the investigation had been pulled for national security reasons. The source said: 'I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed. 'The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP. 'He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public's interest because it \"could destabilise national security\".' The former Metropolitan Police officer said he was told by fellow officers that both a royal and an MP had both been identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the late 1980s . Sir Allan Green, Director of Public Prosecutions,  told the Sunday Mirror he he was not aware of any paedophile investigations shut down for national security reasons. He added that he'd been asked if he knew anything about an MP being involved in child abuse but he hadn't. The information has since been passed on to police. The news comes after it was revealed that\u00a0Scotland Yard has been accused of facilitating 14 cover-ups of VIP child sex abuse. Dossier: Labour MP John Mann (pictured) last year submitted an explosive dossier to police naming 22 politicians linked to historical child abuse . Over 35 years, officers are said to have protected \u2018untouchable\u2019 figures by shutting down inquiries that reached the heart of government. The 14 alleged cover-ups were referred to watchdogs by the Metropolitan Police Service itself yesterday. It threatens to be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s. The allegations were uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. Those on the inquiry, known as Operation Fairbank, are understood to have raised concerns after studying files kept in storage. The claims include one that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused. Victims claim that high-profile politicians, diplomats and civil servants visited the property to abuse boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys. Police are also accused of failing to end sex parties at the now notorious Dolphin Square complex, in Pimlico, central London, following the intervention of \u2018prominent people\u2019. It is claimed that members of a wealthy and powerful elite believed they were \u2018untouchable\u2019 after police were warned off shutting down the sordid activities. One senior figure under the spotlight is former Tory home secretary William Whitelaw, who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring. The politician, one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s closest allies, is suspected of quashing a year-long investigation into a gang accused of abusing 40 children. Other inquiries focus on claims that the names of high-profile sex attackers were removed from witness statements and that police deliberately let senior politicians off the hook. One inquiry is examining allegations that Special Branch seized a dossier naming 16 MPs and peers handed to an investigative journalist by a former Labour minister. Paedophile: A detective says he was ordered to cover up Cyril Smith's crimes by senior colleagues . Unbelievably, two undercover officers are themselves suspected of sexually abusing a boy during a raid at the Elm Guest House. The IPCC is still considering two further cases, including the shadowy murder of eight-year-old Vishal Mehrotra in July 1981. His family believes he may have fallen into the hands of members of the VIP sex ring and evidence leading to their door was deliberately ignored. Sarah Green, of the IPCC, said police and her officials were examining claims that evidence was suppressed, investigations were hindered and halted and offences covered up. \u2018These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature,\u2019 she said. \u2018Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.\u2019 Defending the decision to \u2018manage\u2019 the Met inquiry, rather than undertake an independent one, she said: \u2018The new criminal investigations looking at alleged police corruption are closely linked and well under way.\u2019 Mrs Green said this decision remained under review and could be changed if new evidence came to light. Responding to the inquiries, Mr Watson said many child abuse victims will have mixed feelings but will be pleased that their voices are now being heard.",

He has built an impressive art collection over a decades-long career as Britain\u2019s most-feared critic. But now Brian Sewell has revealed that some of the works he has accumulated have gone missing \u2013 stolen by once-trusted friends. \u2018It is surprising how unpleasant people can be,\u2019 he tells Event magazine today. \u2018How untrustworthy friends can become. \u2018How somebody you think you can absolutely depend on will do something so mean that it astonishes you.\u2019 None of Mr Sewell\u2019s light-fingered visitors are likely to face justice since he has decided to not report the matter to police. The critic, who is suffering from cancer, refuses to identify those he holds responsible for betraying him but makes it abundantly clear that he knows who they are. The thefts have occurred over the past ten years and came to light recently when he started sorting through his belongings, bagging up old clothes for charity and consigning other unwanted items to the bonfire. Friends and acquaintances visiting his home in Wimbledon, South London, have made off with paintings and drawings, he says, and, when challenged, have denied all knowledge. However, Sewell has confessed that he occasionally indulged in similar behaviour himself when visiting friends\u2019 homes \u2013 though on a much smaller scale. He said: \u2018I have stolen the odd book myself. I have a theory that only men steal books, although when I proposed that to a woman a month or two ago she was absolutely outraged. \u2018It\u2019s not really books I\u2019m worrying about \u2013 it\u2019s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear. You don\u2019t know when they disappear but, when you think about it, it\u2019s only... when people have been to the house. \u2018This is betrayal. It makes me so angry and helpless because you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019 Sewell, whose trenchant views once led to leading figures in the art world demanding his dismissal as the Evening Standard\u2019s art critic, also speaks \u2013with some reluctance \u2013 about his illness. 'I have stolen the odd book myself,' the critic said. 'It\u2019s not really books I\u2019m worrying about \u2013 it\u2019s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear. It\u2019s only... when people have been to the house' \u2018I think a serene death with my dogs on the bed would be wonderful,\u2019 he said. \u2018It may still happen. I really don\u2019t know.\u2019 The 84-year-old has admitted to disliking children but loving animals \u2013 ironically as his latest book is aimed at youngsters. The White Umbrella, which has just been published, is about a wounded donkey found by a TV crew visiting Pakistan \u2013 and he says he wrote it as a \u2018distraction\u2019 from his radiotherapy. Last night he said he had confronted the \u2018friends\u2019 he suspected of robbing him but had failed to get any of the missing artworks back. \u2018I have always done it face-to-face and I now know it isn\u2019t worth doing because it simply gets worse \u2013 the lies don\u2019t help.\u2019",

        "article": "Federal prosecutors could file corruption charges against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez by the end of the week, ending a years-long saga that has had the Democratic politician livign and working under a shadow of criminal suspicion. The Wall Street Journal reported that the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would see charges filed in his native New Jersey, citing people familiar with the FBI's investigation. The allegations against Menendez involve claims that he used his office to promote the business interests of a Democratic Party donor and close friend in exchange for personal gifts. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing, vowing that he is 'not going anywhere.' But a grand jury probe that has lasted for two years coudl complicate his future. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran, leading some Republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the White House is exacting retribution on him. But more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about Menendez's relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. But his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement earlier this month that 'we believe all of the Senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.' 'Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.' 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other\u2019s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' COY: Attorney General Eric Holder wouldn't talk on Friday about whether charges are forthcoming for Menendez, saying 'I can't comment' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' CNN reported that the investigation into Menendez is reaching a crescendo, with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges. Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the\u00a0New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez\u2019s re-election campaign. The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the presdient's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment \u2013 principally cargo-container x-ray machines \u2013 to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.",

        "article": "Puppy killer Nathan Thompson has spoken out after his court hearing claiming he is a dog lover. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty and as a result, has been banned from owning, acquiring, buying or possessing any animal for a decade. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy said it was definitely one of the worst animal cruelty incidents he has seen in his career. 'This is a far more significant situation where there is an element of pre-planning and a deliberate attack on the animals,' he said. Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph.. Scroll down for video . Thompson (pictured) leaves\u00a0East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon and bashed a number of them to death with a rock. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, told Daily Mail Australia on Friday he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused\u00a0of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr\u00a0O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable and has improved significantly despite serious head injuries. The clinic has received offers to re-home the puppy, however they are choosing to focus on the puppy's recovery and not get ahead of themselves.

        "article": "Fernando Alonso has expressed natural disappointment he is to sit out the season-opening Formula One grand prix in Australia, but is fully appreciative of the circumstances. On advice from doctors Alonso will have to wait for his competitive return with McLaren until the second race in Malaysia later this month. Although given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in a heavy crash in the second pre-season test in Barcelona on February 22, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' has forced Alonso's hand. Fernando Alonso was involved in a high-speed crash during testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya . Alonso's McLaren is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck after crashing in Barcelona . McLaren driver Alonso was taken by helicopter to hospital following the accident in Catalonia . Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, Alonso said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' \u00a3countdownMalaysia.' For the Albert Park event Alonso's seat will now be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' The 22-year-old Danish racer Kevin Magnussen will replace Alonso for McLaren at the Australian Grand Prix . To which a sporting Alonso replied: 'best of luck at the race mate! \u00a3BelieveInMcLarenHonda.' Explaining the circumstances behind the decision taken to withdraw Alonso from Australia, McLaren have revealed doctors found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. But given the prospect of second-impact syndrome Alonso was 'advised he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting'. A McLaren statement added: 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice. Fernando's doctors acknowledge he feels fit and well, and he regards himself as ready to race. Medical staff arrived on the scene to give Alonso treatment at the side of the road after the accident . A helicopter was sent to pick up Alonso and taken him to hospital from Barcelona's\u00a0Circuit de Catalunya . Alonso was taken to hospital by helicopter after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph . 'That being the case they are comfortable with the fact he has already recommenced physical training, with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his McLaren-Honda car for the Malaysian Grand Prix meeting on March 27, 28 and 29. 'Indeed, his doctors are supportive of that ambition, satisfied as they are that he sustained no damage whatsoever during his testing accident on February 22. 'All at McLaren-Honda fully support Fernando's decision in respect of his doctors' advice.' Double world champion Alonso has returned to McLaren for this season after spending the past five years with Ferrari, burying the hatchet with Group CEO Ron Dennis following an ignominious campaign with the team in 2007.",

Peter McKay, 35, had been living with Leslie Bidgood for around six months in Sheppey, Kent, when he savagely attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner. Both men had been drinking vodka and McKay was also taking sedatives when he struck his friend of four years with the meat cleaver, causing injuries to his head and neck and leaving him 'lucky to be alive'. Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard\u00a0Peter McKay had been living with Leslie Bidgood for around six months in Sheppey, Kent, when he attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner . Mr Bidgood, who was watching television when the attack took place on September 18 last year, managed to run from the flat covered in blood. But he was pursued by McKay, who held him up against a fence and shouted: 'What's my name?' before punching him in the head. McKay also threatened witnesses who tried to help the victim. The men had previously downed several vodka red bulls each and McKay was also taking sedative tablets. Maidstone Crown Court heard McKay emerged from the kitchen 'growling' before attacking Mr Bidgood. Mark Mullins, prosecuting, said: 'He went up to Mr Bidgood and started hitting him around the neck and head. 'Mr Bidgood saw blood on his hands. He felt it dripping down from his face.' 'He tried to push him away. He said: \"We are mates. We are both on the same side\". Mr McKay didn't stop. He just kept growling.' McKay had been preparing a spaghetti bolognese for their dinner when he turned on his flatmate . 'The victim could not remember anything else until he woke up in hospital with cuts to his neck, behind his left ear and above his left eye, which needed stitches.' Mr Mullins told the jury the 'very nasty attack' could have had much more serious consequences. McKay claimed he was intoxicated due to the consumption of the tablets and alcohol which led to a state of 'automatism'. But Mr Mullins said: 'The prosecution say it was a voluntary act on his part. 'This is not a case of someone who suddenly lost their inhibitions and didn't know what he was doing. 'When he stabbed him he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm. Someone who stabs someone multiple times with a meat cleaver intends to do someone really serious harm.' Giving evidence Mr Bidgood told the court he got on well with McKay, there were no issues between the pair and they would often enjoy watching television and playing video games together. He said: 'Even on medication, he was always happy. 'We were together all day. We went to the shop to get some drink and some mince for spaghetti bolognese. 'I don't remember how much we had to drink before we went. I think I had a couple of vodkas and Red Bull. When we got back I went onto my tablet and played a game. 'He did the same. We had a chat and a laugh. I don't know how much we had to drink. He was pouring them. I would say a fair bit. I am not really a drinker. 'He was in the kitchen preparing dinner. I could hear him cutting up onion. He was popping in and out and chatting. There was nothing to indicate all was not well with his mind. 'I remember him coming in and saying \"It's all your fault\". 'I tried to calm him down and told him we are mates. He was holding a meat cleaver. 'I got up and said: \"What's going on\". I just don't remember much. It is blurred. I don't remember being attacked, but I know I was. 'All I know is I wanted to get out of the flat. I don't remember going downstairs. I know I felt it. I don't remember him hitting me. I just came round at the hospital.' Mr Bidford needed three stitches by his Adam's apple, seven on the side of his head and butterfly stitches on his eye. 'They have all healed up,' he added. 'There is a little scar.' McKay denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court and will be sentenced on April 27. Detective Constable Mark Silk from Kent Police said: 'There is no doubt a substantial amount of alcohol, combined with a number of sedative pills proved to be a potent cocktail and played a part in McKay's state of mind that night. 'However, that should in no way be used as an excuse. He was fully conscious and had in his possession a lethal weapon and using it meant he fully intended to cause harm. 'It must have been a terrifying shock and ordeal to have seen someone change in that way and see them attacking you. 'In fact, the victim was incredibly lucky the attack was not fatal. 'I am pleased the jury were able to see the seriousness of the offence and convict him on the comprehensive evidence put before them.'",

Pichette, 52, shared the decision, which he called a 'perfectly fine mid life crisis full of bliss and beauty', in a Google+ post\u00a0on  Tuesday afternoon. 'After nearly 7 years as CFO, I will be retiring from Google to spend more time with my family,' he wrote - adding that he will only be leaving the company once they find a replacement. Canadian-born Pichette explained that the idea of retiring first came to him last September while he was watching the sunrise from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife, Tamar. Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Patrick Pichette, Google's\u00a0chief financial officer (pictured in 2012), has announced he is retiring after nearly seven years working for the company. He plans to travel the world with his wife, he said . 'And Tamar out of the blue said \"Hey, why don't we just keep on going\",' he wrote. '\"Let's explore Africa, and then turn east to make our way to India, it's just next door, and we're here already. '\"Then, we keep going; the Himalayas, Everest, go to Bali, the Great Barrier Reef... Antarctica, let's go see Antarctica!?\"' He told her: 'It's not time yet, There is still so much to do at Google, with my career, so many people counting on me/us - Boards, Non Profits, etc,' he wrote. 'But then she asked the killer question: So when is it going to be time? Our time? My time? The questions just hung there in the cold morning African air. 'A few weeks later, I was happy back at work, but could not shake away THE question: When is it time for us to just keep going?' He explained that this is the right time to step down, as two of their children are away at college and the third is working for a start-up in Africa. Family: Pichette said it is time to retire because his three children are no longer living at home. He will also celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife (center) this year and said 'she deserves more' Turning point: He first thought of retiring as he and his wife watched the sunset from Mount Kilimanjaro last year (pictured with their guides) and she said she wanted to keep traveling with him rather than go home . 'Nobody is waiting for us/needing us,' he wrote. The couple will also celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary this year. In that entire time, it has been 'non-stop work' for him.\u00a0'She deserves more,' he wrote. 'Lots more.' Pichette explained that he would be staying with Google, where it has been a 'privilege' to work, until the company finds a replacement and he will be remain there throughout the transition. He concluded: 'In the end, life is wonderful, but nonetheless a series of trade offs, especially between business/professional endeavours and family/community. 'And thankfully, I feel I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have to have to make such tough choices anymore. And for that I am truly grateful. Carpe Diem.' Pichette can afford to step down.\u00a0Bloomberg Business reported that his salary is $650,000. In 2012,\u00a0he was paid a $492,115 salary and a $2.7 million cash bonus,\u00a0CNN Money\u00a0reported. And in addition to his salary and bonuses, he earned in nearly $31 million from his Google stock incentives from 2010 to 2013, the Associated Press reported. Adventurer: Pichette, who earned $31 million from his Google stock incentives alone between 2010 and 2013, said he is no longer in the position where he has to choose between working and his family . Since Pichette joined the company in 2008, the share price has more than doubled and Google has made some of its biggest acquisitions, including\u00a0Motorola's wireless business, which it bought for $9.8 billion,\u00a0Bloomberg reported. He told the company he would be retiring on March 4 and it plans to find a new CFO within the next six months, Google said in a statement. CEO Larry Page also shared Pichette's leaving notice on his own Google+ page. 'Well worth reading -- it will warm your heart,' he wrote. 'Patrick has been a joy to work with and I wish him all the best on his new adventures!' Pichette was born in Montreal, attended the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and received an MA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford. He worked for Bell Canada before Google. Property records show he lives with his wife in a $4 million, five-bedroom home in Palo Alto, California, just a few miles from Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Announcement: Pichette wrote a lengthy post on his Google+ account explaining his decision on Tuesday .",

        "article": "It is a common problem for airlines, ferries and cruise ships - how do you make\u00a0passengers\u00a0pay attention to the\u00a0safety briefing? Condor Ferries believes it has found the solution, producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention. Doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings, the Portsmouth-based company said it wanted to inject some 'fun' into this year's offering. But not everybody is a fan, with some\u00a0commentators\u00a0saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the\u00a0song. The captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration . Condor Ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their 'Good Times' branding . Slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves, the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on YouTube several days ago. The video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces: 'To ensure you have good times on board, please listen up to the following safety message from Condor Ferries.' It's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing, 'life jackets, life jackets, they're right beneath your seat.' The pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket. 'It clips together so easily just listen for the click,' sings the female. 'That means you've done it properly and you look so very hip.' That may be a matter of opinion. The steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle, all out of sync . All you have to do is just 'listen for the click' says the stewardess, and that means you've done it right . The male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are, complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals. But it only gets worse. It's back to the captain, as he comes into shot singing 'now ladies, hey ladies,' while making what can only be described as an 'uncomfortable' facial expression. However, rather than flirting, he is simply advising that 'sharp objects can't go on our slides, so leave those heels behind.' The steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits . The emergency slide is then shown, at least in graphic form, as the stewardess demonstrates how, well, to slide down it. The video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage, to using a resuscitator and defibrillator, as 'you name it, we have it.' The star of the show then comes back, the captain, as he sings: 'So who would have thought that the Condor could bust out such good rhymes?' The video is being broadcast  on all sailings between Poole and the Channel Islands. He's back! The captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides . The idea was conceived and produced by Bournemouth-based Walker Agency, working closely with the Condor Ferries safety, marine operations and marketing teams. Alicia Andrews, executive director \u2013 commercial at Condor Ferries, said: 'We're really proud of the new safety video, it's been a very fun project to work on, and we're delighted with the results. 'Our brief was simple, we wanted something a little bit different, something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of, and which would appeal to all members of the family. We think that the rap, with the Good Times messaging does just that. The stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide... not too difficult . 'Ferry travel is very family-friendly, there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring \u2013 you can pack everything in to your car, and off you go. 'We hope that our passengers, whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their Good Times experience onboard Condor Liberation as we set sail to Jersey and Guernsey.' However the video has been met with less-than positive comments by users on YouTube, where it has been hosted. The staff are there to help with passengers' every need, according to the safety video . Liam Gilheany wrote: 'I want to pour lava into my ears,' while James Lund added: 'I'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real.' Nathan Thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing: 'I hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain.' Condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap. The release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state-of-the-art Condor Liberation with a new mission statement of 'Good Times.' The video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at Condor Ferries .",

His promotion and the appointment of two non-executive independent directors in Claudia Arney and Kevin Beeston, as revealed by Sports Agenda, was finally rubberstamped at Thursday\u2019s club summit. The three-strong board will meet monthly to ensure proper scrutiny of Scudamore\u2019s increased powerbase, with the newcomers also attending the PL\u2019s club summits six times a year. Richard Scudamore was elevated to the role of Premier League executive chairman on Thursday . Scudamore, who has recovered from serious heart surgery last summer, said: \u2018This is almost a re-commitment. This isn\u2019t something you would do if you were about to leave. \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m up for it and my health is absolutely fine. This is a very enjoyable job. My enthusiasm for it has never waned.\u2019 Arney, an Arsenal season ticket-holder, is a non-executive director of Halfords. She used to work at Goldman Sachs and the Treasury. Beeston is chairman of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey. He was a board member of Ipswich during their financial troubles and is a Chelsea season ticket-holder. Oddly, the Premier League say he enjoys watching rugby and tennis. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves vows an inquiry if England don't beat West Indies in their Test series . Colin Graves, the incoming chairman of the ECB, has already stated he expects England to beat a \u2018mediocre\u2019 West Indies side in the Caribbean next month. And Graves will be in Barbados for the last of the three Tests, when head coach Peter Moores and England managing director Paul Downton will surely have to be shown the door if a series defeat follows the World Cup debacle. Barclays will definitely not be renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier League when their \u00a340million-a-year contract expires at the end of next season, clubs were told on Thursday. The PL will not be short of offers, even at a higher price, to endorse the world\u2019s richest league, with Guinness said to be interested. Barclays first raised doubts about their deal at the start of 2014, when a senior executive was alleged to have said the sponsorship had \u2018zero value\u2019 in the UK. On top of that, group chief executive Antony Jenkins doesn\u2019t like football. Barclays have sponsored the Premier League since 2001 but the 2015-16 season is set to be their last . It will not help promoter Barry McGuigan\u2019s negotiations with ITV over Carl Frampton\u2019s next fight that foreign exchange traders CWMFX, who heavily sponsored his first super-bantamweight world title defence on the network, have had their London offices raided by police. Thirteen people were arrested on suspicion of fraud. ITV declined to comment. The Webb Ellis trophy will be contested for at the home World Cup, which begins in September . Around 350,000 World Cup tickets being returned by the International Rugby Board to ER2015 are not expected to include many for England matches at Twickenham. This is much to the annoyance of the official England Rugby Supporters Club. They are upset at the number of Twickenham tickets that have gone to official hospitality, especially after being told they had priority status for World Cup matches \u2014 apart from England at Twickenham. ER2015 say they will have a \u2018few thousand\u2019 extra England tickets to put on sale, while corporate hospitality were given 21,000 tickets for England group games at HQ. FA chairman Greg Dyke is adamant more homegrown players need to play in Football League sides . Premier League clubs and FA chairman Greg Dyke had a remarkably civil encounter on Thursday considering their conflicting positions on Dyke\u2019s campaign for more homegrown players. It was agreed there would be consultation on the issue after a club asked Dyke whether he would force through changes. The FA and Milltown Partners, their PR advisers, had been very bullish about making it happen after Dyke announced his campaign last Monday, but the FA chairman rode back on Thursday, telling clubs he only wanted debate. England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster has just been told by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie that four runners-up finishes in the Six Nations is \u2018unacceptable\u2019. So it\u2019s not the best week for the Leaders in Sport website to be promoting a video about Lancaster \u2018creating a winning formula for one of the most physical sports in the world\u2019. Not yet he hasn\u2019t.",

From the glittering lights over the English Channel to the sand dunes in Oman and the concrete nature of New York, the world's varied landmarks have been recorded from on board the orbiting craft. Scroll down for video . The Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter', is the second largest sand desert in the world. It has distinctive dune formations and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen . The current Expedition 42 crew on ISS has created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on Earth.\u00a0One of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January (pictured). It shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows . All of these images form part of the Nasa: Landscapes by Samantha Cristoforetti collection. Ms Cristoforetti is one of six astronauts on board the station as part of Expedition 42. Her colleagues include commander Barry Wilmore, flight engineer Terry Virts and Russian cosmonauts Elena Serova, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov. The expedition began on 9 November last year, when Expedition 41 undocked and they are due to return in May. One of the most striking images in the collection shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January. It shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance, on the curvature of the Earth, a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows. A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes . The expedition also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean. In particular, the midtown areas of Manhattan are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black. Larger, more open spaces of airports including John F Kennedy can just be distinguished . The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station. The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft \u2018slow\u2019 the speed of the station. This changed the height of its orbit  by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position. A second image was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen towards the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes. It doesn't erupt as frequently Kilauea, but when it does eruptions produce rivers of lava that have threatened the nearby town of Hilo. It rises almost 5.5 miles (9km)  and almost 90 per cent of its surface is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old. From the relatively remote island of Hawaii, the expedition has also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of New York City. The grey, concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean. Further west, Ms Cristoferetti captured this image above Yosemite National Park in California. The snow-topped mountains in the region, including Mount Dana, Mount Lyell and Mount Warren are shown. The small lake in the bottom of the picture is called Mono Lake with Paoha Island in the centre. The park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles (3,081 square kilometres) During its orbit over Africa, the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique (pictured).\u00a0The coastline is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala, and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km) David MacLean from the GIS FacultyCentre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), told MailOnline this image of Earth shows the Bahamas, in particular Long, Acklins and Crooked Islands, Cuba to the left and Florida to the right of centre .

The park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles (3,081 square kilometres). During its orbit over Africa and heading across the Middle East and into Asia the crew captured the coastline of Mozambique, Kazakhstan and Tamgaly, and Pakistan. The coastline of Mozambique is rocky and jagged, especially near Baia De Sofala and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles (6,942 km). Elsewhere in Africa, Lake Kariba between Zambia and Zimbabwe is shown, photographed from almost 250 miles (400km) in orbit around the Earth. It is the world's largest manmade lake and reservoir and was filled in the early 1960s after the Kariba Dam was completed. Tamgaly is a petroglyph site in the Semirechye, Kazakhstan, around 74 miles (120km) to northwest of Almaty. The majority of the 5,000 petroglyphs are in the main canyon and are mostly from the Bronze Age. The name Tamgaly in Kazakh means 'painted or marked place' and the region became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004. Over Pakistan, Ms Cristoferrti photographed the Indus River Delta - an area of the South Asian country where Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. On either side of the delta are Keti Bunder South Wildlife Sanctuary and Marho Kotri Wildlife Sanctuary and the dry arid region receives between 10 and 19 inches (25 and 50cm) of rainfall a year. The delta is home to mangrove forests as well as  the Indus Dolphin. The crew also captured distinctive dune formations of the Rub' al Khali, also known as the 'Empty Quarter. It is the second largest sand desert in the world and covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometres) including regions of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

The International Space Station marked its 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 November 2010 and since Expedition 1 in 2000 the space station has been visited by more than 215 people. As of November 2014, there have been 100 Russian launches,\u00a037 space shuttle launches, one test flight and three operational flights by SpaceX\u2019s Dragon as well as a test flight and two operational flights by Orbital Science\u2019s Cygnus. A total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours, or approximately 48 days. The space station, including its large solar arrays, spans the area of a U.S. football field, including the end zones, and weighs 924,739 pounds. The complex now has more livable room than a conventional six-bedroom house, and has two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a 360-degree bay window.",

The infamous \u2018sex-in-a-motel claim\u2019 rumbled on for six years after the woman suffered cuts to her nose and mouth as well as \u2018psychological injuries\u2019. This all came about when a glass light fitting was pulled from the wall of the motel room as she had \u2018vigorous\u2019 sex with a local man in Nowra in November 2007. Public Service Minister Eric Abetz is making changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on \u2018rorting and malingering' Public Service Minister Eric Abetz revealed the cost of the claim as he engineered changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on \u2018rorting and malingering\u2019, by Commonwealth bureaucrats. The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000, including the costs of the bureaucrat's own lawyers and barristers. \u2018The flaws in the system were highlighted in lurid terms by the infamous \"hotel room sex case\", where a Commonwealth public servant successfully sought workers compensation for an injury sustained on a work trip, after hours, while engaging in sexual activity,\u2019 the minister says in\u00a0The Canberra Times. The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000 . \u2018Thankfully the decision was ultimately overturned by the High Court, but at significant cost to the scheme, which had to pay more than $600,000 in legal costs to defend the spurious claim, including for the legal costs of the libidinous claimant.\u2019 Legislation introduced to the Parliament on Wednesday can save federal government agencies up to $50 million in their insurance premiums each year by making sweeping reforms to the much-maligned public service compensation scheme. Senator Abetz said that, rather than paying them to stay at home, his reforms would help turn Comcare into an insurer that helped get injured public servants back to work.",

        "article": "(CNN)The first state visit to the United States of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah was supposed to take place in early March. But the visit was delayed because Republican leaders had invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress during the same time period. According to two Afghan government officials involved in the planning for the visit, the Afghan government believed American media attention would be largely focused on Netanyahu, so the first U.S. visit of the new Afghan president was delayed by two weeks, which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders shouldn't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders. Ghani and Abdullah arrived in Washington on Sunday and have had much to discuss with the Obama administration. For the Afghan government, the timetable of President Barack Obama's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue. Obama says that the last American troops will leave Afghanistan at the end of 2016. This happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down America's post-9/11 wars. Ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this U.S. troop withdrawal, telling CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in January, \"deadlines should not be dogmas\" and that there should be a \"willingness to reexamine\" the withdrawal date. Is Obama's withdrawal plan a wise policy? Short answer: Of course not. One only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an Afghanistan without some kind of residual American presence. Without American forces in the country, there is a strong possibility Afghanistan could host a reinvigorated Taliban allied to a reinvigorated al Qaeda, not to mention ISIS, which is gaining a foothold in the region. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for Afghanistan. But it would also be quite damaging to U.S. interests to have some kind of resurgent al Qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks. It would also be disastrous for the Democratic Party, should it win the presidency in 2016, to be the party that \"lost\" Afghanistan. After all, the Democratic Party is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the Republicans and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual American presence in Afghanistan, al Qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the Afghan-Pakistan border region against American interests somewhere in the world. On Tuesday, President Obama announced that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015. But this welcome development does not change the central issue, which is the Obama administration's withdrawal date of December 2016 for all U.S. forces. Merely because the Obama administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 doesn't mean that suddenly at the same time that the Taliban will lay down their arms, nor that the Afghan army will be able to fight the Taliban completely unaided. Nor does it mean that al Qaeda -- and ISIS, which is beginning to establish small cells in Afghanistan -- would cease to be a threat. An easy way for potential Democratic presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to distinguish their national security policies from Obama's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an Iraq-style outcome. Similarly, as the Republican Party starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign, potential candidates such as Jeb Bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist Rand Paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long-term presence in Afghanistan. This U.S. military presence in Afghanistan doesn't have to be a large, nor does it need to play a combat role, but U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan to advise the Afghan army and provide intelligence support. Such a long-term commitment of several thousand American troops is exactly the kind of force that the Obama administration was forced to deploy to Iraq following ISIS's lightning advances there over the past year. Selling a longer-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation's government. Consider that within 24 hours of being installed, the new Afghan government led by Ghani and Abdullah signed the basing agreement that allows American troops to stay in Afghanistan until December 2016. Consider also that the Afghan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the United States lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term U.S. military presence. Consider also that many Afghans see a relatively small, but long-term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability. It is also not in Pakistan's interests for Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban or be thrust into another civil war. The Pakistanis have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the Taliban to flourish on their own soil, most recently in the Taliban attack in December on the army school in Peshawar that killed 132 children. It is in Pakistan's own interest that the Afghan army is able to fight effectively against the Taliban, which is more likely if they continue to have American advisers at their side. Other regional powers such as the Chinese worry about Chinese Uighur separatists establishing themselves on Afghan soil. The Russians are similarly worried about Islamist terrorist groups located in Afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country. Keeping a relatively small, predominantly U.S. Special Forces, presence in Afghanistan to continue to train the Afghan army past December 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both Afghans and Americans. Both the Democratic and Republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign. And Obama should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next President.",

        "article": "(CNN)With majorities in both chambers of Congress, it is time for Republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed Obama administration policies. Our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the Obama administration. Regrettably, military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism. A strong, robust defense is seen not to deter aggression, but to provoke it. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt: our entitlement programs. As expected, almost four years after the passage of the Budget Control Act, virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs, while essential defense programs have been sacrificed. Political leaders in Washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government. Instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels, the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us, listing the programs and capabilities we'll need to protect our people and interests around the world, and then funding those efforts. Even though we've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade, the threats to Americans at home and abroad are growing.  From the rise of the Islamic State and the spread of Islamic terrorism, to Russia's aggression in Europe, to Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, the threats to American security are growing. Yet, even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty, the United States has been steadily reducing our spending on defense. Even before sequestration, President Obama made defense cuts of $487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs. This was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration, which, when combined with Obama's prior cuts, will total $1 trillion over the coming decade. All of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership. The results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies. The slight increase in President Obama's proposed 2016 budget won't significantly change that. At the end of this process, our military will be significantly smaller, dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place. The Army is on the path to be reduced to pre-World War II levels. The Navy is at pre-WWI levels. And our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. Our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies. They have presented not just a crisis of readiness for America, but also a perilous strategic weakness. Our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence. History has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend, it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability, and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize. We think we are saving money, but in the long run, we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty. We can afford the military we need, but we must make it a priority. For this reason, we introduced an amendment to the Senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces. We believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by (former) Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his FY12 budget, the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats. It is the budget that the bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel stated was \"the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing.\" Now that Republicans control both house of Congress, it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live, not the world the way we wish it was. Until now, our approach as a country and a party since the Budget Control Act has not been one of American strength. Continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness. We need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform.  In the end, it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade. As members of Congress, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions. Despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military, they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain. It's time that we hold up ours.",

        "article": "A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter told his daughter not to take the contractive pill because it 'causes breast cancer'. The father, who cannot be named legally, is on trial at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child. He took the stand at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court today and recounted the day of the Islamic wedding ceremony at his Hunter Valley home between his child and a 26-year-old Lebanese national on January 12 last year, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man (pictured) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. Now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was' menstruating and interested in boys' a court heard . The man admitted to the court he told his daughter not to take the pill so 'she didn't get breast cancer', and said he had heard about its dangers through the McGrath Foundation. \u201cI say it all the time,\u201d he said. Earlier this week the court heard the father told his daughter Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid'. The girl told a Sydney court her father said Australian law was 'stupid' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse. The girl's interview with a child protection worker was played as part of her father's trial. She said days after her wedding, her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed. 'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under the age of 16. 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse. 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't let him use anything,' she said. 'He always said that - I think the first time was just after we got married.' The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney, she strongly disagreed with the marriage to a 26-year-old man (pictured) The court also heard her 'husband' approached her father about the marriage after he had been refused by leaders at her usual mosque. 'They said no because of my age and because I was Aussie,' she said. 'After he went to sheiks, after a while he came back and asked my Dad.' Her comments come after her mother said she had pleaded with the father to stop the wedding. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney she strongly opposed the marriage. She said her former husband - with whom she had split before the incident - called her on what she believed to be the night of her daughter's wedding. 'He said (my daughter) is going to get married; they wanted to bring the man to meet me,' the mother told the court. 'I said no. I did not want anything to do with (my daughter) getting married.' The woman said she then spoke to her daughter and told her not to get married and the girl said she wouldn't. 'He wanted her to be married or he wouldn't have married her,' she said. 'I didn't agree with it, I had nothing to do with it.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct . The woman's former partner, a 63-year-old man, allegedly married his teen daughter off to a 26-year-old man\u00a0so she did not commit the sin of extramarital sex. The father allegedly gave his daughter's mobile phone number to the 26-year-old man who wanted to marry her and then hosted an Islamic ceremony at his home in the Hunter region. The court heard the mother received a second call from her former partner that night, during which he used his 'angry voice'. 'He said she was going to get married no matter what, that next time I saw her she would be married,' the woman said. 'I just didn't agree with them getting married. 'I know it was him on the other end of the phone; I know his voice because I had to put up with it for 20 years.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct. 'I don't have any trouble remembering the conversations,' she said. 'They did not have my consent. I was not at the wedding. I did not allow it. '(He's) a liar; he is not going to admit to anything. 'What he said is what he said - I didn't add anything or forget anything.' She said she found out they couple had been married under Sharia law when the Department of Community Services got involved after the girl's husband tried to enrol her in a Sydney High school. The mother also told the court she briefly converted to Islam during their relationship, the religion of her husband, because she 'was interested in learning about God, and that was the only one he would let me learn about'. She also lashed out at the father's barrister after it was suggested her memory issues caused by her learning difficulty may have led to her remembering a conversation that never took place. 'Who's going to forget that,' the mother said. 'I'm not happy about my daughter being married in the first place so don't have a go at me.' When Judge Deborah Sweeney attempted to calm her and said the barrister was just doing his job asking questions, the woman asked if the barrister was a Muslim. 'Because if he's Muslim then you got to do what the man says, because the woman is always a liar.' Crown prosecutor \u00adSiobhan Herbert earlier told the court the father hosted the couple at his home, where they allegedly had sex on a specially set up mattress. The father's trial comes after the husband, now 27, was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month\u00a0for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013 after he approached her father and asked to meet her. The girl was pregnant when her 27-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse . 'By her getting married he was stopping the sin of extramarital sex,' Ms Herbert said. 'His actions brought about or caused the unlawful sexual activity.' On the wedding day, he allegedly instructed the girl that neither she nor her partner were allowed to use contraception. On the first weekend after the wedding, the court heard the father hosted the couple at his home where he allegedly arranged a marital bed. The following morning, he asked his daughter if she needed to shower before prayers, in line with Islamic practice after sexual intercourse, the court was told . The father allegedly consented to the wedding, in January 2014, after discovering his daughter had begun menstruating and becoming interested in boys. Judge Deborah Sweeney said \u00a0the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. The  girl was pregnant when her 27-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. However, she miscarried in February after complaining of abdominal pain . The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW,\u00a0in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013 \u00a0after he approached her father and asked to meet her. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The Imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "You begin to believe Tim Sherwood after a night like this. Aston Villa\u2019s first win since December 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season. It was late, it was a little lucky, but it was deserved. A roar rose out of Villa Park louder than any heard in a long while. Sherwood, hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach Tony Parks, looked like he was emitting the most decibels. In the instant Christian Benteke rolled the ball beyond Ben Foster from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted. Christian Benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for Aston Villa . Benteke celebrates his goal with Aston Villa team-mates Jack Grealish and Andreas Weimann . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood celebrates the winning goal that gave him his first win in charge at the club . Gabby Agbonlahor threads the ball through Ben Foster's legs to open the scoring for Aston Villa in the first half . Agbonlahor salutes the crowd in celebration after opening the scoring at Villa Park . Brad Guzan looks on in horror as Saido Berahino nods home from close range after a knock-down from Joleon Lescott . West Brom's top scorer for the season Berahino wheels away in celebration after equalising for the visitors . Alan Hutton was lucky not to be sent off after this dangerous high tackle on Berahino - both players were booked for the melee . Aston Villa (4-3-1-2): Guzan 6; Hutton 6.5, Okore 7, Clark 6.5, Lowton 6; Cleverley 6.5 (Bacuna 77), Westwood 6.5, Delph 7.5; N\u2019Zogbia 7 (Grealish 59 6); Benteke 7.5, Agbonlahor 8 (Weimann 82).

CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE feature for goals (like Agbonlahor's - above), heat maps, statistics and more. Seven consecutive defeats punctuated by one mighty win. How momentous it proves remains to be seen, the battle will present many turns, but this felt seismic. Sherwood owes a large dose of gratitude to Foster, mind you. In the third minute of added time the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball, bringing down Matt Lowton in the process. Referee Jonathan Moss pointed to the penalty spot. Benteke was the calmest man in the ground, placing the ball the other side of Foster. No longer do Villa hold the unwanted tag of only side in England\u2019s top four divisions without a league win in 2015. It was earned based on a display of vigour, purpose and creativity. Gabby Agbonlahor, scorer of Villa\u2019s first, played his best game in recent memory. Albion boss Tony Pulis conceded Foster had a \u2018poor night\u2019 but refused to blame his No 1. Foster looked shaky throughout and played a part earlier in the decisive goal by only palming Fabian Delph\u2019s shot from long range. He saved Leandro Bacuna\u2019s rebound but Alan Hutton collected the ball and delivered the cross that ultimately led to the penalty award. Hutton\u2019s involvement at this stage was moot. He should have been dismissed earlier for a nasty lunge on Saido Berahino, who received studs into his midriff. Agitated, Berahino reacted. Joleon Lescott appeared to offer Hutton down the tunnel in a ruckus. Moss booked Berahino and Hutton, meaning retrospective action from the FA on the Scottish right-back is unlikely. Before Benteke struck, it had seemed Berahino\u2019s equaliser would crush Villa. In the 66th minute the Albion striker applied a simple header from two yards out after Lescott had headed back Chris Brunt\u2019s corner. His 12th Premier League goal of the season is only three behind Villa\u2019s total \u2014 an example of their struggles as much as his fine form. Foster capped a terrible performance by bringing down Matt Lowton in the third minute of added time for a penalty . Berahino celebrates while being chased by his team-mates, it was his 18th goal of the season in all competitions . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after Agbonlahor's goal . Agbonlahor beat Foster again shortly after but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line . Foster saves himself from a howler during the first half after the ball slipped out of his hands and almost ended up in his own net . Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly . Agbonlahor reacts after West Brom keeper Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in the first half . Sherwood, who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to Stoke in his first home match in charge, was in no mood to downplay his first win as Villa manager. \u2018It was the best feeling in the world,\u2019 he said. \u2018When I left home my missus said she had done the Euromillions. \u00a354million. But I said I would rather have three points all day. Seriously. \u2018It was massive, huge for us. We deserved to win the game but it was nice to get a slice of luck. I thought we started really well and inspired the fans. The boys in the dressing room want to give them a lot of confidence.\u2019 At the end he checked his pulse by pressing fingers to neck. \u2018I was just checking I was still alive,\u2019 he laughed. \u2018But we\u2019re alive and kicking.\u2019 Coming against the club that elected to employ Pulis rather than him in their own relegation fight must have offer pleasure. Foster almost gifted Villa the lead in the 14th minute. He can thank goalline technology that parity was maintained. Delph sent over a cross that was headed back into danger by Benteke. Agbonlahor spun and hit a tame shot that Foster looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it. Replays showed there was an inch in it. But Villa found confidence. In the 23rd minute the home roar was released. Brad Guzan fired a clearance high and long, Benteke leapt to win the flick-on and release Agbonlahor, whose pace left Lescott in the dust. The Villa striker raced into the box and delivered a finish through the legs of Foster, ahead of Gareth McAuley\u2019s dive. As Villa Park erupted, Agbonlahor ran in front of the West Brom supporters cupping his ear. Sherwood jigged down the touchline towards the Holte End, his hands gripped in fists of delight. It was a similar scene at the final whistle and later a disappointed Foster tweeted his apologies. \u2018I love you all,\u2019 he said. Unfortunately for him, those feeling will be reciprocated by Villa and their fans. Not least Sherwood.

        "article": "World powers intensified nuclear talks with Iran yesterday, two days before a deadline for reaching a framework deal. The foreign ministers of the United States, France and Germany cancelled their travel plans for the next few days so they can push for the accord that would lay the foundations for a final settlement with Tehran by the end of June. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's spokeswoman said he would not fly to Boston for a ceremony in honour the late Senator Edward Kennedy, who was his mentor. Officials close to the talks in the Swiss city of Lausanne also confirmed the French and German foreign ministers, Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had cancelled a planned joint trip to Kazakhstan. Scroll down for video . World powers intensified nuclear talks with Iran yesterday, two days before the deadline for reaching a framework deal. Pictured from left:\u00a0US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, US Secretary of State John Kerry, US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond . 'We're hopeful, but there is still a lot of work to be done,' Fabius told reporters on Sunday. Iran denies charges from the West and Israel that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, and says its programme is purely peaceful. It wants the removal of international sanctions that are hurting its economy. The remarks from Fabius contrasted to a hostile blast from Israel, which is not a party to the talks between Iran and the six powers also including China, Russia and Britain. 'This deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet in Jerusalem. Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, feels especially threatened by the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran. Netanyahu referred to advances made by Houthi rebels allied to Tehran in Yemen, and accused the Islamic republic of trying to 'conquer the entire Middle East'. 'The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped,' he said. Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli official who has been spearheading efforts to lobby world powers against the Iran deal, voiced cautious hope that the negotiations would collapse as they have in the past. 'There are still great doubts in the United States as well as in France, even in England,' Steinitz told Israel Radio. US Secretary of State John Kerry,(left) will not fly to Boston for a ceremony in honour of his mentor, the late Senator Edward Kennedy . In the past, Israel has threatened to attack Iran if it is not happy with an eventual deal and has long described France as the negotiating power with views closest to its own. The six world powers are seeking a halt to Iran's most sensitive nuclear work, settling a dispute that dates back more than a decade and has threatened at times to trigger a new Middle East war. Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have been in Lausanne for days to try to reach a preliminary deal by a self-imposed deadline of Tuesday. They held several rounds of talks on Saturday and met again on Sunday morning. Fabius and Steinmeier joined the talks on Saturday, and their counterparts from China, Britain and Russia were to take part later on Sunday. Close as the sides have come to the outline of an agreement, they still have deep disagreements on Iran's demands for uranium enrichment research and the immediate removal of all U.N. and key U.S. and . European Union sanctions. Those disagreements could wreck a deal, officials say. Zarif says the six powers are now the ones who must compromise. 'In negotiations, both sides must show flexibility,' Zarif said on Twitter. 'We have, and are ready to make a good deal for all. We await our counterparts' readiness.' Western officials close to the talks said it was up to Iran to compromise on the remaining sticking points. 'The serious but difficult work continues,' a senior U.S. State Department official said. 'We expect the pace to intensify as we assess if an understanding is possible.' A key point in the framework accord the sides are trying to agree by Tuesday is expected to be the duration of the agreement, which officials from the six-power group said would have to be in place for more than 10 years. The framework accord should be followed by a comprehensive deal by June 30 that includes full technical details.",

Tallin 'Tui' Harding was riding his scooter in front of the family's home in Lehi, Utah with his father Kaj on Saturday afternoon when he suddenly darted in front of his mother's SUV as she was leaving the driveway. The boy's grandfather, Craig Harding, said the mother-of-five is devastated and inconsolable. Tallin 'Tui' Harding was tragically killed just days before his third birthday while riding his scooter when he darted in front of an SUV being driven by his mother in front of their home in Lehi, Utah . Craig Harding, the boy's grandfather said the boy's parents, Nikki and Kaj harding, are devastated and that the mother-of-five was 'inconsolable' 'She is just beside herself,' Craig told Fox 13 Now. 'She hasn't slept since, well, all night long. She hasn't eaten anything. Dad and her are totally distraught, of course.' Craig said his daughter-in-law, Nikki Harding, didn't see her youngest  'because of the height of the vehicle and smallness-of the child' as he 'ran right into the front tire'. Police said young Tallin, nicknamed Tui by his grandfather Albert Cameron IV, immediately died at the scene. Lehi Police Sgt. Bill Loveridge said no citations would be issued for the tragic accident. 'It was very traumatic for everybody,' he told Desert News. Craig described his grandson as a 'delightful' little boy with 'his own little sense of humor, his own little personality'. 'This is something you just don't think about,' he told Fox 13 Now. 'Whoever thinks about having to plan a funeral arrangement for a two-year-old child?' Neighbors have been tying around ribbons in Tui's favorite color, Brigham Young University's blue, on trees in the community as a tribute to the child and his family . Neighbors have been tying ribbons in Tui's favorite color, Brigham Young University's blue, on trees in the community as a tribute to the child and his family. Craig Harding said everyone has also rallied around Nikki, who he described as 'the perfect mother' who 'does everything for everybody'. Nikki Harding took to Tui's memorial page\u00a0on Facebook to personally thank the community for all of their support, and to remember her little boy. 'Tui was the glue that held us all together, always happy and always bringing a smile to all of our faces,' she said. 'He made each one of us a better person and helped us to see the good in life with the beautiful spirit and personality that he had.' 'We were told when Tui was an infant many times that he would not make it and tonight Kaj pointed out to me that he very well could've been taken during the first few months of his little life.' 'My heart is full of gratitude for the outpouring of love and support I feel.' 'And at the same time my heart is also completely broken.' On Tui's Facebook memorial page, Nikki wrote that her son was 'the glue that held us all together, always happy and always bringing a smile to all of our faces'",

        "article": "(CNN)You may not know it, but comedian Trevor Noah actually made a bit of history even before being named to succeed Jon Stewart as host of \"The Daily Show.\" The 31-year-old South African comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in December, but he's better known within the world of standup comedy. In 2013, Noah became the first African comedian to perform on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\" He's been on the cover of Rolling Stone in South Africa, where he's extremely popular.  He's joked about being the son of a black African woman and a white Swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa. \"My mom would be arrested. She would be fined, and still she was like 'ooh, I don't care, I want a white man, ooh,' \" he once told an audience at London's Soho Theater during his standup show \"The Racist.\" \"And my dad was also like, well, you know how the Swiss love chocolate.\" Why mixed-race comic was 'born a crime' Race, identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act. Because of his parents' then-illegal relationship, he joked, \"In the streets, my father couldn't walk with us. He would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile. And my mom could walk with me, but every time the police went by, she would drop me. I felt like a bag of weed.\" Noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid. In 2012, he told NPR that he was fascinated by how Americans discuss race. \"I got to Baltimore, and I was expecting ... because urban means built up and new, you know,\" he said. \"So I got there, and I was, 'Whoa, it's not as urban as people told me.' ... But it's very black. I'll tell you that much.\" Noah told CNN's \"African Voices\" in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera, hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the  2012 documentary \"You Laugh But It's True\" -- he moved to the United States for a year to try to raise his profile. He returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the States, he said. \"Comedy is really getting quite popular in South Africa,\" Noah said. \"It's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream, which is very good. I think the reason it's doing so well is because South Africans need to laugh and South Africans want to laugh.\" Noah has moved to the U.S. permanently and told Newsweek, \"I've always wanted to be a comedian in the world. I don't want to be labeled a South African comedian.\" On \"The Daily Show,\" he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled \"Spot the Africa,\" which juxtaposed modern-day South Africa and the United States. What remains to be seen is whether what the Guardian has described as \"his combination of terribly polite, butter-wouldn't-melt stage presence and biting, often brutal gags\" will translate into success on \"The Daily Show.\"",

Give us a kiss:\u00a0Known for their friendly nature, the beluga whales have developed an incredible bond with their carers . Standing tall: The whales have a remarkable ability to rise from the water and, despite being mischievous, follow their trainers' orders . Rarely seen in the wild, the astonishing images show a lighter side to the mysterious marine mammals, of which there are less than 80,000 less worldwide . The whales have a small, blunt head with a small beak, tiny eyes and thick layers of blubber, as well as singular blowhole which can be used to squirt water . 'The trainers even told me that at times, it is the animals that try to get their attention, not the other way around. 'They are trying to help preserve sea life at the centre, their research with help protect the species in the years to come. Many of the animals were rescued after being found injured, sick or in some cases taken in after their mothers were found dead. 'These animals are very talkative and can be pretty loud, they even have the nickname 'sea canary birds' because they 'talk' so much. 'It was heart-warming to watch the animals playing with so much energy, they are extremely intelligent creatures. 'There is much to learn about these animals as they still quite mysterious but it was an amazing experience to be able to get so close to them.'

        "article": "(CNN)Chelsea claimed the first silverware of the English domestic season and Jose Mourinho's first trophy of his second spell in charge with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Sunday. Deflected efforts either side of halftime from Chelsea captain John Terry and leading scorer Diego Costa dashed Tottenham's hopes in the all-London League Cup final. Chelsea had suffered a chastening Christmas defeat to the same opposition in the English Premier League, with Harry Kane starring, but the promising young English striker was kept largely quiet in the showpiece occasion. The first half saw Tottenham edge the possession and carry more of the attacking threat, with Dane Christian Eriksen's free kick rattling the Chelsea crossbar. But chances for either side from open play  were in short supply and it was from a free kick that Chelsea went ahead just before the break. Willian's delivery from the right brushed Danny Rose's head and fell invitingly to Terry whose shot went into the net after taking a deflection off Eric Dier. Tottenham might have felt hard done by and the sense of injustice would have deepened on 56 minutes as Cesc Fabregas found Costa down the left and his firm strike took another wicked deflection, this time off Walker, who was credited with the own goal, to leave goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with no chance. It seemed to take the sting out of the Tottenham challenge and although Kane had a late half chance, it was Terry who typically snuffed out the threat with a timely tackle. It was the fifth time Chelsea had lifted the English League Cup and third under Mourinho. The Portuguese claimed it in his first season with the west London club in 2005 and after returning to the Stamford Bridge hot seat last season has broken his mini-trophy drought. Mourinho, whose side is also well-placed to go through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, was clearly reveling in his latest success, his 21st career trophy as a manager. \"'It is important to feel like a kid at 52 years old,\" he said. Man of the match Terry is hoping it will pave the way for further triumphs. \"It's the first trophy this season and it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us when we won it in Jose's first year in 2005 as well,\" he said. \"That could be the start of something very good. We have to kick on and we have got the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win.\" Man City blow . Chelsea was also boosted by an earlier result in the EPL as its nearest title rival Manchester City was beaten 2-1 at Liverpool. City had hoped to cut the gap at the top on Chelsea to just two points with a win at Anfield, but instead suffered a chastening reverse. Jordan Henderson put Liverpool ahead with a thumping shot after just 11 minutes only for Edin Dzeko to draw City, defending the EPL title, level midway through the first half. Liverpool, looking to boost its own chances of Champions League football next season, dominated after the break and deservedly took three points after Philippe Coutinho scored a superb late winner with a curling shot which flew past Joe Hart. Arsenal stayed third by beating Everton 2-0 with Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky scoring late in each half to give the Gunners a boost after a Champions League defeat to Monaco in midweek.",

        "article": "Louise Thomas, 43, from Cheam, was convinced she was suffering panic attacks . Panic attacks are extremely common, with one in ten of us thought to suffer from them at least occasionally. Louise Thomas - and her doctors - were convinced she was one of the millions affected. A panic attack typically causes a faster heartbeat, dizziness, nausea and an overwhelming sense of anxiety. Mother-of-two Louise had experienced such episodes regularly for seven years. 'In my early 30s, I started having episodes of feeling very nervous and anxious, with butterflies in my stomach and a feeling of being on edge,' says the 43-year-old. 'This could last all day. Sometimes, I wouldn't know where the last 30 seconds had gone and would feel confused, but still nervous and agitated, wondering what had just happened.' She was prescribed antidepressants and tried talking therapies, but nothing helped. That's because Louise, from Cheam, Surrey, wasn't suffering from panic attacks at all, but epileptic seizures. Her problems were neurological rather than psychological. And her story is not uncommon. As Paul Salkovskis, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Bath, explains, the symptoms of a panic attack can overlap with an epileptic seizure. 'It's not unusual for people with panic attacks to get an incorrect preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy, and occasionally, people with epilepsy get a misdiagnosis of panic attacks. If they see a specialist, it is usually clarified,' he says. Unfortunately, Louise didn't see a specialist for years. So how can the conditions be confused? Epilepsy, which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK, is characterised by recurrent seizures or sudden bursts of intense, abnormal electrical activity in the brain that disrupt the way it works. But there are many kinds of epileptic seizure. Dr Hannah Cock, consultant neurologist at St George's Hospital, London, and the University of London, says: 'The bit of the brain where the seizure starts and the path where the electrical discharge then spreads can vary enormously between individuals - which is why there are so many different ways people can experience an epileptic seizure.' One such example is with gelastic seizures - where patients may burst out laughing for no apparent reason, because the part of the brain involved in the seizure is also involved in laughter. Other seizures may involve a feeling of deja vu, which can make diagnosis difficult, since this is 'a normal phenomenon that we all sometimes experience', says Dr Cock, who is also clinical adviser to the charity Epilepsy Action. 'As the experience is so recurrent and frequent, it usually becomes clear that something else is going on,' she says. 'Or if the laughing attack is followed by losing consciousness and having a convulsion, diagnosis is easier.' Louise struggled to understand what was happening for seven years after her first episode . But a further complication is that seizures may cause someone to panic, adds Professor Salkovskis. 'It's perfectly possible that people with epilepsy will get panicky at the prospect of having a seizure. And in panic attacks, people hyperventilate, which can trigger an epileptic attack in people who are vulnerable to it.' One key differences between them is that while a seizure can lead to loss of consciousness, a panic attack usually won't, he says. But diagnosis can be hard, as there's no definitive test for epilepsy. An MRI scan can identify possible causes such as scarring on the brain, while an electroencephalogram, where electrodes are attached to the scalp, can help detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. But this can also be normal in people with epilepsy, or show minor changes in people without. After her first episode, Louise looked up her symptoms online, which suggested she'd had a panic attack. Her GP suggested it was a delayed reaction to an incident a couple of years earlier, when she found an intruder breaking in to her house. 'This seemed to make sense. I'd been a quivering wreck at the time. I was a busy mum with two young kids, so I was a bit stressed.' The next seven years were fraught as Louise struggled to understand what was happening. She became a 'nervous wreck'. 'I went back and forth to the doctor's - I must have seen ten GPs in total - but, each time, I was told it sounded like panic attacks or depression. 'I remember the terms \"post-traumatic disorder\" and \"generalised anxiety disorder\" were also used. But there was never further investigation. I was given antidepressants and, one time, a Valium-type drug to calm me down.' But the drugs didn't work, and Louise would stop taking them after a few months. Husband\u00a0Vincent took Louise to the GP and explained the attacks from his perspective - and her episodes were finally diagnosed corretly . 'I was just told to take them again. I even tried cognitive behaviour therapy online and had requested counselling, but nothing helped,' she says. 'This just fuelled my stress. I became a stroppy, emotional rollercoaster. My poor husband, Vincent, had to cope with me just going through the motions.' Meanwhile, her 'panic attacks' were getting worse: she was having five a day and experiencing urinary incontinence when they occurred. 'A few times, I fell down the stairs and was badly bruised; other times, I burnt myself on the oven and the iron. I even drove into a tree with both children in the car. Fortunately, I was going slowly, but it was terrifying. At that point, I knew something was really wrong.' In 2011, seven years after the panic attacks began, Vincent took Louise to the GP and explained the attacks from his perspective. 'He said that when I had an attack, I'd involuntarily raise my arm and start tutting. I wasn't even aware of this. But despite it sounding so odd, the GP still seemed to think this could tie in with a panic attack, so we decided to see a neurologist privately for a second opinion.' The specialist diagnosed Louise with temporal lobe epilepsy, a common type affecting the part of the brain concerned with emotion and hearing, as well as language and memory. The cause, in her case, was unknown, although brain tumours, head injuries, brain infections and strokes can all cause epilepsy. Dr Cock says: 'In temporal lobe seizures, common warning signs are feelings of intense anxiety, fear and panic, so these are ones more likely to be misdiagnosed as panic attacks. Structures in and close to the temporal lobe may also cause the heart to race and the sweating that may go along with it. 'Other signs may include deja vu and some experience \"gastric rising\" - that feeling in the stomach when you go over a humpback bridge. 'During the seizure, the patient may look blank and be completely amnesiac through the episode, losing a bit of time.' People with epilepsy may also have involuntary facial or hand movements, as Louise did, which indicate the electrical discharge has spread to an area of the brain involved in movement. Epilepsy does not tend to worsen over time but, if left untreated, the continued, unexplained seizures can fuel further anxiety, which may make the seizures worse. 'Generally, if people are not diagnosed, that causes anxiety and depression and increases stress levels, which may make seizures more frequent and more serious,' says Dr Cock. 'Whether stress itself causes seizures is controversial, but it's likely that, in some individuals, it may be a trigger - perhaps because stress leads to other triggers, such as alcohol and sleep deprivation.' Louise was relieved to finally find out what was wrong with her - but the diagnosis was frightening. 'It never occurred to me that I might have epilepsy. Being told was like being told I was going to die. 'The thought of all the seizures I'd had in public - on buses, at school meetings - was humiliating.' It took several months for Louise's psychological and neurological symptoms to become untangled. Even after being diagnosed with epilepsy, one neurologist thought she was experiencing non-epileptic seizures as well - seizures that are believed to have a psychological basis and are not caused by disrupted electrical brain activity. These seizures account for up to 30 per cent of people referred to epilepsy clinics. After her diagnosis, Louise was given antidepressants - which can sometimes help with non-epileptic seizures - along with anti-epileptic medication, which works by changing levels of chemicals in the brain that conduct electrical impulses. 'The side-effects of these drugs were horrible. It was like a 24-hour hangover,' she says. 'And I was still having seizures.' Because of the seizures, she had to give up her driving licence. However, things started to look up when, in 2012, she was referred to Dr Cock. Her medication was switched to lamotrigine - a different anti-epileptic drug. And two years ago, the seizures stopped. 'It was a huge relief,' says Louise. 'I could still have one tomorrow, but I used to dread waking up in the morning. Now I can live a normal life again.'

Outrage: This is a picture of two Holy Spirit students (right) dressed as a monkey and a banana as they taunted Atlantic City's majority black basketball team (one player seen wearing white, left) Jay Connell, athletic director at Holy Spirit, told The Press Of Atlantic City: 'I am not going to kick anyone out of school or whip anybody.

Atlantic City's athletic director Anthony Nistico said: 'What I am appalled at is there are adults there that let this happen,' he said. He added that the boys also hid behind a shower curtain and jumped out in an apparent attempt to scare the opposing team as they played. 'These two students were allowed to walk into the gym in these costumes and with this shower curtain,' he said. 'What were the adults thinking? Where were the refs?' Shockingly, a poll on the Press Of Atlantic City website found 50.3 per cent of people felt the students shouldn't be punished as many students dress up for the event. Atlantic City beat Holy Spirit 54-53.",

He and Cristoforetti are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station. They are set to return to Earth on May 14. To date the clip of their hairdressing antics has been watched more than 50,000 times. Many fans have thanked them for sharing the behind-the-scenes footage. It's not the first time Virts has cut\u00a0Cristoforetti's hair. On January 1 he gave the flight engineer a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter. Luckily her short hair is easy to manage but female astronauts with longer locks often find 'bad hair days' are part of the job. In 2013, Karen Nyberg revealed how it was difficult to wash her long blonde hair in space. The mechanical engineer was on board Expedition 36 to the International Space Station at the time. In a video uploaded to Twitter Ms Nyberg was seen placing water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles. Smooth hair: A head shot of Cristoforetti before her space mission .

Two person job: As her short dark crop is trimmed into shape, Cristoforetti uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters - She also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment . She then worked leave-in shampoo through her hair. It was seen stood on its end as she worked a comb through it. Her tools were stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping. To finish, she towel-dried her head dry. She claimed the results left her barnet feeling 'squeaky clean' For men, shaving is the same as it is on Earth. Although, again, they  use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away. Elsewhere on the grooming front, astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as\u00a0water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity, . There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) \u00a0- no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water. In microgravity, water clings to the body instead of running down it, so astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers. There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) so taking sponge baths also saves water. In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean. The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station. 'Astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts' eyes,' explained the Canadian Space Agency. 'Loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration.' Shaving in space is similar to shaving on Earth; astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air, like with a haircut. Astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor, but most are said to prefer the latter, because it doesn't require water and automatically collects hair. And, no water is wasted, because as it dries on a person's head, it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water. Space woman: It's not the first time Virts has cut Cristoforetti's hair - on January 1 he gave a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter . Welcome to the space gym: Along with keeping her grooming in check, Cristoforetti also works out twice a day . In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean. The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station.

Along with keeping her grooming in check, Cristoforetti also works out twice a day. Other Vine videos show her in the 'space gym' doing rowing pulls, shoulder presses and squats. As their bodies are not working against the force of gravity, astronauts exert little effort to get around. Therefore, they face bone density and muscle loss if they don't keep their fitness levels in check during missions. To enable them to use gym equipment in zero-g, they wear harnesses and bungee straps.\u00a0Cristoforetti says training and nutrition is very important to her while working in such tough conditions.",

        "article": "It all started as an innocent attempt to find clams, but left a small fox in a tense standoff with a 500lb brown bear. As the two animals faced one another on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in southern Alaska, it seemed there would only be one inevitable ending. But miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear, the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the Alaskan brown bear just wanted someone to play with. A red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear . But it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate, and the fox and bear played a game of chase . American photographer Nate Zeman was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size. The 32-year-old, of Breckenridge, Colorado, said: 'The bear appeared from the forest, located about a mile away, and began to make a beeline straight towards us. 'The bear walked straight past me at a very close distance and kept going towards the fox, and began to chase it. 'The fox, however, easily outmanoeuvred the bear as it was chased in circles a couple of times, and when they stopped they both squared off about thirty feet apart.' The agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive, not running at full speed . And despite the tense stand-off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play. The pair were seen running in circles, neither at full speed, with the agile fox deftly managing to stay out of harm's way. 'Most likely the bear just wanted to chase the fox, and it's as simple as that,' added Mr Zeman. 'It wasn't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill, it just really seemed to want a chase! The fox had been calmly searching for clams on the\u00a0tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in Alaska . But the red fox's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it . The 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming . Both animals faced eachother, and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox . 'Soon after I took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming, the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away.' The Alaskan brown bear is the name of any member of the grizzly bear family that lives in the coastal regions of southern Alaska. They are the second largest type of brown bear in the world, only after the giant bears of Kodiak Island. As the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began . The fox managed to dodge the bear and both were seen running in circles across the Alaskan salt flats . Photographer Nate Zeman said neither animal was aggressive and both seemed to be playing a game .",

The confectionery giant has launched special edition apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kats for the Japanese market. Nestle came up with the idea after it surveyed Japanese chocolate fans and found apple and carrot were the flavours that most would like to see. Scroll down for video . The Japanese arm of Nestle has launched an apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kat in the country for Easter . The idea has proved so popular apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kats have now gone into production in time for Easter. The chocolate sweet made by Nestle has existed as a product since the 1920s and is now sold all over the world. Versions of KitKats sold in Japan are well-known for being different to the main product sold elsewhere in the world with limited editions often made available for Christmas and Halloween. The carrot flavoured KitKat is the firm's first attempt at coming up with a product for the Easter market. The new Kit Kat was created after Japanese customers were asked for their favourite flavour combinations . In special versions of the chocolate there will be limited editions, featuring a bunny and Easter message . The treats went on sale from today and are priced at 540 yen (\u00a33) for a pack of 12. For the first time in the company's 42-year history in Japan they will use a bunny . A spokesman for Nestle said: \"We will have 13 different designs, so anybody who wants to collect all the labels may have to buy more than one packet.\" He said in addition every 30th chocolate bar would have a limited special edition design for collectors. Kit Kats are extremely popular in Japan, with novelty forms such as Special Chilli already being sold . Kit Kats are considered lucky In Japan and Tokyo already has its own chocolatory for special flavours . Japan is no stranger to novelty forms of KitKat. Last year the confectionery giant launched bake-ready versions of the snack which can either be baked and eaten or consumed raw. Other flavours included\u00a0Sublime Bitter, Special Sakura Green Tea and Special Chilli. Tokyo has its own KitKat Chocolatory in Seibu Department Store in Ikebukuro which produces limited edition versions of the snack, considered lucky in Japan.",

        "article": "The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was taken on an emotional \u2018last farewell\u2019 fly-past of the pilot\u2019s home island of Penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away, according to a British pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place. The unusual overflying of Penang is \u2018perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator\u2019 he says. The theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline, has gained support from one of Britain\u2019s top flight safety specialists, David Learmount of the respected Flight International magazine and flightglobal website. Scroll down for video . Missing: MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 2014 for an approximate six-hour flight to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew . The unusual overflying of Penang, pictured, where the captain of the lost Boeing is from, is \u2018perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator\u2019 Captain Hardy spent six months analysing the flight data of the stricken aircraft, which disappeared almost a year ago with 239 people on board, in a bid to solve the mystery. He has concluded that the search in the vast Indian ocean being conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is. He also believes the riddle of the aircraft\u2019s odd dog-leg flight path immediately after take-off from Kuala Lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final \u2018fly-past\u2019 of Malaysia\u2019s Penang island to allow someone to have \u2018a last emotional look.\u2019 Captain Hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor. Details are reported in the Sunday Times. Captain Hardy says that after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 16.41 GMT on March 7 last year, flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the China Sea where four flight information regions intersect. The last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain\u2019s was the last voice heard. Captain Hardy said the flight did something \u2018quite remarkable\u2019 by flying in and out of the airspace of Malaysia and Thailand eight times noting: \u2019I\u2019ve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers.\u2019 The captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, left, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor, right . Missing: Searchers scouring huge swathes of the world's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it . After flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards Penang, one of three turns made in quick succession. 'It took me months to work out what this was. 'The clue was Ayers Rock,\u2019 he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of Australia. 'I have done the same manoeuvre there, to look down and get a great view. Somebody was taking a last emotional look at Penang.\u2019 He explained: \u2019I thought of this at 5am, went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from.\u2019 Noting that pilot Shah was from Penang while co-pilot Hamid was from Selangor, he said: \u2018Someone did a nice long turn and looked down on Penang. It\u2019s perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator.\u2019 Military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 GMT heading South towards the navigation waypoint Anoko. It then flew straight for thousands of miles before, it is believed, ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Australia. Australian investigators believe the plane crashed. But Captain Hardy believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea \u2013 explaining why no wreckage has ever been found. Australian investigators said they had been in touch with Captain Hardy and described his theory as \u2018credible.\u2019 Flight magazine\u2019s Mr Learmount said: \u2018Since Capt Simon Hardy revealed in Flightglobal/Flight International his calculations about where Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is likely to have come to rest, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau \u2013 leading the MH370 search team \u2013 has spoken at length to him. \u2018Despite worldwide interest in his work, nobody \u2013 yet \u2013 has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound.\u2019",

A student group has demanded that a university building is renamed after a convicted murderer. The Black Student Union at UC Berkeley wants to honour Assata Shakur, the first woman on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists, with the name change. Shakur was found guilty of shooting New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. The 67-year-old former Black Panther activist escaped from prison two years later and is thought to be hiding in Cuba. The union believes she represents an 'icon of resistance within oppressed communities',\u00a0Fox News reported. Cori McGowens, a junior at the university, said: 'We want the renaming of it to [go to] someone, Assata Shakur, who we feel represents us as black students.' The students have also asked the university to hire two black admissions officers, two black psychologists and two black advisers. They are  hoping an African-American resource center will be created. Their request for a building, thought to be Barrows Hall, to be renamed has split reactions on social media. One user @Ilianerrz wrote on Twitter: 'WHY DO STUDENTS AT UC BERKLEY (sic) WANT TO NAME A BUILDING AFTER ASSATA SHAKUR?!??' And Janine Simone said: 'What is this world coming to? #police #PoliceLivesMatter.' But some people supported the idea. Shakur (right) was found guilty of shooting New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster (left) in 1977. The 67-year-old, previously known as Joanne Chesimard, escaped from prison two years later and is thought to be hiding in Cuba . One user with the handle @ismokethentweet wrote: 'Shout out to the black student organization at UC Berkeley who's demanding one of their buildings to be named after Assata Shakur.' Nicholas Dirks, UC Berkeley's chancellor, said he has not yet made a decision. He said more staff had been hired recently and two programmes to help black students earn advanced degrees had been granted funding. He added: 'Too many students have told us about being excluded from study groups, ignored during class discussions, verbally harassed at parties and social events, and feeling in a general sense, vulnerable, isolated, and invisible. The Black Student Union's request for a building to be renamed has split reactions on social media with some questioning the idea and others taking to Twitter to show their support . 'This is something we deplore.' UC Berkeley had 36,204 students enrolled last year. Around three per cent were black, according to university data. The FBI is offering a $2million reward for any information that leads to Shakur's capture.",

        "article": "Andre Spicer is Professor of Organizational Behavior, Cass Business School at City University London. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. LondonApple CEO Tim Cook has released the much-anticipated Apple watch -- his company's first new product since the iPad. Cook said the new watch, in addition to telling the time, was a \"comprehensive health and fitness companion.\" But we're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time. Our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users. But they also have a hidden, darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about. As part of a research project with Alberto Rizzoli, we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches. One participant, a judge, hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention. The dilemma is familiar to many of us. We spend our days engaged in social interaction. Huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues. However when we are in these meetings, our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up. We may want to check these incoming messages, but know it would be rude to glance at our phone. When one of the first smartwatches came to market, the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem. We found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive. It also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone. Surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches. They were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count. We also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the \"phantom device effect.\" They would compulsive check their watch not just for the time, but for a wide range of information. In some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist. Some would feel a phantom buzz, notifying them of an imaginary incoming email. The phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become. Recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day, starting just minutes after waking up. We also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events. We used to worry that the average American watched television for six hours a day. Now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we're awake. Indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep. This raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives. In the work Carl Cederstr\u00f6m and I have done on the hidden dangers of wearables, a big big concern is privacy. The Apple Watch, like most wearables, is essentially a tracking device, recording heart rate, sleep patterns, movement, whereabouts, and much more depending on the apps installed. All this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis. The result? A database of personal information of which the Stasi could only have dreamed. As well as sucking up personal information, wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness. By pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop, we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms. Data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace, making people not just health conscious, but also self-obsessed. Instead of checking in with social networks, we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms. As a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world. As we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past. Not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry. As a result, we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves, giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy. If Apple's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches, it's likely to create a step change in our lives. We already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago. Widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails, people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream, planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings. Rather than talking about what was on television last night, people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns. When this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived.

        "article": "A young man who is torn between  the rough streets of his hometown and a bright future as a basketball star is poised to make a splash in March Madness after keeping his brother away from violence. Isaiah Williams, a 22-year-old forward and junior at Iona College, says he has lost 24 of his friends and loved ones to violence in a section of Newark, New Jersey, called The Jungle. Teammates say that the star 6'7'' player has gone through periods of crying regularly at practice after losing some of his best friends to shootings related to drugs and gangs, but works harder than anyone. Isaiah Williams, (left) 22, grew up in a section of Newark known for gang crime and has grieved for 24 friends that died due to gun violence . Though his team stands on the brink of the national spotlight, Williams has never been fully free of the forces pulling him back to the troublesome past where his loved ones still live. After the death of friend Rahmel Johnson, 20, in 2013, the basketball star left his college life without telling his coaches and went back home to intervene with his brother Kevin, a year younger. Newark's Oscar Miles Village is controlled by the Crips gang and surrounded by rivals, and Williams felt he had to pull his brother, who was with Johnson right before his targeted shooting, out of a dangerous life, according to\u00a0NJ.com. The guard, who has Family First tattooed on his chest, returned when Kevin vowed to stay off the streets. This season Williams helped lead Iona to first place in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and his brother Kevin attends his games. His life at college is a far cry from his time growing up, where he was immersed in violence that saw him shot at three times. Gunmen sprayed shots at him near his neighborhood rec center, after a fight and riding in a car through a rival neighborhood. The basketball star gives a litany of his friends who have been killed in similar incidents: P-Roc, Smoove,  Goldie, Capo, T Ram, Hot Dog and many others. Though the star forward dropped everything and went to intervene in his brother's life last season, the 6'7'' player has led Iona College to first place in their conference this year . Oscar Miles Village in Newark is controlled by the Crips gang, and rivalries with surrounding gangs lead to a high homicide rate. There were 111 homicides in Newark in 2013. While others were never had a chance leave, Williams found his escape in basketball. 'My friends wanted me to join them. At one time I did, but when I got a little older I said, 'I have to go shoot baskets.' It was my therapy. It took my mind off everything that was around me,' he told the\u00a0Bradenton Herald. Mr Williams attended seven high schools and colleges before arriving at Iona, and was named\u00a0Suncoast Conference Player of The Year at State College of Florida Bradenton before transferring to a Division I school closer to home. Iona's location New Rochelle, New York, means he help his loved ones such as Kevin, and his girlfriend Ille and family have been able to watch him thrive despite an injury this season. He now shoots more than 50 per cent from the floor and averages more than 13 points per game while majoring in criminal justice. Williams attended a number of high school and colleges before being accepted to play at Iona College, roughly 30 miles from where he grew up in Newark . Recovering from hardship and improving himself have always been part of his mindset. 'He would beg me to try to get me into the gym with him. I would have to open the gym for him late at night and early in the morning,' his coach in Florida and current assistant coach\u00a0Brock Erickson told\u00a0One-Bid Wonders. The Iona Gaels play Siena College on Saturday, with a shot at the NCAA tournament if they advance and can claim their conference championship. Beyond hoping to make an impact at this year's college basketball postseason, Mr Williams hopes that he can make it even further. He has hopes to play in the NBA or Europe. 'I'm going to try to go as hard as I can and if possible make the NBA,' he said. 'That's what I want to do. If I don't get drafted, okay.

        "article": "Adam Ashe admits Scotland are desperate to avoid a Six Nations whitewash \u2014 even if victory over Ireland today means handing the Championship crown to old rivals England. Defeat at Murrayfield today would ensure a fourth wooden spoon and third whitewash in 12 years for the home side, who have been relegated to a mere sideshow in what is set to be thrilling finish to this year\u2019s tournament. Adam Ashe is determined to spoil the Irish party\u00a0at Murrayfield on Saturday . The day kicks off with Italy playing Wales at the Stadio Olimpico, before Scotland host Ireland and then England round things off against France at Twickenham. Wales, Ireland and England are all locked on six points each, with the destination of the title set to be decided on points difference. As things stand, England are in the driving seat with a points difference of 37 from their first four games, with Ireland on 33 and Wales off the pace with 12. The Irish will be determined to run in the tries against Scotland, so as to apply pressure to Stuart Lancaster\u2019s men when the take on the temperamental French. Ashe, for his part, is determined to spoil the party. \u2018Ireland are focusing on a big win and looking forward to taking the title but we don\u2019t want to let that happen, regardless who goes on to win the Championship,\u2019 said the Glasgow Warriors forward. Ashe doesn't think his selection was a gamble for such an important match . \u2018I would say there is more pressure on us going into this match because we have been losing games while playing well. \u2018Yes, Ireland have got a lot of pressure on them to win the Championship \u2014 but that could be taken out of their hands by us.\u2019 Ashe, who has been brought into the Scotland side at the expense of Rob Harley, denied it was a gamble throwing him in from the start of a such an important match. The 21-year-old, who picked up a neck injury playing against New Zealand back in November, said he was now at peak fitness despite playing a total of just 94 minutes of professional rugby in 2015. \u2018I played in the Munster game a few weeks ago and that was my first game back after three months out,\u2019 said Ashe. \u2018I had a bit of a reaction with my neck a few days after but it settled down quickly enough. That was always going to happen coming back from my injury. \u2018Although I have not played much rugby, I am hungry for it. I am not just physically ready but also mentally ready, too. I want to go out there and give everything I\u2019ve got against Ireland. \u2018It was tough missing the first three Six Nations games through injury but I am glad to be back involved and able to do my part.\u2019",

Dean Smith, from Scottsdale, Arizona, made a video for his girlfriend Jennifer Kessel that showed the 365 days he asked for her hand in marriage. The reveal happened during a large family trip to Aruba, where Jennifer was instructed via a whiteboard held by her sister Jaclyn to go down to the lobby.

        "article": "The man who became an internet sensation after he badly missed a $1million halfcourt shot has revealed he came up short because his strength is gone due to a rare disorder that caused five of his organs to fail. Scott Park took, and missed, the halfcourt shot on Friday during halftime of the ACC Tournament semifinal between Notre Dame and Duke. A Vine capturing his failed attempt quickly began spreading on the internet. It has been viewed more than 7.6 million times, although there is no way to know how many mean comments have been made. Scott Park, 56, took a halfcourt shot at halftime of the ACC semifinal game between Notre Dame and Duke . His attempt fell badly short of the mark and a Vine capturing the moment began spreading on the web . Park, 56, knew the ball wasn't going in when he shot it because serious medical problems have sapped his strength, but he still wanted to give it a try, according to the\u00a0Sporting News. Those who laughed shouldn't  feel too badly, though. The Navy environmental engineer doesn't have a problem with all the attention the shot has gotten. He said: 'I'm happy to be alive. I'm happy to even have a chance to shoot for a million dollars. 'I had no illusions that ball was going in.' In 2007, Park had open heart surgery and was forced to go back to the hospital two days later because something was wrong. Doctors couldn't figure out why, but Park's kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder and pancreas were shutting down. Things got so bad that one of Park's doctors began preparing his wife Ellen for his death. Park's wife Ellen was at the game. He has a\u00a0blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome . Patients with CAPS like Park have a 48 per cent mortality rate, primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest . After a last-ditch effort, all of Park's organs, except his kidney, began to respond and he was eventually diagnosed with a blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). The rare disorder has only been diagnosed about 400 times. The syndrome is 'a rapidly progressive life-threatening disease that causes multiple organ thromboses and dysfunction in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies', according to the Journal of Intensive Care Medicine. Patients with CAPS have a 48 per cent mortality rate,\u00a0primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest. Park had two years of dialysis but was able to get a kidney transplant from someone who goes to his church. He survived becoming the first person in the world with CAPS to have successful transplant surgery of any kind. The medical miracle, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia, now must take 39 pills each day and get an injection of an experimental drug once every two weeks, but he's healthy. All of that explains why the joke really wasn't on Park at all. He said: 'The Lord has blessed me probably as much or more than a lot of people. 'I feel that every day. 'God has been a power in my life, and he keeps giving me miracles every day.'",

        "article": "Most little girls will exchange bracelets and gifts with their closest friends, but one eight-year-old has been receiving trinkets from a more unusual source - the birds in her garden. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The youngster has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Scroll down for video and listen to an interview with Gabi . Gabi Mann (above) leaves peanuts out for the crows in her neighbourhood and in return they leave her gifts . Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life\u00a0and the BBC.\u00a0'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' The image above shows just some of Gabi's favourite items left for her by birds in exchange for peanuts . Gabi and her mother leave nuts for the crows on a bird feeder (above) along with fresh water in a water bath . Listen to the full podcast by The BitterSweet Life when they visited Gabi and her mother Lisa in Seattle . Her strange relationship with the birds began in 2011 when as a four-year-old she would accidentally drop food. Groups of crows began loitering around the family house hoping to pick up the scraps Gabi left behind. When she started going to school, Gabi began feeding them her lunch. The birds then started lining up to wait for the youngster to get off her bus at the end of the school day. Two years later Gabi and her mother Lisa began leaving food outside in their garden on a daily basis - filling the bird bath with water and leaving peanuts on feeders. Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat.\u00a0The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. Gabi keeps all of the bits in carefully labelled pots and ranks them according to her favourite. She said: 'I think they know my favourite colour - blue. They know that I like Lego and shiny things. They are my type.' Crows are known to be highly intelligent creatures - capable of solving complex puzzles and problems to obtain food. Experts say they can often form strong bonds with people that feed them, but equally can mark out those that they consider a threat. People who have thrown stones at crows or tried to help an injured chick can find themselves mobbed by the creatures for weeks or even years afterwards. In perhaps the most astonishing story, however, Gabi's mother Lisa describes how the crows in their neighbourhood appear to keep watch over the family. Lisa Mann and her daughter Gabi (above) have formed a unique bond with the crows in their neighbourhood . She said that on one occassion she had been out taking photographs of an eagle when she dropped her lens cap on the floor and forgot to pick it up before walking home. She said: 'About an hour later I went back outside to see if I could find it and a crow had put it on the side of one of the bird baths. 'I looked at the surveillence video to find out if it was a crow and you can see it bring it into the yard, walk it to the bird bath and spends time rinsing the lens cap and puts it on the side of the bird bath. It was pretty impressive. 'I'm sure it was intentional. They watch us all the time.' Gabi Mann keeps her collection of gifts from the birds carefully arranged in bags and pots shown above . Gabi herself believes her relationship with the crows has given her a special bond with the natural world and calls herself Nature Girl. She is highly protective of the gifts she has received from the birds, not allowing anyone to touch the trinkets. Her mother said: 'For the most part the common denominator is that they are shiney and small enough to fit in their mouth.' Professor John Marzluff, an expert on avian social ecology at the University of Washington, said he believes the crows may be offering up the gifts as they would to a potential mate. Speaking to The BitterSweet Life podcast, he said: 'I have seen an awful lot of things crows bring people. They do bring gifts whether it is always going to happen, I don't think so. The crows regularly carry gifts, like above, to the water bath and bird feeder in the family's garden after eating . 'Certain individual crows the bond they form with that person might be more of a courtship bond where they are bringing presents like they would for their mates. 'For some people they are dead baby birds and other people they get shiny pendants or beautiful glass.' For anyone hoping to form a bond with some corvids, he has some advice. 'The best thing you can do if you want to form a bond with a crow is to be consistent in rewarding them for whatever the action is with a few peanuts in the shell,' he said. 'They like that food as it is a high fat high energy food and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground.They quickly habituate to your routine. They will follow you.'",

        "article": "A pregnant woman and her husband were forced to sleep in the car park of an Auckland motel after the receptionist said he had no record of their booking. Unfortunately for Lucy and Gary Best, they had failed to check the TripAdvisor reviews of Epson Motor Inn before they decided to stay there. The couple, from Kerikeri in New Zealand, may have decided to book in somewhere else had they spent some time researching their accommodation. Complaints from past guests range from mould in the bathroom and unpainted walls to blood on the bed sheets. Lucy Best and her husband Gary were forced to sleep in their car after the motel said there was no record . \u2018I thought I was lucky to find somewhere because it was one of a very few that were available,\u2019 Mrs Best told Daily Mail Australia. \u2018I'm not fussy so at $75 a night it sounded reasonable and within distance.\u2019 But when the pair arrived on February 21, they were told the motel was booked out despite Mrs Best having a 'full confirmation' receipt as proof when they went to check in. 'The guy at reception looked confused and said there was no booking for Lucy Best,' Mrs Best said. 'He then gave me a book of motels in the area and told me I should call around. 'I was devastated and it was our first night out together without our two-year-old son since May 2014 so it was rewarding but I ended up in tears trying to find accommodation.' The photo advertised by\u00a0Epsom Motor Inn doesn't appear to add up, according to previous guests . Kel K who stayed at the motel with his wife recently said his room had 'wet carpet with a light fur of mould on it' (left) and 'unfinished repair in the bathroom' (right) Another guest,\u00a0KarolynTimarkos, said the motel should 'invest in exit mould' after staying in an 'unclean' room (left) and old rubbish left behind by previous guests . The 29-year-old said she spent the next few hours scouring through the phone book but the couple had no luck. 'I called every motel, hotel and hostel - while trying not to sob over the phone but every single one said they were fully booked out because of the concert in town,' Mrs Best said. 'We ran out of time because we had to meet up with some friends who had flown in from the UK and then it was time to head to the gig. 'My husband bought some bath towels and we agreed it was looking likely we were to sleep in the truck.' The couple found a quiet cul-de-sac and camped inside their four-wheel-drive overnight. \u2018It was the worst night\u2019s sleep I\u2019ve ever had,\u2019 Mrs Best said. \u2018I am half way through pregnancy and my husband is 1.8 metres tall. \u2018There isn't enough words to describe the anger and upset I felt as it totally ruined what should've been an exciting and happy weekend. \u2018To get no offer of help was disgusting, having worked in customer support myself I was in shock. \u2018But I do feel like I\u2019ve dodged the bullet after reading those horrible reviews on Trip Advisor.\u2019 Mrs Best said she was left in tears after spending hours trying to find another accommodation but had no luck . Motel manager Richie Chen told Daily Mail Australia he feels 'terribly sorry' for Mrs Best and has offered 'free of charge' accommodation. 'We've done what we could,' Chen said . 'Something went wrong on our website and it was something I couldn't fix. I couldn't just ask someone to move out and give the room to her - we don't work like that. 'She was never charged when she made the booking but we have already provided her a complimentary - free of charge accommodation - so everything will be paid for. 'I'm not in a position to comment on the condition of the motel but all I can say is I've done what I can as a manager.' An Auckland Council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia there were no records of complaints but the council will be investigating the motel. The 29-year-old mother said it was the first time in almost a year to spend quality time with her husband Gary . This guest claimed after a ' poor night\u2019s sleep' - he experienced 'a horrible chesty feeling' and the 'taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air' overnight . Mrs Best and her husband were not the only ones who experienced a bad encounter. Another guest, penned under \u2018Sandy59979\u2019 from New Zealand, thought she was entering a \u2018demolition site\u2019 after claiming she had fount piles of rubbish littered outside the motel. \u2018Worse to come inside, mould in the showers etc., towel rail held onto wall with blocks of unpainted wood, windows that didn't close, furniture that was very dirty, and yes stains on the linen,\u2019 Sandy59979 posted on Trip Advisor. \u2018If I hadn't pre-paid I would not have stayed there. I had to park my car almost up to the door of the unit as I felt someone would hit my car trying to get past. \u2018Then I thought I could take my mind off the situation by watching a little telly with a large glass of wine but alas the remote had no back and the batteries were Sellotape in not allowing for very easy operation. \u2018Re the room service etc. that had been advertised on the website, forget it, if it existed I felt the health department would need to be involved. Never have I experienced such a disgusting \"motel \".\u2019 Captioned along this photo (left) by Vivienne P: \u00a0'This is NOT the courtyard as it is today' while others have found pile of rubbish left along the motel . One guest took to the Trip Advisor page, claiming they had found bloodstains and damaged parts of the motel . Madjik posted: 'rusty light shades in the bathroom' that didn't work and moulds along the broke-door fridge . Another guest, 'Kel K', who stayed at the motel with his wife ahead of the Cricket World Cup claimed they had \u2018noticed a strong smell something like mould and cigarette smoke\u2019 inside their room. \u2018We noticed one of the lights wouldn\u2019t work, the fan wouldn\u2019t work, the aircon [sic] wouldn\u2019t work and we could only get one TV channel. There was also a stifling smell of mould in the room. \u2018We found a double bed had been moved to cover a large wet mouldy patch of carpet caused by the aircon dripping inside the wall onto the carpet. Madjik found stains on her spreadsheets as well as droplets of blood during her stay in November 2014 . Sandy said she had found 'moulds in the shower', 'unpainted wood' and 'windows that didn't close' Other guests found cupboard falling apart inside their room (left) and mould and dirt around the fridge (right) Another guest found a 'mouldy sopping wet bedside cabinet' and a broken curtain with a missing clip . \u2018On moving the bed we found the patch was huge (larger than the double bed) and very wet and mouldy and stunk. \u2018This had been like this for some time because the skirting was badly discoloured and the bedside cabinet next to the bed has swelled up like a balloon and was mouldy as well. \u2018As a result we woke after a very poor night\u2019s sleep with a horrible chesty feeling and the taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air all night.'",

Aswat, who is thought to be 40, was arrested in 2005 in Zambia and later flown to the UK. He fought extradition for several years and was held at Broadmoor Hospital before being sent to the US last October. In January the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the British Government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment. His lawyers claimed that it had breached Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Prosecutors say Aswat (background) and Hamza conspired to create a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, 15 years ago . In their ruling at the time, ECHR judges said: 'In light of the specific assurances and additional information received from the United States government, and the careful examination of the case by the High Court in the United Kingdom, the court found that it could not be said that there was a real risk that Mr Aswat would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if extradited. 'The Court therefore considered his complaint to be manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 of the Convention and declared the application inadmissible.' Aswat's lawyers told the court yesterday that he has been treated for mental illness. He will be sentenced on July 31.",

Happy as a clam: Something appeared to have tickled this happy seal on the North Sea sands at Horsey, Norfolk . Mr Reeve, of Reydon, near Southwold, Suffolk, said he was able to capture the incredible images after making a 'connection' with the animal who appeared to be in guffaws of laughter as it lay on the beach. 'I just love taking\u00a0pictures of the seals - they're just such fun creatures,' he said.

The former United left-back, who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002, was impressed by Blind when he played in that position during Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham. It was United's best performance of the season, keeping them anchored in the Premier League top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend's crunch trip to Anfield to play Liverpool. Daley Blind (right) was impressive for Manchester United in Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham . Irwin, seen here celebrating a goal with David Beckham in 1997, believes Blind deserves his place in the team . Sunday's clash between Manchester United and Liverpool will be pivotal in the top four race . 'Daley's a good, honest pro,' Irwin told ManUtd.com. 'He can play at centre-half if you need him, left-back if you need him, and obviously he's played mostly in midfield for us this season. I think he's been a really good signing. 'He's a player who reads situations very, very well, I thought he played extremely well on Sunday. It'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against Liverpool, but it wouldn't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players, because they played so well. 'That's the manager's decision and he's got one or two back from suspension and injury, but I thought the team played very well on Sunday.' Blind sets off in pursuit of Arsenal's Francis Coquelin during last week's FA Cup sixth round tie . Blind celebrates scoring a late equaliser for United at West Ham last month . The Dutch international also scored a crucial late goal at West Brom earlier in the campaign . Dutch international Blind, who arrived at Old Trafford from Ajax for \u00a313.8m last summer, has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the English game. Irwin added: 'I know Blind can fill in places and he's done tremendously well for us in midfield. 'He hasn't played at left-back that many times, he's not played centre-half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there. 'I thought Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were aggressive, didn't give Harry Kane much room, and Antonio Valencia played really well at right-back, so it was good to see and we'll need plenty of that at Anfield.'",

        "article": "An 11-year-old missed out on all the secondary schools she wanted and instead has been offered a place at an academy which was previously in special measures. Courtney Wells, of Birmingham, was one of thousands of children in England who were left disappointed after they missed out on their first choice secondary school place when they were notified yesterday. Her parents listed four schools in order of preference for their daughter but missed out on them all. Instead the 11-year-old, who is due to start year seven in September, has been offered a place at\u00a0Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre. The school became an academy last November after it was placed in special measures in 2013 following a damning Ofsted report which rated it 'inadequate'. Courtney's mother Stacey Wells, 31, said: 'Courtney was really engaged in the whole process of deciding what school she wanted to go to. She went to look at all the schools. Courtney Wells, 11, missed out on all four of her choices for Birmingham secondary schools and was instead offered a place at an academy previously in special measures. Her mother Stacey is appealing the decision . 'We put a white board up in the kitchen and after each open evening she weighed up the pros and cons and gave the school a score out of ten. That's how she decided which schools she would choose. 'We are not wholly surprised that she didn't get into the university school as it looked so amazing that we were expecting it to be inundated with applicants. But we thought she would at least get one of her other choices. Birmingham was one of the worst areas where children missed out on their first choices as secondary school places were confirmed yesterday. A third of children in the city missed out on their first choice school compared to just two per cent in Cornwall. Councils notified parents of their children's fate yesterday by email or letter, meaning some families will not receive the news for several days. Courtney was rejected from her first choice University of Birmingham School (top left), which is being built, her second Shenley Academy (top right), which is closer to her home than the place she has. She was refused her third St Paul's School for Girls (bottom left) and her fourth, Colmers Senior School (bottom right) The 11-year-old applied for four schools - three of which were within 2.5 miles of her home but was rejected and given a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre which was put into special measures in 2013 . 'It is such a worrying time, all we want is the best for our daughter. We are going to appeal and fight this all the way.' The decision to offer Courtney a place at the academy came despite the site being further away from her home than her second choice school. She was also rejected from Colmers School in Rednal, despite having a foster sibling already at the school. Her parents have vowed to appeal the decision. They decided to put just four choices on the form instead of take advantage of listing six options because they thought this would be enough. They listed\u00a0University of Birmingham School, Selly Oak; Shenley Academy, Northfield; St Paul's School for Girls, Edgbaston and Colmers School, Rednal, as their choices. Courtney was rejected from all four of her secondary school choices, despite her second preference being closer to her home and one of her choices being at a school where one of her foster siblings is a pupil . She has been offered a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre, put in special measures in 2013 . The couple's first choice for their daughter, currently a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Northfield, was the new University of Birmingham School, which is opening its doors for the first time in September. A spokeswoman for the school said it had received a staggering 1,100 applications for its 150 places, with 377 pupils putting it as their first choice. Courtney's parents have been told their daughter is currently in 177th place on the waiting list for a place at the sought-after free school, which is financially backed by the university and which has promised it will provide a private education standard without charging fees. The Year 7 intake will consist of 75 pupils living around its site in Bristol Road, Selly Oak, while another 75 will come from homes near Hall Green, Small Heath and the Jewellery Quarter railway stations. Peter Hay, Birmingham City Council's director of people, said: 'If you have applied for an academy, foundation, grammar, voluntary aided or free school and want to appeal against their decision, then you must contact that school directly for details of their appeal arrangements.' Under the admissions system, families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools\u2019 admissions criteria. Many children living in big cities were left disappointed yesterday, and this graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice secondary school when the places were announced on Monday . Factors can include proximity to the school, faith or ability \u2013 with some schools specifying how many bright, average and low ability pupils they will admit. A spokesman for the council said: 'The school admissions team has processed over 15,000 applications for secondary school places this year. Parents in Birmingham can submit up to six preferences, including grammar schools, and we always advise that parents are realistic when making their preferences. 'The advice from the local authority is that parents include at least one preference for a nearby school where their child would have got in under the distance criterion in the past. For the vast majority of families the reason they do not get the first preference is because other children better met the school's admission criteria than their child.' Yesterday more than half a million pupils were notified of their places and a number of appeals are expected.",

        "article": "Jeremy Clarkson could make a return to the BBC as early as next month to front the Top Gear Live world tour, which is set to make more than \u00a310million. BBC bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour, which was planned to be fronted by Jeremy Clarkson along with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond under the BBC Top Gear brand. However the future of the shows, which have sold 200,000 tickets, has been cast into doubt after Clarkson was dismissed from the BBC last week for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) was due to front the Top Gear Live tour from next month, but talks are now underway about how the shows can go ahead and if BBC branding will be removed after he was dismissed . It is understood  if the corporation tries to block the world tour, which starts in Australia next month, from going ahead they could be liable for refunding tickets at a total cost of around \u00a310million. Fans have paid between \u00a335 and \u00a3200 for tickets to the live shows. One option could be to allow the events, which will also take place in London and South Africa, to go ahead under a different name and without some of the key elements of the lucrative BBC show - such as the Stig. A message on the Top Gear Live tour website thanks fans for their 'continued patience'. It says: 'We have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of Jeremy's contract not being renewed by the BBC.' Live Nation, which has been promoting the tour, said it would go ahead in some form but they may have to rebrand. Phil Bowdery said: 'The BBC owns the name and certain aspects of the show. We won;t be able to use any VT of Top Gear. Clarkson, 54, was dismissed from the BBC last month for an unprovoked attack on a Top Gear producer . 'There will be a new name and no Stig because obviously that's their property. We've sold an awful lot of tickets and we want to keep faith with people who bought the tickets.' Sources have claimed there is a small chance the show could go ahead unchanged, but most believe it will have to be significantly changed. It could be renamed Clarkson, May and Hammond Live or MPH Live, the Sunday Mirror reported. Clarkson is already set to return to the BBC on April 24 when he appears as a host on Have I Got News for You. Hat Trick Productions, which makes the show, said there is no reason to believe the show will not go ahead as planned. If the live shows go ahead key elements may have to be removed - such as the mysterious Stig . Tony Hall, the Director-General of the BBC, has had to employ round-the-clock bodyguards after he received a death threat for refusing to reinstate Clarkson. He became a target after taking the final decision to axe Clarkson, the BBC's biggest star, from his \u00a31 million-a-year role presenting the Corporation's biggest global money-spinner. Clarkson's contract was not renewed after\u00a0an internal investigation found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second physical assault, following a prolonged verbal tirade in a row over a hot meal. The 54-year-old's fellow presenters, Richard Hammond and James May, are said to be considering offers by the BBC to star in the corporation's planned version of Top Gear, scheduled for 2016. A spokesman from BBC Worldwide said: 'There\u2019s lots of speculation about Top Gear at the moment \u2013 however no Top Gear Live shows have been cancelled and we are working through the implications of Jeremy\u2019s contract not being renewed. We will update ticket holders as soon as possible.'",

Ziggy's Facebook page has garnered nearly 17,000 likes with an impressive 210,000 views counted on his YouTube video 'Ziggy Trixx - Play Dead - Staffy's Hilarious Reaction to Being \"Shot\"'. Adem said: 'Ziggy has always picked things up really quickly - for example it only took a few days for him to learn how to ride a skateboard, but learning to say hello took much longer. 'Recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise, love, cuddles and of course treats and toys. Surprisingly, Ziggy is actually the first dog Adem has owned or trained. The talented pooch learnt his own name in just one day . Apart from the basic commands such as sitting or shaking hands, Ziggy's first trick was playing dead which he now has down to a fine art . Ziggy and Adem have amazed crowds in Southend-on-Sea with their street performances . 'Other than general commands such as sit, lay down and paw etc, his first trick was to play dead which has become quite a crowd pleaser.

The duo are now focusing on routines rather than individual tricks as they expand Ziggy's skills . The street performer is hoping Ziggy's talents will help to disprove public stereotypes that Staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed . Adem said: 'A lot of people judge Staffies and think that the breed is dangerous. But this is not true, they are no more dangerous than any other breed of dog. 'Staffordshire Bull Terriers are very intelligent, loving and loyal - but sadly this doesn't stop people mistreating or abandoning them. 'Most rescue centres are filled with unwanted Staffies and they are having difficulty re-homing them. 'The breed gets a lot of negative speculation which definitely does not help the situation and people may not want to adopt them, and as a result many are being put down. If people stopped judging them and started helping them, it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep.'

Patina Welch, 29, from Lyman, told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them, reports\u00a0WMUR-TV. Her son, who was four-months-old, died from his injuries after she landed on him and her now one-year-old daughter was severely injured. Patina Welch, accused of jumping out a second-story window with her four-month-old twins, killing one and severely injuring the other, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . The 29-year-old Lyman resident Patina Welch told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them . A psychiatrist testified last month that Welch was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and was psychotic when she jumped last summer. People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them. The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries.His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July (both babies are pictured here, but not being held by Welch) The attorney general's office says Welch has struggled with mental health problems since she was 13. A dangerousness hearing is scheduled for April 8 - it will determine if she should be committed to the state secure psychiatric ward. If a person has symptoms of psychosis and symptoms of a mood disorder, this diagnosis is given. People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them. Schizoaffective disorder usually begins in the late teen years or early adulthood, often between the ages of 16 and 30. Officials said that on the day before the incident, family and friends told investigators Welch was delusional and paranoid, saying she thought people were trying to hurt her, reports WCVB. Prosecutors say police received a 911 call from a couple in Lyman, a town of 550 people in northwest New Hampshire, reporting their son was in medical distress. An emergency crew responded to Welch's home at 4:50 a.m. on June 18 and discovered that the male infant was in 'medical distress.' The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries. His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July. WCVB reports that the little girl is doing well and now living with family. In June, Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeff Strelzin identified the occupants of the home as Linda Tellier, Trevor McGuire and Welch. He also said McGuire and Welch were the parents of the twins, who were not identified by the attorney general's office. Welch threw the twins out of this window. Welch also jumped out of the window and landed on her son, who died from his injuries . Welch is scheduled for a hearing April 8 to determine if she should be committed to the state secure psychiatric ward .",

He was speaking after the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed it is looking at Met corruption claims from the 1970s to 2005. As questions continued to emerge yesterday about whether other powerful men escaped justice, it was claimed that: . Allegations: It has been claimed that the late Cyril Smith was held and freed seven times over 30 years by police investigating claims he was a paedophile . Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced it is investigating a raft of cover-up allegations against the Met. The 14 separate referrals, which span four decades, indicate the scale of the task police face in getting to the bottom of historic child abuse cases. The allegations include suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations and covering up offences because of the involvement of MPs and police officers. Documents seen by the Daily Mail indicate that up to four serving MPs could be questioned as part of their work. None of the public figures has previously been named publicly in connection with the scandal. It is understood that victims believe they could hold highly sensitive information about their abusers which could help further their inquiries. It was also claimed yesterday that a member of the Queen\u2019s family and an MP were identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry. But the Sunday Mirror claimed the operation was shut down by the Crown Prosecution Service for national security reasons. One former Met officer told the newspaper: \u2018I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed. \u2018The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP. \u2018He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public\u2019s interest because it \u2018could destabilise national security\u2019.\u2019 Separately, further inquiries are being carried out into whether detectives were told to limit a child abuse investigation centred on the former MP Lord Janner. A home belonging to the 86-year-old peer, who was a Labour MP in Leicester for 27 years, was searched in 2013. Last year it was reported that in 1989 a detective sergeant had been told not to arrest Janner or search his home. Earlier this month Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Justice Lowell Goddard to head a public inquiry into historic child sex abuse. The senior New Zealand judge will investigate whether public bodies and other institutions have \u2018taken seriously their duty of care to protect children\u2019. The reformed independent inquiry into child abuse will be able to \u2018compel witnesses\u2019 in a bid to get to the bottom of many difficult and complex claims. On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed how Met deputy commissioner Albert Laugharne claimed he was part of one cover-up. He said that, while head of Lancashire police, he was asked to lie about allegations involving Smith, later unmasked as a paedophile. Sarah Green, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said: \u2018I would like to reassure people our investigations will be thorough and robust.\u2019",

        "article": "A young mother claims she was told by doctors to Google her life-threatening condition after she spotted it mentioned on a doctor's note. Roxanne Stacey was in hospital after having a cyst removed from her ovary. The 24-year-old believed the operation would end the pain, vomiting and exhaustion she had been experiencing for weeks. But as she prepared to leave hospital, she accidentally picked up a handover note meant for other nurses, thinking it was for her. Reading the note when she got home, the mother-of-one spotted the words 'Wilkes syndrome' written in brackets beside details of her cyst removal. Roxanne Stacey, 24, claims she only discovered she had life-threatening illness because she spotted it on a doctor's note - and was then told to 'go home and Google it' herself . Ms Stacey says doctors told her to research her rare illness Wilkes syndrome online after an X-ray confirmed she had the digestive disorder which causes a person to be unable to keep food down. As a result of the illness, she lost seven stone . She called her mother, who researched the condition online, and was horrified to learn it was rare and life-threatening. In those diagnosed with Wilkes syndrome, a major blood vessel in the digestive system lies on top of the small intestine, instead of behind it. It means patients feel full quicker and struggle to keep any food down. If left untreated, it can prove fatal. Concerned, Miss Stacey took the nurse's note to her GP, who Googled the condition in front of her. She claims, he said: 'There's no way you can have this syndrome, you'd be dead by now.' Miss Stacey, from Greenhithe, in Kent, said: 'I felt reassured but the symptoms persisted and I was losing weight by the day.' She was prescribed medication to ease the pain and went for follow-up visits at Darent Valley Hospital. It was an X-ray, taken in January this year, that confirmed Miss Stacey's diagnosis of Wilkes syndrome. After specialists confirmed the illness,  Miss Stacey claims they told her to research the condition on Google. She said: 'To add insult to injury, I was given the diagnosis and told to research it on Google.' Having been unable to digest food properly as a result of the syndrome, Miss Stacey's weight has plummeted to half what it was. Miss Stacey said she was left so weak she was unable to hold her 16-month-old son Freddie, left . 'I look anorexic,' she said. 'I used to be 14 stone and was healthy, and happy. Now I'm 7st 6lbs and I'm too weak for surgery. 'I'm angry that I was left in pain to get on with it when the diagnosis was known in November. 'I'm too weak to hold my 16-month-old son Freddie. 'My partner Alex is taking unpaid leave from his job to help look after him.' Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, referred Miss Stacey to a specialist last month and she said she is now receiving excellent care. She was admitted to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, in London, on March 8 so she can regain some strength and weight before having a life-saving operation. A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We are concerned to hear about Miss Stacey's experience however we have not received a complaint. 'Without being given the opportunity to look into the circumstances around her care, we are not able to respond to her particular concerns. 'If she would like to contact us, we will investigate and answer any questions she may have.'",

        "article": "West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has again criticised referee Mike Dean for his handling of Saturday's London derby defeat by Crystal Palace. The Hammers, currently in ninth place in the Premier League, were beaten 3-1 by the Eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest. Allardyce felt that Palace striker Glenn Murray, scorer of two goals at Upton Park, before being sent off in the 69th minute, should have been dismissed by Dean in the first half for persistent fouling. Glenn Murray was sent off for Crystal Palace during the 3-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Sam Allardyce was frustrated that Murray was not sent off earlier in the game . Allardyce said: 'The biggest problem for me was that Glenn Murray shouldn't have been on the field, not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling. 'Mike Dean, whom I have a lot of respect for, is a very good referee, but he was too lenient with Murray by telling him 'that's your last chance' after the first booking. 'In that particular instance, Palace have been let off. Mike Dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that (Murray) was one of the main reasons why Crystal Palace won. 'And for me that is something disappointing. The fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made, which normally gets a yellow card, and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card. And that is frustrating.' Murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header . Murray got his second and Palace's third when he glanced a header past Adrian . Palace captain Mile Jedinak was caught on Sky Sports TV cameras apparently elbowing Diafra Sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages. Though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials, the Football Association have since charged the player with violent conduct \u2013 and Palace have until Tuesday evening to appeal against that decision. Allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment, saying that the Australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the Senegal striker. He added: 'Jedinak was clearly in a position where Mike Dean couldn't see it. I think about how dangerous it was. It was a very dangerous thing he did. He could have seriously injured Sakho. And he will have to take the punishment \u2013 because I think he deserves it.' Mile Jedinak has been charged by the FA with violent conduct after catching Diafra Sakho with his elbow . The incident went unpunished during the game but Jedinak was retrospectively charged . Elsewhere, in his pre-match press conference, ahead of the visit of Chelsea to East London tomorrow night, Allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with Dave Mackay, the former Tottenham, Derby, Hearts and Scotland enforcer, who died aged 80. Allardyce said: 'I knew Dave. He lived in around Nottingham, when I was at Notts County for three years (1997-1999). I spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football, about management. 'It's a sad day. He was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer. In life, you take a lot of things from a lot of people. 'If you want to get better, you don't just read a book or do a Masters' degree at university; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers.'",

        "article": "Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious \u2018fracas\u2019 with a Top Gear producer on \u2018personal issues\u2019, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was \u2018self-destructing\u2019 and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson\u2019s supporters \u2013 including the Prime Minister \u2013 to those who turned a blind eye to Savile\u2019s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. \u2018I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,\u2019 said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear\u2019s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon\u2019s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking \u2013 and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day\u2019s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon\u2019s position to that of Savile\u2019s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. \u2018The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,\u2019 he said, adding that Clarkson\u2019s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. \u2018If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile\u2019s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.\u2019 The comparison will inevitably anger Savile\u2019s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that \u2018it is not just patently absurd, it\u2019s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile\u2019. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the \u2018fracas\u2019 was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC\u2019s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. \u2018People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,\u2019 said the executive. \u2018This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson\u2026 . \u2018Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.\u2019 Referring to the Top Gear host\u2019s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: \u2018It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. \u2018If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down \u2013 or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. \u2018The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water\u2026 But this is more serious.\u2019 BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One\u2019s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as \u2018mortified\u2019. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows \u2013 including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand \u2013 although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn\u2019t have an expensive steak. \u2018Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn\u2019t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,\u2019 said one source. Others close to the star \u2013 who has been suspended by the BBC \u2013 accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering \u2018off the rails\u2019. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many \u2013 especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive\u2019s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: \u2018This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. \u2018It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. \u2018It\u2019s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.\u2019 Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC\u2019s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a \u2018lazy Irish ****\u2019. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: \u2018You\u2019ll be on the dole tomorrow. \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure you will not have a job.\u2019 The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: \u2018 [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. \u2018He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don\u2019t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. \u2018He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.\u2019 Insiders say the BBC \u2013 which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format \u2013 is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: \u2018You must be freezing.\u2019 The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight\u2019s false expos\u00e9 of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018huge talent\u2019, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left \u2018heartbroken\u2019. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters\u2019 contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight\u2019s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.",

Either Messi or Ronaldo has won the prize on the last seven occasions, with the Barcelona forward winning four, and the Real Madrid star three. But Azpilicueta believes Hazard has the ability  to break the La Liga duo's monopoly and claim the top individual award in world football. Although he maintains his 24-year-old team-mate is more concerned with winning team trophies than individual honours.

The striker, speaking to Marca, said Real are still thinking about the title as well as winning the Champions League having achieved La Decima last season. The France international also welcomed the recent return of Luka Modric, who had been out with a thigh injury since November, and said: 'Modric has been good for us, we\u2019ve missed him.' Karim Benzema has told Marca Real Madrid are still focusing on the La Liga title and Champions League . Meanwhile, Marca claim Atletico are in the market for a left back and could make a move for former defender Filipe Luis who left the Vicente Calderon for Chelsea in the summer.

        "article": "Five men have been poisoned in Japan after allegedly asking a restaurant to serve them banned parts of the world's most toxic fish. The men\u00a0were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of\u00a0Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill. It is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate. Puffer fish account for the majority of Japan's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out, although it is heavily regulated. Government figures show 30 to 50 people are hospitalised every year, with a few of those cases leading to death.",

But these 32 men and women have been arrested on suspicion of being part of a multimillion-dollar scheme to grow massive quantities of marijuana illegally in Colorado and smuggle it out of state. The suspects, aged 25 to 71, were rounded up following an investigation that authorities have called 'Colorado's largest\u00a0marijuana bust' since the drug was  legalized for medical use in November 2000. They allegedly posed as medical marijuana patient caregivers and small business owners over a four-year period while trafficking tens of thousands of pounds of pot out of state, according to\u00a09 News. In high spirits: Tri Trong Nguyen (left) and his wife Kristine Root (right) have been arrested on suspicion of being part of a multimillion-dollar scheme to grow marijuana illegally in Colorado and smuggle it out of state . Grinning: They are among 32 suspects - two more of whom are pictured above - to have been rounded up following an investigation that authorities have called 'Colorado's largest marijuana bust' since 2000 . Accused: The suspects allegedly posed as medical marijuana patient caregivers and small business owners over a four-year period while trafficking tens of thousands of pounds of pot out of state, it is reported .

They are believed to have netted more than a whopping $12million in total by smuggling heaps of marijuana trim, concentrate, and butane hash to Texas, Minnesota and other states, it is said. During the Denver-based inquiry, 4,600 pounds of pot, 2,000 plants and 10 pounds of hash oil were seized by police, the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported. Almost $1.5million in cash was also recovered. This month, Colorado authorities won indictments against the 32 suspects, including Tri Trong Nguyen, his wife, his three sisters and dozens of others.

On Friday, Colorado argued in a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court that states are free to legalize marijuana following a lawsuit from neighboring states asking the court to shut down its pot law. The filing marks the first time Colorado has defended legal marijuana in writing. The federal government did not sue to block the state's 2012 vote to legalize pot for all adults over 21. Colorado said that Nebraska and Oklahoma should sue the federal government for not enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, not other states. Colorado said the states' 'quarrel is not with Colorado but with the federal government's' approach to letting states experiment with pot law. 'Nebraska and Oklahoma filed this case in an attempt to reach across their borders and selectively invalidate state laws with which they disagree,' Colorado argued. Because federal drug law bans marijuana for any purpose, including medical, Colorado argues that blocking recreational pot would also block pot for medical use in 23 states and Washington, D.C. The court has not said whether it will hear the challenge. It has no deadline for doing so. The 32 suspects' charges include violating the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act, illegal marijuana distribution, money laundering, tax evasion, and attempts to influence public servants. They are all now awaiting trial dates in Denver District Court.",

        "article": "(CNN)Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton and teammate Nico Rosberg resumed where they left off last season as the 2015 Formula One season kicked off in Melbourne. The Mercedes duo, who took pole position in all but one of last season's qualifying sessions and won 16 of the 19 races, were dominant in first and second practice for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. Rosberg, who won last year's GP at Albert Park, was fastest around the Melbourne street circuit on Friday, finishing 0.1 second ahead of Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel taking third spot for his new team Ferrari -- the German four-time world champion finished 0.715 seconds off  the pace set by his compatriot. Vettel's Finnish teammate, Kimi Raikkonen was fourth, 1.1 seconds behind the lead with Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Kvyat, who was making his debut for Red Bull since his switch from Toro Rosso, finishing fifth and sixth respectively. \"It was great to be back in the car at this awesome track,\" Rosberg said, the official Formula One site reported. \"Today we have the evidence that our Silver Arrow is quick again and it was a great start for the team,\" he added. \"It seems again that it's very close between Lewis and me and he is a great driver, so I need to nail the setup every time to come out on top. This year will be a big battle again against him, I'm sure. I'm looking forward to the first weekend of the new season with all the great fans out there.\" Hamilton, who was forced to retire from last year's race with engine trouble, was satisfied with his pace. \"It feels great to be back on track and back into a race weekend. In general it's been a good first day,\" Hamilton said. \"Today seemed to confirm that we have pretty good pace. But there are still other quick cars out there and we can't go into tomorrow's sessions not thinking that they will be close.\" The opening day's racing was somewhat overshadowed by an ongoing dispute between Sauber and the Swiss team's 2014 reserve driver Giedo van der Garde. The 29-year-old Dutchman recently started legal proceeding against the Swiss team claiming they had reneged on a promise to make him one of the lead drivers for the 2015 season. Van der Garde won the case held in a Swiss court earlier this month, with the decision being upheld by Supreme Court of Victoria in Australia on Tuesday after Sauber had appealed the original ruling. During practice Van der Garde could be seen in the Sauber garage wearing his race overalls, but he did not make an appearance on track as Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr completing both practice sessions. Following the initial court ruling, team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said that changing drivers hours before a Grand Prix could be dangerous. \"What we cannot do is jeopardize the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers,\" she said, Formula1.com reported. Brazilian Nasr was the highest placed of the two finishing 11th while Swede Marcus Ericsson was 15th. Elsewhere there was also a uncertain start for McLaren who finished way down the pecking order. Jenson Button was 13th, almost four seconds off the pace for the CNN-sponsored team while teammate Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the absent Fernando Alonso, was 16th following second practice. Local favorite Daniel Ricciardo completed just nine laps of practice after his Red Bull suffered engine failure. Qualifying for Sunday's race gets underway on Saturday.",

Put more graphically, if that villa in the South of France you\u2019re looking at costs \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,450) a week to rent, it\u2019s \u00a3231 cheaper than it was in 2014 and \u00a3353 cheaper than in 2010. Likewise, a meal for two in Venice with a \u20ac100 (\u00a372) price tag costs roughly \u00a312 less than this time last year, and \u00a318 less than in 2010. Here are some issues that the better pound/euro exchange rate raises \u2013 but remember that if you use cards to get cash out of overseas ATMs, settle hotel and restaurant bills and make purchases, the actual exchange rate won\u2019t be quite as good, due to the banks taking commission. Holidaymakers may get a better deal by booking direct, in euros, as most prices were fixed last year . Book direct? Most holiday companies will have fixed their prices with hoteliers and villa owners last year, when the pound was weaker against the euro. This means you may well get a better deal by booking direct, in euros. That said, I know of a number of operators and villa agencies that have recently lowered prices to take into account the better exchange rate, and tailor-made arrangements may be based on current exchange rates. So it\u2019s worth doing DIY vs package price comparisons. Also bear in mind that you get better financial protection and back-up when you book a package. If you do book direct, to be sure of benefiting from the current good exchange rate, you need to pay in full now rather than putting down a deposit or paying on arrival/departure. The rate may be even better in a few months\u2019 time, but of course it may have worsened. You could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now . Buy euros now? The pound was worth about \u20ac1.40 a week ago, but by Friday it had fallen slightly. No one knows what it will do next, so if you buy euros now, you\u2019re taking a gamble. But you could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now. Consider doing so with a pre-paid euro currency card \u2013 the exchange rate used will be whatever it is on the day you upload the funds. The Ukash Travel Money MasterCard (ukash.com) has very competitive exchange rates and charges no fees for making purchases or cash withdrawals. A driving holiday on the Continent? The combination of more favourable exchange rates and lower oil prices means that filling up the car in eurozone countries is costing British motorists a lot less than a year ago. According to a Post Office Travel Money report, when converted into pounds, the price of a litre of unleaded petrol in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria is down year-on-year by at least 20 per cent. In many European countries, fuel is also markedly cheaper than in the UK \u2013 about 10p less per litre of unleaded in France than in the UK. Prague is an attractive destination for Britons as the Czech koruna has plummeted against sterling . Beyond the eurozone . Exchange rates have also improved significantly for British travellers heading to some European countries outside the eurozone. Notoriously expensive Scandinavia is looking more affordable. Compared with this time two years ago, the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona are about 25 per cent weaker against the pound. You might also want to consider a break to Prague: the Czech koruna has plummeted over 20 per cent against sterling since spring 2013. But if you\u2019re thinking of heading to the US this year, things are not looking so rosy. The strength of the US economy means that the pound is weaker against the dollar than at any time since June 2010. Worth a paltry $1.47 on Friday, the pound has dropped by more than ten per cent from 12 months ago \u2013 bumping up accommodation and day-to-day costs. Bear in mind that it\u2019s not just in the States where the strong dollar is making things pricier for British visitors. The same is true in other holiday spots where currencies are pegged to the US dollar, such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua in the\u00a0Caribbean, and Dubai.",

        "article": "Animal behaviour experts had warned that this morning\u2019s eclipse could make owls more alert, sheep feel sleepy and change the flight of moths. And while some animal lovers have taken to Twitter to describe how their cat \u2018went nuts\u2019 or dog looked confused, some say pets and farm animals didn\u2019t react at all to the astronomical phenomenon. The partial eclipse saw skies across the UK darken at around 9.30am as the moon travelled in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. Scroll down for video . The partial eclipse saw skies across the UK darken at around 9.30am as the moon's orbit saw it travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. This image shows the partial eclipse in Penzance, Cornwall . Before the event, Dave Clarke, Head of Invertebrates at ZSL London told MailOnline: \u2018A solar eclipse, especially a full eclipse, could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation.\u2019 While the zoo had prepared by amending the lighting slightly in Butterfly Paradise, it said that in the end, it was \u2018pretty underwheming\u2019 with no strange behaviour seen. An expert from ZSL London told MailOnline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies (an owl butterfly is shown) This may be because the skies of London were grey and cloudy. The Royal Zoological Society Scotland said there was also no unusual activity at Edinburgh Zoo either. However, many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted. RizkeyG in Staffordshire, tweeted: \u2018It went cold and dark and the wind changed. There were no birds flying, then they started to tweet again in the trees. Brilliant #eclipse\u2019, while Robert Thompson said: \u2018Eclipse is weird even though cloudy the sky has almost a lilac haze, the birds have gone and the wind has stopped eerie out there.\u2019 Kitty Gallannaugh in London said: 'It's just kind of dusky flat light here and all the birds have gone silent. It's eerily peaceful!', to which Laura Amy replied: 'There is a hazy feel to everything, no birds flying and no wind at all! Very eerie.' Donald Broom, Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare at the University of Cambridge, told MailOnline earlier this week that the most people would notice that many of the common birds stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer. 'Farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night,' he said, before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks, they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on,\u2019 he added. A Twitter user called \u20acva said: \u2018It's REALLY calm. No animals make sounds out there. It's STILL, like NATURE is holding its breath. :-) #eclipse The mood is ODD\u2019 and Yvonneridley tweeted: \u2018Animals on farm are acting a bit weird #eclipse\u2019. The path of totality for Friday's eclipse travelled from just beneath the Greenland peninsula to the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March travelled over Europe . Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory. \u2018They'll notice it will get dark,' he said before adding: 'Although night happens every day, you don't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning, so it's a bit disturbing for them.' He predicted that dogs would probably be more alert and pay more attention to what's going on around them more than usual because they will be 'slightly surprised'. There were reports of pet dogs howling and running around on Twitter, although Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London \u2018saw absolutely no changes in behaviour in our animals\u2019. Kat Williams tweeted: \u2018Did anyone else's animals get proper weird over the eclipse? Rachel [a dog] was chewing the armchair & generally acting like a little weirdo, to which Jason A Leaman replied: \u2018Our hens went to bed!\u2019 Zoos in London, Chester and Edinburgh said that animals did not behave particularly strangely during the eclipse, but these lemurs at Chester Zoo, seem to be admiring the strange sight . Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory, however, this dog waiting for the event with its eclipse glasses on, looks quite relaxed . The eclipse saw up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse was visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. This suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle  reacted more strongly but this is hard to prove . Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of \u2018night-time\u2019. For example, sheep (stock image) may find a place to sleep tomorrow . Projection:\u00a0Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen \u2013 giant sheet of white paper works \u2013 a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. However, other pet owners were underwhelmed by their animals\u2019 response to the partial eclipse. Hand Troleman in Aberdeen, where the eclipse was meant to be more striking, tweeted: \u2018Not gonna lie was expecting more from the eclipse: total darkness, folk walking into lampposts, animals howling, the end times being upon us and Pokusevski's, a deli in Salford said: \u2018They say animals can feel solar eclipse. Don't think my cats are bothered,\u2019 along with a picture of two ginger cats relaxing. Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told\u00a0Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of \u2018night time\u2019. She said: 'Diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night: sleep! \u2018Dragonflies hide under a leaf, ants return to their nest, sheep walk back to their sleeping place, cattle egrets (heron-like birds) return to their nocturnal roost, diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop.\u2019 \u2018Nocturnal animals become active: owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on.\u2019 It was also predicted that bees may become more active during the partial eclipse, based on a study conducted in India. Experts at the Zoological Survey of India studied rock bees during an eclipse in June 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon, 150 bees buzzed out of a hive, instead of the normal 25 or so, The Atlantic reported. \u2018It would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th June, the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active,\u2019 ML Roonwall, who led the study said. During a partial eclipse in 2001, desert cicadas in Arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling,but there have been no reports that similar insects like crickets, did the same in the UK. Birds were reported to go silent during the partial eclipse, like the crow shown above in Bridgwater, Somerset . Many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted. Here, a group wear protective glasses as they watch the partial eclipse in Madrid . Experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse\u2019s shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy, it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication. In 1973, researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse. In the study, the animals increased the length of this \u2018non-stop running sessions\u2019. During a 2001 solar eclipse in Africa, self-proclaimed eclipse chaser, Todd Thompson witnessed strange animal behaviour in Zambia. RizkeyG in Staffordshire, tweeted: \u2018It went cold and dark and the wind changed. There were no birds flying, then they started to tweet again in the trees. Brilliant #eclipse\u2019 A stock image of a blackbird is shown . \u2018Nocturnal animals become active [during an eclipse]: Owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on,\u2019 one expert said . He said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened, crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished. Paul Murdin, visiting professor of Astronomy at Liverpool John Moores University, collected observations from 250 members of Wildlife and Environment Zimbabwe (WEZ) during the same eclipse. He wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river, unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended, there was a \u2018crescendo of loud dawn chorus-like calls\u2019 from turtle doves, after they had fallen silent though the event. \u2018By contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared,\u2019 he wrote.",

        "article": "Arsenal's exit from the Champions League last 16 for the fifth consecutive season on Tuesday has once again exposed the limitations of Arsene Wenger's unbalanced squad. The Gunners came close to making Champions League history by becoming the first team to reverse a two-goal deficit from home but fell just short in their 2-0 victory at the Stade Louis II. Here, Sportsmail identifies nine players in three key areas - goalkeeper, defensive midfielder and centre forward - that could transform the north London side from fading challengers to serious title contenders... Danny Welbeck helps Santi Cazorla off the ground after Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League . Arsene Wenger needs to spend in the summer to address shortcomings in several key areas . Read how Arsene Wenger has gone almost two decades in the Champions League without winning the prize with Arsenal . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: \u00a320m . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. The \u00a320m price tag is too high and you get the impression for any other club Cech would cost less. The figures and Cech's age will act as a deterrent for the normally cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, if Cech's experience prevented Champions League quarter-final, first-leg displays such as the one against Monaco it's a deal worth considering. Petr Cech has a cut a disconsolate figure after losing his place to Thibaut Courtois this season . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says second choice Cech will only leave Stamford Bridge for 'huge money' BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: \u00a312m . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience despite his age, having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely even imagine.' Bayer Leverkusen stopper Bernd Leno has impressed Arsenal scouts and is open to a move abroad . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: \u00a316m . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Mattia Perin has been tipped to become 'the next Gianluigi Buffon' and is also wanted by Liverpool . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . LARS BENDER . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: \u00a322m . Arsenal have considered moves for Bender over the past few seasons and his injury record plus Leverkusen's reluctance to deal has stalled discussions. This season has been one of his best however and he is back in their thinking. Only problem is he is now also on the lists of Manchester United and Barcelona, who want him when their transfer ban is lifted next January. A stylish and strong player who could add much-needed discipline to the squad. Germany midfielder Lars Bender has been a long-term target but Bayer Leverkusen are reluctant to sell . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: \u00a330m . The favoured choice of Arsene Wenger, Schneiderlin is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked certain players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Mauricio Pochettino could prove an obstacle but Champions League qualification may be the key. Arsenal are expected to resume their chase for Southampton holding midfielder\u00a0Morgan Schneiderlin (left) The France international has emerged as one of the Premier League's best midfielders in recent seasons . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: \u00a330m . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience at domestic and international level. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy is an unexpected name who could shore up the centre of Arsenal's midfield . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: \u00a320m . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal the edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone is now said to be strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic (left), being replaced by Fernando Torres, has fallen out of favour at Atletico Madrid . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: \u00a325m . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 26 goals in 28 games despite a run of just two in his last four. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. The 23-year-old Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette has scored 26 goals in 28 games this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: \u00a335m . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was keen to join prior to David Moyes departing. He split from his agent and is now looked after by his brother. All the Premier League big guns have been contacted and Arsenal are interested although the cost and wages would be high. Other options exist such as Palermo's Paulo Dybala but he is keen to stay in Italy. PSG striker Edinson Cavani would bring goals but comes with high wages and an expensive price tag . The Uruguay striker was part of the PSG side that sent Chelsea out of the Champions League .",

        "article": "Labour and the SNP are 'half way down the aisle' to stitching up a deal to put Ed Miliband in Number 10, the Tories claimed today after Nicola Sturgeon dropped the party's red line over nuclear weapons. Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would still be prepared to put Mr Miliband in Downing Street even if Labour refused to scrap Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent \u2013 a key plank of the nationalists' manifesto. The Scottish First Minister said the SNP would never vote to renew Trident but she insisted there were 'many issues we could agree on'. Ms Sturgeon played down the prospects of a formal Coalition, but said the SNP could prop up a Labour government 'on an issue-by-issue' basis. Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP could still do a deal with the Labour Party even if Ed Miliband insists on renewing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons . She said: 'On that basis, there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for Trident.' Ms Sturgeon's remarks, to the Guardian, come amid growing pressure on Mr Miliband to rule out going into Coalition with the SNP in a bid to stem the party's loss of support in Scotland. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Ms Sturgeon's move opened to door for a deal between Labour and the SNP after the election. He said: 'Ed Miliband and the SNP have signed the pre-nup and are now half-way up the aisle. 'Day after day, vote after vote in Parliament, Ed Miliband would be forced to negotiate with Alex Salmond - the man who tried to break up Britain - about how to run Britain. 'Make no mistake: an Ed Miliband government, propped up by the SNP, would mean more debt than our children could ever hope to repay, higher taxes on hardworking people and economic chaos for our country.' A Labour government propped up by the SNP - handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10 - moved a step closer after Nicola Sturgeon dropped a red line over Trident nuclear weapons . Scotland will be able to 'call the tune' at Westminster after the general election, according to Alex Salmond. The former First Minister, who is standing for the Gordon constituency in May, said neither Labour or the Conservative 'are fit to govern' and believes a large group of SNP MPs will lead to 'progress for Scotland'. Working with Plaid Cymru and the Green Party, Mr Salmond hopes to 'shake Westminster to its foundations, to rumble up the House of Commons'. Speaking ahead of a constituency meeting in the village of Insch, Aberdeenshire, he said: 'It is now clear that neither Tory or Labour will win an overall majority. Neither are fit to govern. 'It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament. 'Now thoughts should turn to what that tune should be. Nicola Sturgeon has laid out a clear strategy and key priorities. 'We cannot give any support formal or informal to the Tories because of their track record of hostility to Scottish interests and the total bad faith of David Cameron towards the Scottish people the day after the referendum. 'However, support for any other administration comes with the conditon of progress for Scotland. 'Progress to fully deliver the promises on real powers that were made to the Scottish people during the referendum. Progress to signal an end to austerity economics with all the damage that this is doing to the country and finally common sense progress in stopping the waste of countless billions on new nuclear weapons.' It comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in Scotland revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP could see Labour lose almost 40 seats north of the border. The survey, by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, showed the SNP could win as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats \u2013 up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives would end up being tied on 272 seats each \u2013 well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. But a Labour government could be propped up by the SNP \u2013 handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10. However, Labour's Scottish MPs are urging Mr Miliband to rule out a deal with the SNP ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party's dire poll ratings north of the border. Scottish Labour is holding its annual conference in Edinburgh this weekend. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has also warned Labour against doing a deal with the SNP. Sir John claimed 'the SNP would enter into any agreement with Labour with one overriding aim: to break up the United Kingdom'. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'Labour now have to make a choice. 'They must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent. The British people \u2013 north and south of the border \u2014 do not deserve to be misled. Labour must remove any doubt. 'If the outcome of the general election is inconclusive, will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the United Kingdom?' The SNP said that Labour would 'not be forgiven by the people of Scotland' if they refused to work with the Nationalists. Deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'For a former Tory prime minister to tell Labour what to do on the eve of their conference in Scotland is hugely embarrassing for (Scottish Labour leader) Jim Murphy. 'John Major wants the Tories to be re-elected in May, and therefore he wants Labour to rule out an agreement with the SNP, because that would stop the Tories.' 'There are no circumstances in which the SNP would put the Tories into government - the question is if Labour have the same commitment, with a number of senior Labour figures promoting voting Tory in Scotland, and even the idea of a 'grand alliance' between the Tories and Labour.",

Bringing the fun back into the job, however, are officers with the Reykjavik police department, who are raking in followers via social media for their hilarious photos from the line of duty. It is not surprising that Iceland's capital has one of the lowest crime rates in the world - with the fun photographs showing officers finding the time to dress as Star Wars characters, play with kittens and feed wild geese. Scroll down for video . Reykjavik police have fun on the job and share their experiences on their popular Instagram account . Officers show they have a sense of humour, as they pose as Darth Vader and a Stormtrooper . An officer welcomes the newest member of the police force in Reykjavik . Reykjavik's police department has more than 133,000 followers on its social media account . The police department has been winning over followers by the thousands with cute snaps like this one . From reading stories to children to doing handstands in the snow, the police department's Instagram account reveals a human side to its officers for its 133,000 followers. It has long been debated why the crime rate is so low in Iceland with data from the UN in 2011 showing the homicide rate between 1999-2009 never climbed above 1.8 homicides per 100,000 residents on any given year. This is compared to the US where rates were between 5.0 and 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people. An officer dons a red nose, and another flashes a peace sign with 'Je suis policier' written on her fingers . Instead of huddling from the cold, the officers embrace the snowy weather by doing handstands . Posing in a police car, these female officers show that the job is not all strict rules and boring duties .

The posters advertised low-cost flights to Germany and appeared in numerous tube carriages as well as on platforms. The company asked for them to be taken down almost immediately after the incident, which killed 150 people. Adverts for Germanwings with the slogan 'get ready to be surprised' are being removed from the London tube network following Tuesday's crash . The adverts, which have a picture of an air hostess as well as images of popular German destinations, said: 'Get ready to be surprised. Visit Germany. 'Enjoy the variety of Germany and fly to e.g. Berlin or Hamburg.' A Transport for London spokesman confirmed they were taking the posters down as quickly as possible. They said: 'Our advertising department was contacted by the company and asked to remove the adverts on Tuesday. 'We had 65 digital adverts that were taken down within an hour. 'We are in the process of removing larger sheet adverts at 17 stations. Five have already been removed and another ten will come down today.

Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out the of the cockpit before deliberately forcing the plane to descend, French prosecutors revealed yesterday. In audio files extracted from the plane's cockpit voice recorder - discovered on Wednesday at the remote crash site - the captain was heard growing increasingly distressed as he tried to force his way back into the flight deck.

Lufthansa said the aircraft was carrying citizens of 18 countries. Three Americans and three Britons were confirmed among the victims. Lubitz had been receiving psychiatric counselling right up until the crash, it emerged today. As well as having been signed off from training with depression in 2008, it was reported this morning that Lubitz had been continuing to receive mental health support.

The businesswoman and mother-of-one is getting set to open the rose gold doors to her first UK blow dry bar, Show Dry, this weekend in London. Keen to hear her well-placed haircare tips and put the swanky service to the test, FEMAIL joined Tamara (and baby Sophia) at the glossy Westbourne Grove salon - and it certainly lived up to expectation. Scroll down for video . FEMAIL's Martha Cliff, left, and Bianca London, right, joined Tamara Ecclestone, centre, at the launch of her new blow-dry bar, Show Dry, a swanky but affordable new salon in West London . Speaking to FEMAIL, the Formula One heiress and founder of Show Beauty (her luxurious haircare range) explained that the salon combines sumptuous interiors, the service of sleek designer boutiques and exclusivity of private members clubs. She said: 'As a working wife and new mother I know how hard it is to look and feel great when you don\u2019t have much time and Show Dry aims to provide a slick, time efficient service that allows all women the time to feel fabulous no matter how much time you \"don\u2019t have\". Speed is everything to me these days.' Martha Cliff, pictured, left, before, and, right, after, had never had a blow-dry before so tested out Tamara's \u00a335 signature and felt like a Disney princess . Bianca London, pictured, left, before, and, right, after, was really impressed with how speedy the service was and how healthy her hair looked and felt afterwards . The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect the best of everything. Each station is kitted out with an iPad, which is filled with magazines (to prevent clutter), hair inspiration snaps, a healthy menu (almond milk latte, anyone?), and  even a personal driver service courtesy of Uber to protect newly styled hair. 'My home was the inspiration, this could be in my house,' she said of the opulent surroundings. 'The ceiling was inspired by the range's packaging and the rose gold and black is very on brand; I wanted it to be an extension of what I already started.' Despite the swanky surroundings, getting your hair styled a la Tamara will only set you back between \u00a318-\u00a345. The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect the best of everything, including a ceiling inspired by the packaging of her hair range .

        "article": "Five years ago England beat Spain to win the Under 17 European Championships. The winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box, between two opponents, before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper. A cool finish on a big occasion. A few months later, I saw him come on as a substitute in the Championship and display some clever touches and neat footwork. He stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game. Fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the Championship - picked up the ball in his own half, ran towards the opposition goal, beat two defenders, wrong-footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net. Connor Wickham made a disastrous decision to move to Sunderland when his career was flying . In the Championship, he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch . Two weeks after that he scored a hat-trick. In the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move. He signed for Sunderland. To those who didn't follow Connor Wickham's career before he went to the North-East, all they will know of him is that he is highly-paid, and not exactly outstanding. Sure, there was a flurry of goals to help Sunderland stay up at the back end of last season, but that has been it. Stories emerged last season of his big spending - \u00a317,500 on a gold bottle of champagne, and a \u00a3140,000 Ferrari. These barely make a dent in his \u00a360,000-a-week salary, and they look cheap compared with team-mate Steven Fletcher and his \u00a3260,000 Lamborghini parked next to his \u00a3160,000 Bentley. These underachieving Sunderland players don't mind showing off their wealth, do they? Stories have emerged of Wickham's extravagant spending - \u00a317,500 on a bottle of champagne, for example . In a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer . Is it something about the club that means these players have no self-awareness whatsoever? Is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they're so truly terrible on the pitch, it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch? One of Wickham's managers called him 'a playboy model,' and said he needed a 'slap in the face' to help him realise his talent. And make no mistake, Wickham is a very talented footballer. Unfortunately he chose the wrong club. Since Wickham joined Sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level, including his loan spells. That is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish. Managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge, so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted. Wickham should be spearheading England Under 21s' Euro campaign but he has not been selected . The 21-year-old has been stuck out on the left for Sunderland when he is clearly a centre-forward . At a more stable club, the chances are that Wickham might have a better environment to succeed. On the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward. That's where he did so well at the end of last season. Off the pitch, has the so-called 'playboy model' been guided properly? Evidence suggests not: Gus Poyet even admitted he ignored Wickham when he first arrived at the Stadium of Light as manager. He revealed he didn't even sit down and talk to the player. Sunderland signed Wickham but their duty doesn't stop there. They need to provide that player with every chance to succeed. Hopefully stability will reign at the Stadium of Light in the near future, Wickham will get the right guidance off the field, and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field. Sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but Wickham has not been guided . Sunderland are a basket case of a club and Wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them . Five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the European Championship for England I am disappointed Wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier this week. Even more worrying, repeated pull-outs from the Under 21 squads mean he's way down the pecking order, even with injuries this week. He should be spearheading our charge to the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer. The ongoing debate about English talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like Wickham. All the ability, but no significant strides made. He should have made that progression. The fact that he hasn't is down to Sunderland being a complete basket case of a club. Let's hope for Wickham's sake \u2013 and England's \u2013 the next chapter for Sunderland will help him become the player he should be.",

Lake Tapps, which was flooded in 1911 to power a hydro-electric dam, swallowed up four and a half square miles of countryside, including an old railway line and parts of a forest. The images, taken last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, also shows discarded items which have been lost in the lake, which is now used for recreation. Scroll down for video . Revealed: This old wooden railway trestle was unveiled by a draining operation at Lake Tapps, near Seattle, Washington . Emptied out: Local authorities started emptying the lake to enable repairs to be made to a nearby dam. In usual conditions the above homes jut out onto the water . Authorities in the Seattle area drained the lake this winter to relieve pressure on the nearby dam, which had developed a crack. The lake was first formed when the Puget Sound Energy energy company filled the area with water to generate electricity. It stopped producing power in 2009 and has been used for fishing, boating and other waterborne activities since. The maintenance project has now been completed, according to Bonney Lake Courier-Herald, and the lake is being refilled. The process is expected to be finished at the end of May. Abandoned: Bits of junk, and items like this CD, were also uncovered by the lake-emptying project . Underwater forest: These tree trunks have been sitting under the water for the 104 years since the area was flooded .

        "article": "U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm. The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the expos\u00e9 from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments. But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days. The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex \u2013 even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated \u2013 can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.' The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.' 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . TROUBLE IN COLOMBIA: Drug Enforcement Agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money . NARCO-PERVS: DEA agents had Top Secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers . 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.' Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates. In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.' One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors\u2019 group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.' 'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD\u2019s honor.' 'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.' In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action. A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments. In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves. The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years. Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.' Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns  while they were indulging in the hooker-fests. They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.' Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade. 'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called \"tolerance zones\",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' ANGRY:\u00a0'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz . The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors . The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report. In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States. Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed. 'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote. When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance. A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception. An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report. His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'

        "article": "Health experts have accused Coca Cola of \u2018health washing\u2019 consumers with the launch of its new \u2018lower-calorie\u2019 soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult\u2019s recommended daily allowance of sugar. The soft drink giant\u2019s latest product, Coke Life, is partly made from a naturally sweet plant called Stevia, in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers. But a 330ml can of Coca Cola Life still has 22g of sugar, equivalent of six teaspoons and 89 calories. When compared to a 330ml can of regular Coca Cola which has 35g of sugar, equivalent of almost 10 teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories, that is 35 per cent less sugar. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults of normal body mass index only eat 25g (six teaspoons) of sugar in total per day. University of Sydney nutritionist Dr Kieron Rooney told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018Coke Life should not be considered a healthy option\u2026 it should not even have a seat at the table. \u2018This is health washing, yes it is less sugar than the original but that is still an excessive amount - it is still a sugar sweetened beverage and is no way part of a healthy life or lifestyle.\u2019 Coca-Cola Life (left) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular Coca-Cola (right) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar . Dr Rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution, a saccharin [artificial sweetener] solution and only drank a certain amount. But when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would. \u2018It\u2019s called a super mix, a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption\u2026 if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for Coke\u2019s profit line,\u2019 Dr Rooney said. Coke Life has its very own \u2018super mix\u2019 of both sugar and Stevia - a type of sweetener. \u2018Coke will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health,\u2019 Dr Rooney warned. When it comes to the green colour of the Coke Life packet it can give off a \u2018healthy vibe\u2019, Dr Rooney said. He noted Coke would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in London in September . \u2018There would have been some work that went into the association of green with health. I can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product. \u2018But people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits,\u2019 he said. Dr Rooney explained that \u2018liquid calories\u2019 are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food. \u2018If you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories,\u2019 Dr Rooney said. The best drinks to consume are water and milk, he advised. And when it comes to Coke\u2019s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic, Dr Rooney said it is \u2018disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate for Coke to frame their products as healthy.\u2019 Dr Rooney said it is 'disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate' for Coke products to be marketed as healthy . Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . Sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth, increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist, he explained . \u2018I think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight, which is absolutely wrong.\u2019 Dr Rooney explained that 'liquid calories' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food . Professor Amanda Lee of Queensland University of Technology, and former chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Dietary Guidelines Working Committee, told the Sydney Morning Herald the launch of Coca Cola Life is an example of \u2018greenwashing\u2019. \u2018It reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes. I'm worried, it's trying to make a product that's intrinsically unhealthy, healthy,\u2019 she said. \u2018There's a high risk that many consumers could be confused, thinking that it's a low-energy option when it's not.\u2019 The product, which hit Australian shelves on Monday, has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke because it doesn\u2019t use artificial sweeteners like Aspartame. Lisa Winn, Coca-Cola South Pacific Marketing Director, said: \u2018Coca-Cola Life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands. \u2018We\u2019re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for. We\u2019ve achieved the taste you\u2019d expect from Coca-Cola with 35% reduced sugar and kilojoules, compared to Coca-Cola.\u2019 \u2018Coke Life isn\u2019t simply a new product from Coca-Cola \u2013 it\u2019s another great choice for people who want a delicious Coca-Cola to fit their lifestyle. There is a Coca-Cola option for everyone,\u2019 she said. It is only the fourth drink to be launched in the Trademark\u2019s 128-year history. Peach flavour Lipton Ice Tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar, while Vitamin Water has seven . V Energy Drinks which promise to give you 'energy' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them . The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola. Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories \u2013 you will still find 27 in a can. However, it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar. Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages. The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies. However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it. Coke Zero (left) is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate 'diet' drinks with women. Unlike Diet Coke (right), which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar . Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life. 'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets. Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained. You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home \u2013 or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA. FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns. 'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion. 'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that\u2019s we\u2019d still agree.' If you\u2019re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives. Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health. One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer. However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola has continued to use it. Powerade has over eight teaspoons of sugar and Gatorade has nine teaspoons . Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier \u2013 but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke. 'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn\u2019t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,\u2019 Ms Hourigan said. Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage. Rival soft drink brand Pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses Stevia as a sweetener in some markets. They have named it Pepsi Next.",

        "article": "A sour appearance on business competition show Shark Tank actually ended in success for start-up founder Jesse Genet. The 27-year-old taped this past year, pitching her company Lumi which sells DIY kits to print custom designs on T-shirts, bags, and other surfaces. But the shrewd angel investors on the show refused to bite at Genet's offer of a 5 per cent stake in her company for $250,000, believing she was overestimating the worth of the business of $5 million. Scroll down for video . The pitch: Jesse Genet, CEO of DIY screenprinting company Lumi, failed to get an investment when she appeared on Shark Tank in a recent episode . Empty handed: The sharks felt that the 27-year-old's valuation in her company was too high and she refused to compromise on lower offers . Success: Shortly after the episode was taped, Genet applied for and was accepted into leading Silicon Valley start-up incubator Y Combinator . Shark Kevin O'Leary estimated that she was only taking back $100,000 in profits after taxes and found the $5million valuation a little aspirational. 'That\u2019s 50 times your free cash flow - It\u2019s ridiculous,' he said. O'Leary and fellow shark Laurie Greiner offered Genet an alternative deal, based on a much-lower valuation of her company, but Genet refused to budge, leaving the show empty handed. As she ended her bargaining with the sharks, Genet remained positive saying: 'I'm going to make this into a credible company'. And it appears she was right. Just one month after her episode aired she has already doubled her profits. Shortly after taping the show, Genet applied for and was accepted into Y Combinator, one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious start-up incubators. She joined the incubator in December and in just three months has increased her profits to $2.5 million by expanding her product line and redesigning her website. '[The comments] were dicey, but I can handle that,' Genet told Business Insider. '[Shark Tank] helped us realize what was really big about our business and what was not scalable.' On Tuesday, she presented her company at YC's biannual Demo Day, showing off a whole new line of products not shown on Shark Tank - including custom stamps. On the right track: In three months at Y Combinator, Genet has doubled her sales to $2.5 million. Above, photos show how Genet's patented printing technique works . Genet started her business three years ago, after finding a method for printing on natural surfaces with a negative film, developed my an inventor in the 1950s. Genet spent two years trying to track down the inventor, and ended up convincing him to sell her the trade secret formula for $50,000. Kickstarter helped her raise $270,000 to get the business started, and now her product is sold in retailers like Michael's.",

Rihanna was seen strolling through the Palace's luxurious rooms during the late night shoot, while wearing a glamorous sequin gown - and a pair of fluffy slippers.

        "article": "A police force has been accused of putting a  sex offender's 'human rights' before public safety after officers admitted they were trying to trace a missing individual but refused to reveal their name or gender. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed a person convicted of sex offences has disappeared from the Bolton area and could be anywhere in the UK. But despite a Freedom of Information request, the force is refusing to name the missing pervert or even say whether they were a man or a woman, bizarrely claiming the information was 'personal'. Greater Manchester Police have admitted they are attempting to trace a missing sex offender but will not release the name or gender of the individual . Yesterday MPs and locals in Bolton blasted GMP for their rigid stance - claiming it is a hindrance in actually finding the missing offender. Furious Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said the police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules'. Ms Hilling said: 'These are people who are not fulfilling their legal duty but their human rights mean information cannot be released. 'It is no wonder they have disappeared and cannot be found.' Police say they don't name victims to ensure their safety. If a sex offender was named and attacked by vigilantes they may try to sue  under article 2 of the 1998 Human Rights act which protects 'any person from unlawful violence'. Angry Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester's police and crime commissioner, said human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders. He said he has spoken to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to ensure everything was being done to locate the missing offenders. Anger: Julie Hilling, MP for Bolton West, said\u00a0police were offering protection to offenders who have 'broken the rules' He said: 'Where necessary and appropriate, police should enlist the help of the public. 'Human rights legislation was never intended to protect registered sex offenders who choose to go off the grid. 'It should never be the determining factor when police consider if they should release an offender's details. 'The police must retain the option to name people who may represent a danger to the public.' GMP initially refused to confirm the exact details of 23 missing sex offenders from their area - citing the risk of identifying individuals. Requests under Freedom of Information laws were refused, but police later disclosed that one offender from Bolton was missing after it was appealed by locals on the grounds of public interest. A police spokesman said routinely naming sex offenders could endanger them or lead to the identification of victims. Instead they said naming them was a weapon they only liked to use as a last resort. He added: 'If individual registered sex offenders are believed to present an imminent risk, then they can be named in the media.' Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said there were 2,700 registered sex offenders in Greater Manchester, with more than 600 subject to Sexual Offences Prevention Orders. He said: 'A large proportion of the recorded missing/wanted sex offenders are either known or believed to be living abroad or have returned to their country of origin. 'Of the 23 registered sex offenders registered in GMP whose whereabouts are currently unknown, 11 are strongly believed to be abroad and checks are in place should they return to the UK. 'The remaining 12 are subject to periodic reviews and enquiries in order to trace them and all are circulated as wanted.' Police justified withholding specific information about the missing offenders because it was 'personal' and would increase the risk of identification. Shoppers in Bolton expressed their frustration and anger that more information about who the missing person is has not been forthcoming. Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders . Local resident Clare Cooke, 32, said: 'How can the public assist detectives if we don't know who he or she is? It's crazy. 'I would be furious if I later found out the person moving in next door to me was a wanted, convicted sex offender.' Cafe worker Karel Popovic, 26, said: 'Police show pictures of other wanted men and women so why is this different?' Earlier this month, freedom of information requests were sent to every police force in the UK to find out the number of missing registered sex offenders. Scotland Yard said the whereabouts of 167 registered sex offenders were unknown and the longest period of time an offender had been missing was 14 years, the force said. Cheshire Police refuse to name a missing registered sex offender - over fears of a vigilante attack saying one registered sex offender was missing but refused to say when their whereabouts became unknown. Merseyside Police said three registered sex offenders were missing, as of March 3, and all three had gone missing this year.",

        "article": "(CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus,\" which airs on Sundays. I also appear in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the latest episode, \"The Gospel of Judas.\" Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Yalanda M. Price: What do scholars know about the man named Judas? What is his story? Mark Goodacre: Judas is actually a pretty mysterious figure in the New Testament. In fact, the relative lack of information about him in the Gospels has provided the invitation, across the centuries, for people to speculate about who he was and what could have possibly motivated him to hand Jesus over to the authorities. We know very little about his back story from the Gospels. He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. In John's Gospel, he is the disciple who is concerned about Mary wasting money anointing Jesus (John 12.4-6). Soon afterward, he is arranging to hand Jesus over to the authorities. His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died (Acts 1.18-19). Mark Goodacre answers your questions about the Shroud of Turin . Kristine Spillman Adams: My understanding was always that Judas betrayed Jesus not because he was a villain, but he thought Jesus would start an earthly war when arrested. He was trying to get Jesus to establish a literal, physical kingdom on Earth. Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries of the last week of Jesus' life. What motivated Judas to betray Jesus? John hints that it was financial greed (John 12.6), and Matthew says that he betrayed Jesus for \"thirty pieces of silver\" (Matthew 27.14-15). It is true, though, that many have speculated that Judas may have been some kind of zealot or freedom fighter, and he has often been depicted in this way in film and fiction. With this theory, he was trying to force Jesus' hand. It has sometimes been said that perhaps the word \"Iscariot\" is a corruption of the word \"sicarii,\" which means \"dagger bearer,\" and that would provide some backing to that theory. However, John identifies Judas as \"Son of Simon Iscariot\", which makes the \"sicarii\" theory less likely. In the end, we may have to accept that we simply will never know the answer to the question about Judas' motivation. Candida Moss answers your questions about John the Baptist . Betsy Wilson-Roark: Are you confident that you now have all of the pages and the current translation is accurate? Are there still words or phrases that are missing or ambiguous? Goodacre: That's a good question. Well, we probably have as much of the Gospel of Judas as we will ever have. Several additional fragments of the Codex Tchacos, in which the Gospel of Judas is featured, came to light after Bruce Ferrini, the dealer who owned the codex for some time, went bankrupt. Now, it is estimated that we have something like 90% to 95% of the text. With regards to translation and interpretation, this process will continue for years to come, as it always does with newly discovered ancient texts. I think the original translators in 2006 did a sterling job, all the more so as they were working with an incomplete, damaged and very complex Coptic text that had been lost for centuries. But I also greatly admire April DeConick's important contribution and the key adjustments in our understanding of the Gospel that this has brought about. I was delighted to see both the earlier and the newer interpretations of the Gospel of Judas dramatized so effectively in \"Finding Jesus.\" Amarylis Didley West: Is there a place that we can find and read the Gospel of Judas? Goodacre: The National Geographic website on the Gospel of Judas does feature the original translation from 2006. As far as I am aware, there is no online version of the newer edition featuring the newer fragments and the revised translation. Watch the latest episode anytime on CNNgo . NJ Robinson: Good question would be did Jesus know Judas would betray him when/before he chose him? Goodacre: The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus (more accurately \"hand him over\") as soon as they introduce him (e.g. Mark 3.19), but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of the historical Jesus are what makes the story so compelling for writers of historical fiction. If you would like to read more about Judas, a good starting point is provided in this article on the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey website.  It is written by \"Finding Jesus\" contributor Bruce Chilton. And if you would like to read more about the Gospel of Judas, \"Finding Jesus\" contributor April DeConick discusses it on Bible Odyssey.

A car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Richard Burbage, 41, of Whiteley, Hampshire, then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument. The father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined \u00a3320 for attacking Julian Raffle. Burbage had been arguing with his wife, Lorraine, in KFC after they had been to a football match on a Sunday afternoon. The row erupted because Burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him. But when she discovered the meal meant being taken to KFC in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing. Dan O\u2019Neill, prosecuting, told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row. He added that customer Mr Raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened. Mr O\u2019Neil said there was then a struggle between Mr Raffle and Burbage - and the  car dealer twice tried to punch him. But what he did not realise was that Mr Raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when Burbage tried to upper cut Mr Raffle, he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows. When the wife discovered she was going to KFC (above) in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing . Burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault. After admitting this at Southampton Magistrates\u2019 Court, he was fined \u00a3200. He also had to pay \u00a3100 costs and a \u00a320 victim surcharge. A separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on November 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. Mark Rigby, defending Burbage, said: \u2018He and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty, fiery and passionate. \u2018What he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because Mr Raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu. \u2018With hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this. She was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and wasn\u2019t pleased to find out that that meal would be at KFC. \u2018I think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife.\u2019",

        "article": "David Cameron reacted angrily to a Tory minister's warning against banning hate preachers . David Cameron reacted with fury after a Tory minister warned against banning radical preachers from universities during a fiery Cabinet meeting, it has been revealed. The Prime Minister 'jumped on' the universities minister Greg Clark after he spoke out against Home Office plans to force universities to ban non-violent 'extremists', sources said. Mr Cameron was backed up by the Home Secretary Theresa May and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. The extraordinary row comes after it emerged Mrs May is at loggerheads with the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable over the issue. The Home Office wants all campuses to become no-go zones for all 'extremist' speakers to prevent students becoming radicalised. But Mr Cable insists that the move could force debates 'underground', where extreme views will go unchallenged. Last month's Cabinet row suggests the issue is dividing the Tory Party as well as the Coalition. The issue has come to the fore after the unmasking of Mohammed Emwazi \u2013 a University of Westminster graduate thought to be the ISIS executioner known as Jihadi John. Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006, and just days before Emwazi's identity was revealed, thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak. Former students at the university have claimed it is a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11'. Former University of Westminster pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi. New laws passed by the government put a legal requirement on universities to prevent terrorism. Mrs May insists this should include barring people with extreme views from speaking on campus.\u00a0But Mr Cable, who is responsible for university policy, warns a blanket ban on radical preachers could backfire. Scroll down for video . Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and the Universities Minister Greg Clark are at loggerheads over a clampdown on extremism . The Univeersity of Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 . A source close to the Business Secretary said: 'There are of course cases when banning is justified but as long as speakers don't invite terrorism - which is illegal - there are times when it's better to demolish extreme views through open debate and challenge. 'If the default option is to ban outright, there is a chance the debate will happen anyway outside the campus in an uncontrolled 'underground' environment, with no challenge to extreme views at all.' But Mrs May said : 'If colleges and universities didn't realise before what we are up against, they should know now. We're not talking about regulating legitimate debate \u2014 we're saying they need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus.' Since news of Emwazi's connection with ISIS in Syria broke, the Westminster University's Islamic Society has distanced itself from having any involvement. Mohammed Emwazi - the Islamic State militant known as 'Jihadi John' - studied at the University of Westminster . Tory party chairman Grant Mr Shapps accused the Lib Dems of blocking attempts to crack down on radicalisation. He said: 'Yes there is a difference of opinion. Vince Cable doesn't want to do what Conservatives want to do which is that on campus we don't want radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people. 'We have seen these three girls go off to Syria, we have seen Jihadi John, we don't want think that sort of preaching should happen in our universities. 'I'm afraid to say that Conservatives just have a simple view that people in Vince Cable's constituency of Twickenham or around the country deserve that protection and that means we have to put proper, decent, tough rules in place which don't ban free speech but do stop people from preaching death.' The University of Westminster has hit back at claims it is a fertile breeding ground for Islamic fundamentalism as arguments rage over who is to blame over Jihadi John. Kuwait-born Londoner Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. Responding to claims from a fellow former student that the university allowed extremism, a spokesman for the institution said: 'We condemn the promotion of radicalisation, terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community. 'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations.' There was also a renewed suggestion - from a former independent reviewer of government anti-terror laws - that Emwazi might have been prevented from joining up with IS had restrictions on suspects not been relaxed. 'Had control orders been in place, in my view there is a realistic prospect that Mohammed Emwazi, and at least two of his associates, would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation,' Lord Carlile said. 'If that had been the case, he would not have done what he's done in recent times,' the Liberal Democrat peer added.",

        "article": "(CNN)Police in Charlottesville, Virginia, will publicly discuss on Monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a University of Virginia student, which was initially reported last year in Rolling Stone magazine. The police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party. The accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the Rolling Stone article. After the account was published last fall, Rolling Stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details. CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter described Rolling Stone's announcement as falling short of a full-scale retraction. It remains unclear what really happened to the female student, Stelter said. \"We are in the phase here where Rolling Stone is trying to figure that out,\" Stelter said in December. \"They've apologized, but not retracted. So they're not saying the story is false. They're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still.\" The Charlottesville Police Department will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. ET on Monday. Rolling Stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly \"orchestrated the attack on 'Jackie' (the woman who was the subject of the article) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,\" a decision the magazine said it regretted. \"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,\" Rolling Stone said in December. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that \"the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story.\" University of Virginia pledges zero-tolerance in rape cases . The article chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault. It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN that is proved by email and fraternity records. Warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser's account. For example, the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity, the fraternity house has no side staircase, and there were no pledges at that time of year. Jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on, asking, \"Don't you want to be a brother?\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Melissa Gray and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.",

The family of a California mother accused of killing her 20-day-old son who was found dead under heavy brush have said they are standing by her. Samantha Green, 23, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday, three days after her son, Justice Rees, was found dead in wetlands in Knight's Landing near the Sacramento River. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by\u00a0CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Frank Rees, Green's partner and Justice's father, also said he was standing by his fianc\u00e9e. 'I will stand by her side through all of this,' he told KXTV. 'I know that she wouldn't intentionally hurt that baby. If there was some sort of accident or something that either she's not remembering or that she feels ashamed of or guilty about, she knows I'll forgive her.' Tragedy: Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing. She told authorities that they had been abducted . Support: Samantha's father Randy (pictured) and mother Laurie, said they were standing by their daughter because they know that she would never intentionally hurt her baby whom 'she loved very much' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fianc\u00e9 [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote.\u00a0'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villase\u00f1or then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough,\u00a0News 10 reported. Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Scene: Crews can be seen looking through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body . Scene: Investigators flagged the spot where Justice's body was found by search crews on Wednesday . Police arrived around 5.30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Traverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush. Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am on Wednesday. A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough'. An autopsy is underway to determine the cause of his death. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. On Saturday, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto announced at a press conference that Green had been arrested and would be charged with murder. The district attorney has yet to decide what degree of murder she will face. 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child,' Prieto said. Prieto did not give any information as to why they decided to charge Green, but did say that authorities were not able to substantiate claims that she had been abused. Staying by her side: Green's partner and Justice's father, Frank Rees (pictured right) is supporting her . 'She made comments about she was there for so many hours screaming and hollering,' Prieto said. 'We were able to determine that perhaps (that) didn't happen.' He said that Green and her baby son had been the only two in her car, and added that authorities did not have knowledge of anyone else being involved. She is being held without bail at Yolo County jail. After police identified Justice's body on Wednesday, the family spoke of their heartbreak. 'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, with whom the young couple and their son had been living. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed. 'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know. This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'

        "article": "To most eyes she was just a little girl doing no harm to anyone as she made her way to school with her father. But to the local police, Sophie Lindley was a law-breaking menace... because she was riding her bicycle on the pavement. An officer stopped the four-year-old and threatened to confiscate the purple bike, which is fitted with stabilisers, if she did not get off and walk. Scroll down for video . Left in tears: Sophie Lindley had been cycling with stabilisers on the way to school in Grantham, Lincolnshire . 'Daft': The girl's father Dale Lindley (pictured) had to carry his daughter, who was now in tears, and her bike . Sophie, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, was wearing a helmet and her father Dale was holding a lead attached to the bicycle as she rode to school. They had paused to feed the ducks when the policeman warned her it was against the law to ride on the pavement. Former soldier Mr Lindley, 34, said: \u2018At first I thought he was joking but he looked deadly serious. \u2018I said, \u201cYou must be kidding. What do you want me to do, make her ride on the busy road? It\u2019s rush hour.\u201d \u2018He just shrugged and said, \u201cShe must get off the bike and walk and I\u2019m going to sit here and make sure you don\u2019t put her back on it. If you do, I\u2019ll confiscate the bike.\u201d I was gobsmacked.\u2019 The officer kept watch as they began the one-mile walk uphill to West Grantham Academy St John\u2019s school. When Sophie arrived at school she was in floods of tears, Mr Lindley said. Traumatic experience: By the time Sophie was in school, 'she was so upset a teacher had to calm her down' \u2018The poor thing thought she was going to be put in jail. I\u2019m absolutely outraged that a policeman can act in this way. Surely the police have better things to do than pick on parents taking their kids to school?\u2019 Sophie\u2019s mother Emma Stephenson, 33, said: \u2018When Dale came home and told me what had happened I couldn\u2019t believe it. \u2018How on earth is my daughter riding her little bike with stabilisers to school a criminal offence? Surely there needs to be some common sense applied. \u2018You can\u2019t expect a four-year-old to ride in the road \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly safe. \u2018I am trying to teach her that they [the police] are friendly. Now that has all gone out the window.\u2019 Lincolnshire Police have now apologised to the family, admitting that common sense should have prevailed, but Sophie\u2019s parents are considering making a formal complaint so no other child is treated in the same way. 'Absolutely outraged': Mr Lindley (left) said his daughter Sophie 'thought she was going to be put in jail' 'Unbelievable': Sophie's mother Emma Stephenson (above) accepted it was illegal to ride on the pavement, but added that it was 'ridiculous to think a four-year-old is not allowed . Cycling groups criticised the officer\u2019s actions. Roger Geffen of CTC, the national cycling charity, said: \u2018Everyone lets their children ride on the pavement. It is perfectly normal and not criminal.\u2019 A CTC spokesman said: \u2018A four-year-old child should be encouraged to cycle and not be deterred. It is good exercise and gives them a sense of independence. Police officers should use their discretion \u2013 this child wasn\u2019t causing any danger or distress.\u2019 Cyclists are told in section 64 of the Highway Code that 'you must not cycle on a pavement' - which is backed up in law by section 72 of the Highway Act 1835. The penalty for cycling on the pavement is a fixed penalty notice of \u00a330 under section 51 and schedule 3 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. However, children under 10 cannot be charged with committing a crime, although they can be given a local child curfew - an overnight ban from being in public without an adult. Last year cycling minister Robert Goodwill told police that cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road. He urged police to remember official guidelines from 1999 which state that fines are not aimed at those using pavements out of \u2018fear of traffic\u2019, provided they show consideration for pedestrians.",

It froze relations with the country  19 years ago until it reformed areas such as human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. Now the two sides have agreed to intensify the pace of talks which began in 2014 aimed at improving bilateral relations, the EU's foreign policy chief has said. Reconnect: The European Union hopes to a deal to restore relations with Cuba and its president Raul Castro (pictured) by the end of 2015 after cutting ties with the country back in 1996 . Negotiations: EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (left) held talks with Cuba's president Raul Castro and high-ranking officials (pictured) 'Slow progress': Ms Mogherini said the EU wants to finalise the framework for an agreement between the two bodies by the end of 2015 . Federica Mogherini said the pace of progress was 'slow' but  it was gaining 'political momentum' after meeting with Cuban president Raul Castro and other high-ranking officials in Havana. She said: 'We decided today to speed up the rhythm of our negotiations, hopefully to manage to finalise the framework of our dialogue and agreement by the end of this year. The negotiations they began last April were seen as part of an improvement in relations since the 28-nation bloc lifted diplomatic sanctions on Cuba in 2008. But only three meetings took place in the next 11 months, prompting the Europeans to quicken the pace which Cuban officials agreed to. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez will now visit . Mogherini in Brussels on April 22 and like the EU chief's trip to . Havana, the meeting will fall outside of formal negotiations. Between now and then they will also see each other at the .

Cuba has also begun to engage in talks with the . United States after the former enemies announced they would restore diplomatic relations in December. Relations between the countries are still strained but they have improved drastically since Fidel Castro stepped down as leader of Cuba and Barack Obama became president of the United States. After assuming office, Obama said he was open to scrapping the trade embargo if Cuba underwent political change and in 2009, he eased some economic sanctions on the country and eased travel restrictions too. Cuba's president Raul Castro reciprocated Obama's policies and in July 2012 he said his government was willing to hold talks with the United States to 'discuss anything'. They two leaders famously shook hands at former South African president Nelson Mandela's state memorial service. The United States and Cuba quickly arranged high-level . meetings in Havana and Washington, while EU-Cuba talks were . postponed twice. Though not as severe as the open conflict between the United .

        "article": "A London-based property agency is promising to find those seeking a house-share the perfect flatmate, with just two small conditions woven into their contracts; they must be young...and they must be rich. The owner of Capital Living, based in the city's South-West, Adam Goff, describes his unique flat-sharing process as 'a selective living community for people who want to meet new people' which might translate as 'hooking you up with posh flatmates, but only if you're posh yourself'. Indeed Goff, 30, offers more than just a room in one of his 22 properties, mostly Victorian terraces in places such as Clapham, Balham and Fulham. A room to rent with 'cool friends' as part of the package: Adam Goff, 30, founder of Capital Living aims to hook up 'young and rich' professionals in his flatshares across South West London . Do you come here often? All of the Capital Living properties come with open-plan kitchens to encourage flatmates to chat more freely . For an average flat-fee of \u00a31,050 a month, tenants can rest assured that their fellow flat-sharers will be somewhere between the ages of 21 to 39 with a flourishing career, often in the City, and a definite predisposition for partying. Those who have seen the lives of London's richest youngsters in hit television show Made in Chelsea are looking for something similar but don't always know how to get it, says Goff. He told the\u00a0Times newspaper: 'I don\u2019t think you have to be posh to deal with us, but young and rich is probably a fair assessment.' The owner describes the set-up as a 'social experience' and says young professionals in London often need 'someone to sit and watch TV with, go for a beer with, have a takeaway with' when they get home from a hard day at the office. Each property comes with a gas barbecue and a communal kitchen space. The company treats potential tenants - or 'members' as they call them - as if they were looking for a membership at an exclusive club such as Soho House with couples banned for fear of killing a flat's sociable atmosphere. They face an interview process at the company's Clapham offices to see whether they 'would fit with our community'. Welcome to the community! Capital Living founder Adam Goff regularly throws parties for new tenants. The photo above shows 'members' during a night out at London's Kensington Roof Gardens . A cartoon on the company's website tells the story of how Mr Goff was inspired to start his flat-share company by a miserable, friendless experience when he first moved to London from Birmingham . Going solo: Couples are banned from renting rooms in the houses for fear they'll dampen the party mood . Parties, often a landlord's worst nightmare, are actively encouraged with new tenants, often who've never lived in London before, invited to the get-togethers. A recent night out saw Goff, his three-strong team of employees and a raft of their tenants enjoying the charms of West End nightclub Mahiki, a favourite with Prince Harry. Does he not worry about the potential for damage? He tells FEMAIL: 'We take a security deposit from our members, in much the same way a letting agent would. 'The reality is that our members are earning their own money and therefore understand the value of money and respect our property and importantly each other. The nirvana of London living for twentysomethings? Flats come with modular sofas, communal kitchens and a gas barbecue in the properties' gardens . Chloe Smith has lived in Capital Living properties for two years and says they are good value . Chloe Smith, 25, works in publishing and has lived in Capital Living properties for two years. Originally from Poole in Dorset, Chloe   says that she was cynical about the 'flat-fee rent' at first but was soon won over. Currently sharing a flat with three others in Balham, she says she loves the fact that the company houses like-minded people together. 'I spotted the ad on the website Spareroom.co.uk and thought it might be a scam at first...it sounded too good to be true. 'Flat-hunting in London is a nightmare so I went for it and actually it's been brilliant. I actually think the rent is great value because lots of things are included that you'd probably pay extra for elsewhere. 'I've met some really good friends, a couple who will probably be friends for life and I even introduced my flatmate to a friend and they're now dating. 'Every house-share has annoying people but so far, bar one guy who left pretty quickly, I've liked everyone that I've lived with.' 'In fact, this is a large reason why people choose to live in our community. Of course there is the occasional house party but there is little chance of things getting out of hand because everyone has work on Monday morning and if there is a bit of mess the house goes back to normal after a good clean from our cleaning team!' Goff says that a lonely experience when he first moved to the city following a university course in Birmingham prompted him to start the company with \u00a316,000 in savings. Although the flat-fee service is around \u00a3300 more expensive than your average room rental in, say, Clapham, it's a room that comes with a built-in social life plus a weekly cleaner and boring domestic essentials such as dishwasher tablets. One such tenant who says the agency is a perfect fit is Robert Hart. Living in leafy Balham with three flatmates, the investment banker totally buys into the 'social living' idea and used the company to find not just a place to live but an instant social circle. 'I moved to London from Worcestershire,' he says '...and I wanted to broaden my social circle.' He describes the experience so far as having a 'built-in social life'. Although Goff's tenants are almost all at the beginning or mid-way through what promises to be a glittering career, he's less accepting of 'trust-funders'. 'Young people need to earn an honest crust,' he says, although he's not averse to fretful parents paying the rent while their offspring find their way in the big smoke. Goff says they've had no real problems with unruly tenants to date with expectations at the interview process 'high'. He says: 'In six years we have never had to evict anyone, have we asked people to leave or not allowed them to renew? Sure, but not for anything to write home about. 'Our members are professionals and have too much going for them to do anything that would risk their careers.' Capital Living will be shown on E4 later this year .",

The Gunners set up a semi-final meeting against either Reading or Bradford thanks to a 2-1 win over 10-man United at Old Trafford. Former United striker Danny Welbeck returned to haunt Van Gaal by scoring the winner after Wayne Rooney had equalised Nacho Monreal's opener. Premier League referee Michael Oliver shows Angel di Maria a red card during FA Cup clash at Old Trafford . Di Maria was shown a second yellow card after pushing Oliver shortly after receiving a yellow card . Manchester United summer signing Di Maria trudges off the Old Trafford pitch after his dismissal . The main talking point from the match was the latest episode in what has been a largely disappointing start to Di Maria's career at Old Trafford. After being cautioned for simulation, the former Real Madrid midfielder remonstrated with referee Oliver and then grabbed the back of his shirt and yelled at the official when he had turned his back on him. Replays showed the first booking on Di Maria was harsh and Aaron Ramsey had pulled the player back, but the \u00a360million man's actions thereafter deserved sanction, according to Van Gaal. 'I think he's touched the referee and that's forbidden in every country, so he has no excuses,' the United manager said. 'In Spain he knows that he doesn't touch the referee, but that is also in his emotion. 'I've already spoken with him, he knows my opinion but also I have to see on the video.'",

Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national,\u00a0lied his way into casinos he had been banned from by producing fake ID cards and driving licences. Once inside, the unemployed 61-year-old\u00a0would sit at card tables for hours, deftly making marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. Sentenced: Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, would sit at casino tables for hours deftly making the marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands. He was jailed for 18 months today . The technique allowed him to swindle the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London out of \u00a343,400 in just one week. Lacatos was arrested at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton, in March 2014 after staff recognised him and raised the alarm. After his arrest, Lacatos attempted to flee to Romania from Luton Airport but was caught in the departure lounge by detectives on 20 November 2014. He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court today. His conviction is the one of the first for \u2018card marking\u2019 - a technique which is thought to have made the skilled fraudster hundreds of thousands of pounds over his six-year spree. Lacatos fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham. Lacatos, pictured bottom right at a card table in Playboy Club in Mayfair, London, used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years . He used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years. The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: \u2018The defendant is a well-known casino cheat. He is known to mark cards at three card poker thereby causing loss to operators across the UK. \u2018To facilitate his entry into the various casinos, knowing he had been previously banned from such establishments, the allegations behind the fraud in this case are that he used false names to register with the various casinos supporting his applications with counterfeit documentation on every occasion.\u2019 Scam: The bends and dents, pictured, helped Lacatos identify what other players at the table were holding . She added: \u2018Over the week of using the false identity at the Playboy Casino in London, it was discovered that the defendant had cheated at three card poker by bending or marking the cards. \u2018The cards were notably aces and this bending of the cards enabled him to know when the card were being dealt. \u2018The CCTV showed that the defendant noticeably increased his bets of \u00a310 to \u00a320 to \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per game. \u2018CCTV also showed that the defendant always sat at the first box position which is nearest to the shuffle machine at the card table. Lacatos spent hours sitting at casino tables for making tiny marks and creases in the cards. He would always sit at the first box position, which is nearest to the card shuffle machine and the table. This seat meant he was given the best possible view of the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle. The poker player would then watch carefully as the pack was dealt, noting the creases or marks which revealed which card it was. \u2018This ensured he could clearly see the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle,\u2019 she said. \u2018He was able to take a sum of \u00a343,400 from the casino in total. That figure includes winning his bets back and the profit made by cheating. \u2018As a result of these findings the matter was reported to the police, the packs of cards were handed over and were analysed and were found to have been marked. \u2018That caused further enquiries to be made and an investigation showed that the defendant had been involved in various other incidents around the UK and had gained access to various casinos by using further false identities.' Lacatos\u2019 placed bets worth \u00a325,200 at the Playboy club and won them all back plus a profit of \u00a318,200. Ms Fawcett continued: \u2018Between 29 March 2014 and 31 March 2014 he joined the Northampton Rubicon casino again with a false identity. \u2018He was recognised in that casino however on the 31 March 2014 - the police were notified, they arrested the defendant in the casino.\u2019 Lacatos was cautioned and later bailed to return to Charing Cross police station for a full interview with an interpreter. But he failed to attend and offended  twice more while on bail. Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than \u00a340,000 . \u2018The defendant was finally arrested on 20 November 2014 at Luton airport whilst about to leave the UK on a flight to Romania,\u2019 said Ms Fawcett. Police seized \u00a33,500 from Lacatos who was carrying his own passport and ID card at the time. Stuart Stevens, for Lacatos, said the married cheat was from the \u2018very, very poor\u2019 region of southern Romania. Lacatos has simply printed bogus Hungarian and Romanian identity cards from the internet and laminated them. \u2018He tells me there is not a big check at casinos - they want your money so they let you in,\u2019 said Mr Stevens. \u2018He realises his time of making this money is over, he wanted to get back to Romania, to his family. He appreciates just how serious this is and he throws himself on the mercy of the court.\u2019 Sentencing Lacatos at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Alexander Layton QC said Lacatos \u2018deliberately planned\u2019 his crimes and used a \u2018large number\u2019 of false names. \u2018After you had been arrested you attempted to flee the country, two of the offences were committed while you were on bail and you have previous convictions in Romania for offences relating to false identity documents,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have pleaded guilty to 18 counts - all of which were related to a campaign of cheating in casinos up and down the country over a period stretching back some six years.\u2019 Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim\u2019s Casino also in London. He also fleeced customers at the Rank Casinos in Leicester, Stockport, Salford, Swansea, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Sunderland, Birmingham, Walsall and London premises in Victoria and Bayswater.",

        "article": "It's an argument that has plagued most households at least once, but now the age-old question of whether toilet paper should sit under or over the roll has finally been solved. How? By a 124-year-old patent from 22 December 1891 which clearly illustrates an 'over' arrangement for toilet paper. Writer Owen Williams discovered the toilet paper patent online, and wasted no time in sharing his new-found information with his 8,000 followers on Twitter. The in-depth patent created by New York businessman Seth Wheeler clearly shows an 'over' arrangement . The patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets, New York business man Seth Wheeler. Wheeler, who was also the owner of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Sheet Company, undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way. Included in the patent, are Seth's declarations on his new product: 'Be it known that I, SETH WHEELER, of the city and county of Albany, and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toilet-Paper Rolls.' Although there's no specific mention of the 'over' arrangement of the toilet paper, the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use. And it's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated; it's the state of the entire bathroom. Other key things to consider? Cleanliness. Etiquette expert William Hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit 'over', other bathroom tidiness is important: \u2018I very much judge a house, and the house owner, by the state of their guest bathroom. \u2018I would question the hygiene of the person's kitchen if the loo wasn\u2019t spotless upon arrival. Finally, the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved . \u2018My own facilities for guests are half bathroom, half temple. \u2018There\u2019s no streaky chrome, or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester. \u2018If a guest doesn\u2019t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then I feel I have failed as a host; so many over-worry about their food, spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack, tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint, when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the Harpic.\u2019",

        "article": "Young teenagers are happier and healthier now than teenagers were a decade ago, a new study said yesterday. It found that the \u2018Facebook generation\u2019 of youngsters are less likely than their predecessors to drink alcohol, smoke tobacco or cannabis, or get bullied. A growing proportion of 11 to 15-year-olds, the study said, engage in behaviour that would make their parents proud. They eat fruit and vegetables, take exercise, clean their teeth, and talk to their mothers and fathers. Adolescents are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables, take exercise, talk  to their mothers and fathers . However the study, assembled by academics at St Andrews University, complained that despite the increasing levels of health and well-being, adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the generation of the 2000s. Obesity rates, it said, did not decline between 2002 and 2010. The findings, based on a series of papers put together with the help of the World Health Organisation, are the latest to underline the increasing trend for teenagers to avoid risky behaviour in favour of a healthier lifestyle. In England and Wales teen pregnancies have fallen to levels last seen in the 1960s and official surveys have shown a major drop in drinking among young people. More than a quarter of under-24s are teetotal and fewer than a fifth ever go binge drinking, according to 2013 estimates. in 2013 tobacco smoking among young women aged 18 to 24 dropped by 10 per cent, and among young men by almost as much. State surveys also showed a major drop in 2013 in numbers of people in the same age group who took any illegal drug, down from 19.3 per cent to 16.3 per cent. Some researchers have pointed to a \u2018Facebook effect\u2019 which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets in their bedrooms. Widespread public disapproval of smoking, drunkenness, drug abuse and teen mothers is also likely to have influenced teen behaviour. Professor Candace Currie of St Andrews, who assembled evidence drawn up from surveys and official statistics carried out in Europe and North America, said: \u2018There is much to celebrate about the health and well-being of many young people today.\u2019 The study, assembled by academics at St Andrews University (pictured), said that despite the increasing levels of health and well-being, adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the previous generation . She added however that \u2018others continue to experience real and worrying problems.\u2019 Some countries, including Scotland, showed evidence that fewer youngsters took daily exercise in 2010 than in 2002. The report said that while the overall optimistic picture seems surprising, considering that many countries faced a severe economic crisis in the last decade, policies and actions to improve public health were implemented in many countries in the same period. Many of those policies were, however, deeply controversial. Some researchers have pointed to a \u2018Facebook effect\u2019 which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets . Critics of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, launched in England by Tony Blair, have said that it had nothing to do with the fall in teenage pregnancy, which did not become evident until after David Cameron\u2019s Coalition scrapped the programme of contraceptive distribution in 2010. Yesterday\u2019s report added that \u2018the general feeling that young people are better off today could also be attributed to changes in fashions, behavioural norms and societal values.\u2019 Professor Currie said: \u2018Adolescence is a crucial stage in life when you lay the foundation for adulthood, whether that is healthy or otherwise.\u2019",

        "article": "Captain Edwin Tritschler (pictured) \u00a0is accused of forging the signature of a Lieutenant Commander on documents after being accused of bullying . A high-ranking officer in the Royal Navy 'deceitfully' forged the signature of a Lieutenant Commander who accused him of harassment and bullying to 'protect himself from future complaints', a court martial heard today. Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, of Yeovilton in Somerset, is accused of forging the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill on documents to bring an end to the 'never-ending' list of complaints against him. He is accused of using a scanner and a computer to help forge Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. The court heard the forged documents were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department that he had given clear management advice to his junior. They also heard the pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were both working on-board HMS Illustrious in July 2007, when it was based in New York. Captain Tritschler thought Lt Cdr Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard. Meanwhile, Lt Cdr Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'. Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy. Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler, who was then a Commander. Captain Tritschler denies three counts of forgery. David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'The accused, Captain Tritschler, is a man of previous impeccable character. 'In 2007 and 2008 he was the head of air engineering on HMS Illustrious. In July 2007 the complainant, Lieutenant Commander Bovill, was transferred to HMS Illustrious, which was the first ship he had served on. 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship. 'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying. 'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service. The pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were working on HMS Illustrious (pictured) in 2007 . 'In February 2008 Lt Cdr Bovill submitted a complaint and a decision was reached but Lt Cdr Bovill was not happy and asked for it to be taken to the next level.' The court then heard Captain Tritschler allegedly forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill and the documents bear signatures of both men. 'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner. 'There is no dispute that these signatures are forged. The dispute is whether Captain Tritschler is responsible for them. 'The prosecution's case is that Captain Tritschler only ever had the documents and the idea that someone else infiltrated them is fanciful. 'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does. The court heard how when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'. Mr Richards said: 'Lt Cdr Bovill made mistakes, however he felt these were dealt with in an unacceptable way by his superior, the accused, who he accused of humiliating and undermining him.' 'On February 21, 2008, Lt Cdr Bovill submitted his first complaint of bullying (regarding Tritschler's behaviour).' When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, Lt Cdr Bovill reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed. In interview, Cpt Tritschler denied forging the signatures and said he remembered Lt Cdr Bovill signing them in his presence. Mr Richards said: 'He insisted the documents were signed in front of him. 'The prosecution's case is that it was Captain Tritschler who generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.' Lt Cdr Bovill today told the board: 'Our relationship significantly deteriorated. I know that I made mistakes in how I went about my professional business. 'But I wanted to submit a complaint about the behaviour I was receiving. I thought he had a very abrupt and blunt manner with me.' Captain Tritschler denies three charges of forgery and the trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

'When they come back to playing in Europe they may have a considerable amount of injures in certain areas and mental fatigue kicks in on players - that is bound to have an effect when other teams have had the opportunity to take a break.' Swansea boss Garry Monk hailed the entertainment level of the Premier League but believes English clubs still lack the tactical nous of their continental counterparts. Everton are the only Premier League club still standing in the Europa League . Swansea boss Garry Monk says Premier League clubs should be doing better in Europe . 'I've always said the Premier League is the best league in the world but more so for entertainment rather than technical and tactical situations in countries like Spain,' he said. 'The Premier League is the best league in that it is the most entertaining, highest tempo, most ferocious and so much happens. 'Whether we need to improve on the tactical I'm not sure but we've got some of the best managers in the world in this league. 'It is very fine margins at that level as games are won and lost by one or two moments in a game. 'Looking at those players in those Premier League teams you think they would do better in those competitions. So I'm not sure if it's one of those seasons or if there is a fundamental problem.'",

Vladimir Putin yesterday honoured the man Scotland Yard believes poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko with polonium in London. Andrey Lugovoy, 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko. Putin had blocked the extradition of Lugovoy, a former secret-service operative who is now an MP with the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. The Russian president also gave the Order of Honour to Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya. The award came as Kadyrov admitted knowing the man who has confessed to killing Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. Kadyrov appeared to defend the suspect Zaur Dadayev by calling him a 'true patriot' and a 'deeply religious man'. Opposition politician Ilya Yashin said Putin was sending a signal: 'These are my people, do not touch them.' Kadyrov received his state award for 'work achievements, strenuous social activities and long conscientious service', but it comes amid claims that even some senior Russian officials are worried about the sway held by the Chechen. Lugovoy holds the post of deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's security and anti-corruption committee. He is chief suspect in the murder of former secret agent Mr Litvinenko, who from his death bed accused Putin of ordering his killing. Putin revealed yesterday that he held an all-night conclave of his defence and secret services cardinals ahead of his order last year to restore Crimea to Russia. In a trailer for a new TV documentary, he admitted calling his security chiefs to the Kremlin for a secret meeting to order them to save the life of deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Andrey Lugovoy (pictured), 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko . The Russians allege the West was complicit in the toppling of pro-Moscow Yanukovych so threatening Russia's national security. 'I invited the leaders of our special services and the defence ministry to the Kremlin and set them the task of saving the life of the president of Ukraine, who would simply have been liquidated,' said Putin. 'We finished about seven in the morning. When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, \"We are forced to begin the work to bring Crimea back into Russia\".'",

        "article": "His father was one of Italy's most notorious fugitives and dubbed 'The Tractor' on account of all the people he had mown down. But now, an American travel company has sparked outrage by recruiting the son of former mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano to give talks about his father's criminal life. Angelo Provenzano, 39, is now earning a living from talking to holidaymakers in Palermo about his childhood on the run after being signed up with the Boston-based Overseas Adventure Travel. Angelo, the son of mafia boss\u00a0Bernardo Provenzano, is earning a living discussing his father's life to tourists . The notorious 'boss of bosses' was eventually captured after being caught in a farmhouse in April 2006 . A poster from 2005, a year before he was caught - Bernardo spent 43 years on the run before he was caught . His father, now, 82, is serving a life sentence for mafia crimes, including his involvement in the murders of the magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. He spent 43 years on the run before being arrested in 2006 near his birthplace of Corleone, the name immortalised in The Godfather Hollywood movies based on Mario Puzo's books. He is said to have carried out 40 murders himself and ordered the deaths of at least 120 others in a career spanning more than 60 years after he joined the mob as a teenager. When the then chief Totto Riina was captured in 1993, Provenzano eventually became the 'capo di tutti capi' ('boss of bosses') of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Overseas Adventure Tour offer on their website 'an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia' But furious campaigners have denounced the move by the travel company, describing it as a story that 'still drips with blood'. Dino Paternostro, an anti-mafia campaigner from the Provenzanos' home town of Corleone, told the Times: 'I don't know what Angelo Provenzano tells the tourists, but I'm sure he doesn't tell them of the unspeakable acts of violence committed by Cosa Nostra and by a ferocious boss like his father. 'His performances may be building up negative heroes, who dramatically reduce the perception of the dangerousness of the mafia phenomenon.' Maria Falcone, the sister of the murdered anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, said: 'It's true that the sins of the fathers should not fall on the sons, but it's not right to exploit the mafia, a story that still drips with blood.' A group called Addiopizzo, set up to provide support for people in Sicily forced to pay protection money, has been left outraged by the revelations. Dario Riccobono, from the organisation, told the Guardian: 'He's the son of the most famous mafia boss in Sicily, the director of the worst period of slaughter in the Italian mafia. 'It's clear that a person can't pay for their father, no one's asking for him to go to prison, but if he wants a normal life he should act in a certain way.' The mafia boss, pictured in 1963, when an arrest warrant was issued against him and (right) in 2006 after he was finally captured . The brother of Giuseppe Impastato, also known as Peppino, was a political activist who opposed the Mafia, which ordered his murder in 1978 - campaign groups have condemned the move by the travel agent . The talks take place at the Hotel Opera Plaza, in Palermo (pictured) and take place on the third day of the 15-day trip to Sicily offered by Overseas Adventure Travel . Bernardo Provenzano was born on January 31 1933 in Corleone, a Sicilian town synonymous with mafia activity (and which gave its name to the fictional family in the Godfather films). He is said to have joined the mafia in his late teens, after the Second World War. In 1963, as he rose up the ranks, Provenzano went on the run when an arrest warrant was issued against him for the murder of one of his rival's (Michele Navarra) men. Over the next five years, Provenzano helped his ally Luciano Leggio hunt down and kill many of Navarra's surviving supporters. In 1974, Leggio went to prison, leaving Toto Riina in charge with Provenzano his right-hand man. Riina was captured in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. Provenzano took the helm. During his time as a fugitive, he corresponded with his family via 'pizzini' - small pieces of paper - instead of taking the risk of meeting them in person. Provenzano was convicted in absentia of a string of murders, including the 1992 killings of two judges, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, for which he was sentenced to life in jail. He was finally captured on April 11, 2006 in a Sicilian farmhouse in Corleone at the age of 73. Angelo, Bernardo's eldest son, defended his new job for the travel company. Speaking to Italin media, he described the matter as a 'personal affair' and asked: 'Do I have the right to a normal life or not?' He told La Repubblica newspaper: 'For me, it's only a matter of an important job opportunity in a sector, tourism, in which I have always thought there's potential.' He added: 'Meeting people from another culture, who are free of prejudice, is a very stimulating adventure for me.' Angelo, who spent the first 16 years of his life living in hiding, said people in Sicily and elsewhere were prejudiced against his family. He has previously described his life as being similar to a 'Big Brother contestant'. 'We have lived, and continue to live, as if we were Big Brother contestants. We have been actors in the biggest reality show on Cosa Nostra. 'I always try to make myself known by my Christian name, and not by my surname. I always introduce myself as Angelo and only if it is necessary do I add the rest.' Discussing his upbringing, he said: 'I was born and brought up in captivity'. In 1992, Angelo, his younger brother Francesco, now 32, and their mother Saveria Benedetta Palazzolo returned to their home town, Corleone, when 'my growing-up began', he said. He acknowledged he had found it 'difficult' to integrate with society and his family were closely watched. 'They monitored every setting, every space - the living room, the car, the bathroom, the windows. Whether they still monitor us, I don't know. We certainly behave as if we were [under surveillance].' According to reports, Angelo gave a talk to about 15 tourists charting his childhood on the run with his father. On a description of the third day of its $2995 (\u00a32017) 15-day Sicily trip, the tour company invites the group to 'gather for an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) with one of the sons of a former Mafia boss.' Salvo Cascino, from Overseas Adventure Travel, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our guests, who are all over 60, want to truly get to know the country they're visiting. 'We also help them to meet fisherman in Portopalo and immigrants that have newly arrived in Sicily. There is also this mafia tour. We help them to understand Italy's South and all its problems.' Another tour guide said: 'If he is not allowed to work, how can Provenzano support himself honestly?'",

Eager explorers have already been testing out the new bridge, which runs through the Wuling Mountain range in the Chongqing Municipality in south west China. The long walkway, which is due to be officially opened later this month, stretches through previously unexplored regions of the vast mountain. A cliff-side walkway which stretches across the previously inaccessible Wuling mountain range in south west China is to be opened . It will allow people access to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is peppered with ravines and gorges with pools and waterfalls, as well as more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars. A tourism chief said: \u00a0'It is actually quite safe and already to use, however we are waiting for the official opening to open it up fully. Some people have been sneaking past the barriers and there isn't any risk, but we really want people to wait until everything is absolutely ready.' The long walkway is about 800 metres long and its highest point is some 500 metres above the ground, according to The People's Daily Online. Wuling Mountain Valley is a 10km long valley, almost entirely covered by forest. The 800 metre long walkway has already been explored by tourists, who have jumped over barriers ahead of the bridge's official opening . It covers an area of around 29.96 square kilometres, mainly consisting of valleys, fields, winding tracks and precipices. Fuling Wuling Tourism Board came up with the idea of a walkway to give people access to the waterfalls, gorges and ravines that were previously inaccessible. It is part of a larger project that created a 'Five Area Zone' in 2010, which includes includes Fuling Wuling Mountain, Wuling Goddess Mountain, Fengdu South Heaven Lake. The long walkway allows people to explore the mountain range's ravines and winding paths as well as get views from 1,500ft up . The mountain allows access to the UNESCO World Heritage site with its waterfalls, pools and more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars . The walkway was created by the Fuling Wuling tourism board as a way to give people easy access to the mountain range and its views . Tourism chiefs said while not officially open yet, the walkway was safe to use but they were trying to wait for the official opening . In the area the Musk Dear Fort Viewing Platform has already been completed. If the new walkway proves a success, other similar bridges could be constructed. Mount Fanjing which is part of the mountain range where the walkway was built is home to the rare Golden monkey and is also regarded as a sacred Buddhist mountain. Qu Lunming, chief executive of the tourism board, said last year that around 590million yuan had been invested in the Wuling Mountain range.",

The 1960s building, which closed in 1993, was once the celebrated South West Detroit Hospital. But now it is partially submerged in brown icy water with doors riddled with bullet holes and graffiti that reads 'Bang, bang,' 'you're next' and 'don't open, dead inside'. A combat veteran used his army skills to gain access to the former South West Detroit Hospital. The building, which was transformed into the United Community Hospital in 1996, has been empty for nearly ten years and is covered in graffiti inside and outside . Despite 'private property' and 'no tresspassing' (sic) being written down the side of the building it is clear that people have continued to enter . One bit of graffiti, written in 2014, even reads: 'Ebola will kill us all.' The eerie set of photographs were taken by photojournalist and former soldier Robert Johnson. The 40-year-old discovered hundreds of medical records, old newspapers and staff time-cards as he explored the building. After taking the photographs he wrote on Twitter: 'It was one surprise after another in Detroit's abandoned United Community Hospital #InsideDetroit.' The bottom levels and lifts of the hospital are filled with brown water, which has frozen solid in some places. While most of the building is empty some of the old equipment has been left to rust . One of the old elevators is covered in more than 30 bullet holes and has the words 'bang bang' written in red spray paint . White wallpaper is seen peeling off the walls of some of the old hospital bays with 'youre next' (sic) scrawled on the patterned curtains . One ominous warning written in red pen reads: 'Ebola will kill us all.' It is dated 2014 - eight years after the building was last occupied . An old brown treatment chair is surrounded by broken glass and debris. The photographs are part of a series called Inside Detroit and were captured by ex-soldier Robert Johnson . He wrote on\u00a0Pixable: 'Driving through Detroit, abandoned commercial buildings of all types rise up from the mass of vacant homes to catch the eye. 'After several days, this modern structure had drawn my attention enough that I stopped to take a closer look.' The South West Detroit Hospital was originally designed to serve more than 200,000 residents. It was sold to businessman Harley Brown for $1.5million in 1996 after declaring bankruptcy five years earlier.\u00a0He re-opened the building in 1997 as the United Community Hospital but a decade later it was empty again. It is not known what the future plans are for the building. Some of the upper levels have escaped being flooded but are filled with broken furniture covered in graffiti. Rubbish and dust cover the floor . A broom and other bits of old wood float in the brown water, which has slowly risen through the bottom levels of the building . Old bits of machinery have been left in their place and are now submerged. The 40-year-old photographer said: 'This modern structure had drawn my attention enough that I stopped to take a closer look' It is not known how Mr Johnson managed to get around the old building. The lifts are frozen in place whereas the stairs are rotting . What looks like a blue mattress can be seen at the far end of one of the wards, semi-submerged in the murky water.

        "article": "Michael Graydon, 29, had been missing for two weeks before his body was found in \u00a0Monaco today . A British boxing promoter has been found dead in Monaco after going missing two weeks ago. Michael Graydon, 29, from Stockwood, Bristol, became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse nightclub on February 21, and was last seen on CCTV at about 1.30am. The father-of-one was in the principality  to watch a boxing match featuring Bristol fighter and friend, Lee Haskins. But he never made it to the event and missed his flight home, prompting a major police search around harbours and marinas nearby. The body was found today 'behind a little church' in the Sainte Devote area of Monaco, close to where he was last seen, a Monaco government spokeswoman confirmed. Genevieve Berti, deputy director of the Monaco Media Bureau, said: 'We can confirm on the death of a British national - Michael Graydon, who had previously been reported missing, in Monaco. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Ms Berti added that footage showed Mr Graydon climbing over the wall of a property and said it is believed that he then fell. She added that the body was unrecognisable due to be in an advanced state of decomposition, but tattoos on the arms were 'really comparable' to the ones described by his family. He was also carrying his driving licence, which confirmed the name of Michael Graydon. Ms Berti said the death is not being treated as suspicious, adding that no one else can be seen in the CCTV images. Following his disappearance a 12-strong group of close family and friends travelled to central Monaco to hand out leaflets and meet police and legal officials. The father-of-one, pictured left with son Reuben, had been in Monaco to watch a boxing match featuring friend Lee Haskins when he disappeared after a night out clubbing . He became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse night club and was last seen on CCTV at 1.36am . The former boxer missed the match he was due to watch and flight home, prompting a huge police search . Stacey Marie Jones, a close friend, described Mr Graydon as 'the kind of man who would do anything for anybody'. Speaking before today's discovery, she said: 'He is such a family man and such a mother's boy that we knew that when he had not been in contact with his mother that something was wrong. 'We are not leaving Monaco and we are not going to stop until we have answers and until he is back home with us - whether that be in body or in spirit. 'He has a two-year-old son, Reuben, who will need answers. We do not believe that anyone can go missing in Monaco and no-one would know what happened to him.' Well-wishers raised \u00a315,000 since Tuesday to help fund the search and hire lawyers in Monaco, while members of the public held a march in Bristol to support his family and friends. A message posted on a social media page, set up to help find Mr Graydon, said today: 'From the family and friends of Michael, thank you for the support and messages over the last weeks. It meant so much.' After his disappearance a group of 12 family and friends flew to Monaco to start searching for him themselves . They set up a social media page and gave out flyers in a bid to find Mr Graydon - described as a family man . His body was found today close to where he was last seen 'behind a little church' near the harbour (above)",

It comes days after the 68-year-old \u2013 who earns \u00a3330,000 a year \u2013 was ridiculed for patronising the working classes by referring to them with the marketing term C2DEs. Viewers said his comments on the Newsnight programme were arrogant and showed he was out of touch. On Saturday, the casually-dressed BBC boss put aside the criticism to dine with a friend at the exclusive San Lorenzo restaurant in Knightsbridge. The Italian-style restaurant was a favourite haunt of the late Princess Diana\u2019s.

At 26, the aggressive pass rusher is in his prime but missed all but one game last season after being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List following a conviction for assaulting his then partner. He remains on the exempt list  until the NFL has finished it own investigation, with reports saying he could miss the first six games of the 2015 season. Nicknamed The Kraken, Greg Hardy is a fearsome pass rusher but is tainted by off-field issues . Hardy leaves Mecklenburg County jail after being released on bond in Charlotte in May last year . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seattle Seahawks were said to be interested in Hardy, but both dropped out of a move. 'At the end of the day, we didn't feel good about it,' Bucs general manager Jason Licht told the Tampa Bay Times. The deal with Dallas is heavily incentive-driven and was first revealed by NFL insider Ian Rapoport. The Carolina Panthers put the franchise tag on Hardy in February 2014, guaranteeing him $13.1. He was arrested and charged on May 13 with assaulting and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend Nicole Holder. Hardy was found guilty on July 15 by a Mecklenburg County judge, but on appeal to a jury trial (a quirk of North Carolina law), charges were dropped when Holder refused to co-operate with the prosecutor. In purely football terms, the Cowboys have strengthened a position of need. Last season, the Cowboys defense mustered 28 sacks last season. During his 2013 season, defensive end Hardy made the Pro Bowl and recorded 15 sacks; in 2012 he had 11 and adds an extra dimension to Rod Marinelli's 4-3 scheme.",

        "article": "It used to be a landmark age when women crossed over from being youthful and desirable to being over-the-hill. But today turning 40, is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone. Here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4-0, and how society's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes. Sarah (top right) with her mother Helen (left), grandmother Mollie (centre) and one-year-old daughter Matilda, pose for a family selfie. The 39-year-old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing, going grey and being more critical of her appearance . Sarah, right, with her mother Helen Ivens and one-year-old daughter Matilda . THE GRANDMOTHER . Mollie Guillaume, 87, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex with her sister, Joan, 84. She says: . 'Back then, once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way, get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance. 'Nowadays of course it seems like anything goes on the wardrobe front until you die - I see some old biddies these days who look ridiculous, showing off their scrawny legs in clothes meant for teenagers and coated in thick, gaudy make-up. 'I've always liked wearing tailored, comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance hasn't changed too much from birthday to birthday. 'I don't like the idea of getting older; I don't feel 87. But I've always eaten carefully, kept active, travelled the world and spent quality time with my family and friends - and I have my health after getting cancer in my 50s - so instead of moaning about it I just feel very, very lucky I'm still here. 'My daughter Helen looks in the mirror and can't believe there's an old woman staring back at her, but I'm used to it so it's not a shock for me any more. 'As my granddaughter hits 40, she should really be thinking \"I'm halfway done now, if I'm lucky, so let's enjoy this life!\" Four generations together: From left to right, Helen Ivens, mum Mollie Guillaume and Sarah with her son William, who's now three . THE MOTHER . Helen Ivens, 65, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex, with her husband Keith, 66. 'I didn't want a big party for my 40th birthday, so my husband took me for a romantic weekend in a Paris, without the children, who were 14, eight and two at the time. 'But I wasn't depressed. In fact I remember feeling happier than I ever had in my life. Turning 40 coincided with a great sense of relief that my life was stable and on an even keel after a difficult first half. 'In fact 40 was a great turning point for me, and it's been good ever since. 'The catchphrase at the time - on cards, badges and banners - was Forty and Over the Hill, so I was quite surprised, as the big day loomed, how not elderly I felt. 'When I was a teen, when someone turned 40 I considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age. But physically I looked and felt okay. 'I had a big Charlie's Angels perm and a penchant for shoulder pads and fuschia, but that was the style of the time. My daughter thinks I look better now. 'In the 1980s, when I turned 40, I was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates. The other fortysomethings waiting there were grandmas. Helen Ivens, now 65, with her daughter Sarah, who is about to turn 40, on holiday in the Cotswolds last year. Helen says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s, it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning,\u00a0'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life' Helen Ivens, centre, aged 40 with her children, from left:  James, William (sitting on her lap) and Sarah . 'But of course this is all different now, and my daughter Sarah is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one-year-old daughter. 'Having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me. In fact, it's a bigger shock to the system than when I turned 40. 'In my head I still feel about 38, so to have a child of 40 is a startling reality check. But I'm excited for her to reach this landmark age. 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life. In fact, in a way, life begins at 40. Helen Ivens holds her new granddaughter, Sarah's second child Matilda . THE DAUGHTER . Sarah Ivens, 39, lives in London with her husband Russell and children William, three, and Matilda, one. 'My dad recently told me that 60 is the new 40, so 40 must be the new 20. I think he was trying to cheer me up but I just thought \"Oh please no, I haven't got the energy to live my 20s again!\" 'But I think that has more to do with having two young children than the amount of candles I'm about to blow out on my birthday cake. 'It's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because I have been surprised at how downhearted it's made me feel. 'I feel a real sense of loss, about things gone by, opportunities not taken. I feel like I get to turn a giant egg timer over once more and then that's it. I'm half way done. 'But as my sensible grandma said to me \"darling, the alternative to turning 40 is much worse so just get on with it.\" Mollie (second from right), with her daughter Helen (far left), sister Joan and granddaughter Sarah (far right) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut, despite the women's liberation movement sweeping across Britain . 'I've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly I'm studying everything in cruel, minute detail. 'In the last year I've gone quite grey and I've started to notice wrinkles and lines that I don't think were there before. They may have been of course, but I just wasn't looking for them. And I just don't feel as bouncy. 'My body definitely takes longer to recover after exercise, and that extra slice of pizza will now puff out the tummy that once stayed resolutely flat. 'Most of my friends have already turned 40 and I've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself. 'I love going to these things because you really see how far people have come. I normally get quite overwhelmed with emotion. 'My mum said she thinks me and all my friends, many of whom she's known for over 20 years, look better now than we ever have. I don't think she's just saying that. 'I think along with added wrinkles, we've added confidence - and certainly we're making better make-up and hairstyle choices.'",

Thomas Davies bought as many as 12 blenders from the Asda store, prompting employees, not convinced he was going to use the appliances for cooking, to phone police. The pair were found with \u00a3300,000 worth of the Class-A drug when officers raided the home belonging to his partner, Gavin Etchell, in\u00a0Tonypandy, South Wales, last September. Jailed: Thomas Davies, left, and Gavin Etchell, right, were sentenced at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court yesterday . The two men were jailed for more than 15 years at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court yesterday after admitting to conspiracy to supply cocaine. Roger Griffiths, prosecuting, said that police searched Etchell's home in Tonypandy on September 19 after being informed by Asda store staff who were suspicious of Davies' purchases. As officers prepared to enter the property, Davies, 29, who was outside in the street, texted Etchell to try to warn him. Inside, police found four compressed blocks of cocaine with a purity of between 9 and 11 per cent and a combined weight of 1,011g and a street value of \u00a3300,000. There was also 5.8kg of benzocaine, a cutting agent used to increase profits, bags and traces of drugs on the kitchen worktop. 'It was the purchase of handheld mixers by Davies in such quantities at the Asda store that the suspicions of the staff were aroused and the police were informed,' said Mr Griffiths. Tipped off: Police were notified after Asda employees became suspicious when the pair bought as many as 12 blenders, some pictured above, from their store. Officers later carried out a raid on Etchell's home . Cash was also found at Etchell's home and a further \u00a34,000 cash was found at Davies' home, also in Tonypandy, when arrested. 'Both defendants were involved in the significant supply of cocaine,' said Mr Griffiths. Etchell admitted further counts of possessing cannabis with intent to supply on the drug being found at his home and possessing a stun gun. He had boasted about having the gun, a court heard, but on testing it was found not to work. Alexander Greenwood, defending Etchell, 33, who has a record for possessing drugs with intent to supply, said he was aware the only sentence was one of custody. Haul:\u00a0Inside Etchell's home, police found four compressed blocks of cocaine with a purity of between 9 and 11 per cent and a combined weight of 1,011g and a street value of \u00a3300,000. Above, some of the cocaine . Andrew Taylor, defending Davies, who has a record for possessing cocaine, said he was a loving father. 'He has reflected at the pain, anguish and torture he has put his children through,' he said. Judge Richard Twomlow jailed Etchell for a total of nine years and Davies for six years and eight months. After the case acting Detective Inspector Dan Michel, said: 'Thanks to information we had from the community we were able to take action and take these two drug dealers out of business. 'They were clearly dealing in large quantities of cocaine and were behind the area's supply. 'A significant amount of cash has been seized and officers will look for any assets that they suspect were funded through drug money and confiscate them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'",

Utility workers dispatched in August found 'dangerous gas line connections' after\u00a0a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas, according to a Con Edison spokesman. The worker smelled gas on August 6 in the basement of the building that exploded at 121 Second Avenue on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Photographs show the three buildings that entirely collapsed following the East Village explosion last week . Firefighters kept blasting water at pockets of flames among the rubble on Friday as it continued to smoulder . Cars were flattened by the debris as the three buildings collapsed overnight following the explosion . When they were at the building in August, the utility workers found 'multiple leaks' in hoses that were connected to the gas line, the New York Times\u00a0reported. The company spokesman said Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about ten days, until it was determined to be safe. The owner of Sushi Park, the restaurant where the explosion occurred, told the \u00a0Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly-renovated apartments upstairs. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone 'inappropriately' tapping into a gas line. An hour before the blast, Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said. A general contractor who went to check out the gas leak report as Sushi Park was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors. Dilber Kukic was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. He is hospitalized and could not be reached for comment. In all 11 buildings were evacuated after the blast, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take up to a week for rubble to be cleared from the explosion site .

Twenty-two people were injured - four critically - and Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Lucon, 26,\u00a0remain unaccounted for after the explosion. On Saturday, rescue crews with cadaver dogs clawed through smoldering rubble in the search for\u00a0Figueroa and Lucon. Authorities said it could take a week of careful digging through twisted debris, bricks and splintered wood before the basement is reached. In all 11 buildings were evacuated, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay. Con-Ed said they may return to their homes as soon as Sunday. The Manhattan district attorney's office and the NYC Department of Investigation are looking into whether gas and plumbing work being done privately in one building led to the explosion.

But now there's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours, without the use of any zips, ties or buttons. The Morf\u00a0shirt is the brainchild of Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces. Scroll down for video . The future of fashion? The Morf top, which was invented by Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, can be worn 24 different ways thanks to a clever double-layered construction . Tamara told MailOnline that her invention was 'almost accidental'. 'I was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend's birthday, and I had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back,' she said. 'But only when I actually held it in my hands, I discovered I could flip it and get a totally black shirt, and then flip it again and get an all-white shirt. I realised then how many different options this structure offered,' she explained. A mesmerizing video on the project's Kickstarter page, which has raised a whopping $35,600 so far, shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double-layer construction. No more outfit repeats: The shirt, which comes in red, blue or green and costs $80 (about \u00a352), is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation . The model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep V-neck with grey panels on the sleeves. Then she pulls it off inside-out and puts it back on, and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves. When she rolls up the sleeves, they miraculously become a bright shade of blue. Later, she turns the top inside-out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back. All in all, the top can be worn up to 24 different ways, providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing. 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara. 'I hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever-changing.' Versatile: 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara . Wear it everywhere: The Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and then transitioning to night . Tamara says the Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and going out on the town at night. 'For the price of a single shirt - you get an entire collection. And did I mention it is a packing and traveling MIRACLE?' she said. The Morf top is currently the most popular fashion project on Kickstarter, with 466 backers. It comes in both male and female sizes in red, blue or green, and will cost $80 (about \u00a352) when it officially launches online on 29 April.",

Pope Francis has said that he will only continue as pontiff for 'another two or three years', adding: 'I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time.' As he completed his second year in the Catholic Church's top job, Francis said that he had 'a vague sensation' he would not reign as pope for long. He told the Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he had the feeling his reign would be brief and perhaps only two or three years, suggesting it was like the psychology of a gambler who convinces himself he'll lose so he won't be disappointed if he wins. He added: 'It is a somewhat vague sensation. But I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time, and nothing more.' The mysterious premonition will inevitably spark concerns about Francis' health. Francis is missing part of one lung after a childhood illness and suffers from sciatica. Last year he said that he believed he had only a few years to live. He said: 'I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then... to the house of the Father.' As he enters the beginning of his third year as pope, Francis sounded weary of the weight that comes with the job. He said that he didn't mind being pope, but that it had been hard work to change his habit of moving around at will. He said: 'The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognised, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza.' Francis also confirmed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, but rejected the idea of an age limit. Pope Francis has his confession heard during a Penitence Mass at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican today . Pope Francis gives confession during the penitential celebration today . His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February 2013. Francis said 'Benedict should not be considered an exception, but an institution.' Also on Friday, Pope Francis marked the second anniversary of his election by declaring a jubilee year that will be interpreted as a powerful signal of his commitment to reforming the Church. The extraordinary holy year, dedicated to the theme of mercy, has been called to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a groundbreaking Vatican council that transformed how the Church related to the modern world, most notably ending the obligation for religious services to be conducted in Latin. The jubilee year will begin on December 8 and run until November 20, 2016. Francis leads a penitential ceremony at the Vatican, where he announced the Roman Catholic Church will mark an extraordinary Holy Year in December .

        "article": "Researchers have mapped dark matter in several colliding galaxy clusters more than a billion light-years away. And one outcome of the research is that dark matter might not actually be composed of particles, as previously thought. Instead, a number of theories ranging from it being a fluid, to not existing at all, have been presented by researchers - who also say it is likely 'weirder than we first thought.' Researchers in Switzerland and the UK mapped dark matter in clusters (shown in blue), and discovered that dark matter might be 'weirder than we thought'. Clockwise from top left, the galaxy clusters are: MACS J0416.1+2403, MACS J0152.5+2852, MACS J0717.5+3745, ZwCl 1358+62, Abell 2744 and\u00a0Abell 370 . The research was carried out by scientists from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, the University of Edinburgh and Durham University. They used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory to measure galaxy clusters - collections of hundreds of galaxies. Surprisingly, the study discovered that dark matter \u2018particles\u2019 may simply pass through each other when galaxy clusters collide. \u2018This work looks at the way dark matter interacts with itself when massive clouds of it are smashed together with other massive clouds,\u2019 lead author Dr David Harvey from EFPL told MailOnline. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. \u2018We find that when this happens, the dark matter does not get affected at all and it carries on unimpeded.\u2019 This implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves, which would have caused dark matter to slow down. Instead, it appears that while dark matter could interact \u2018non-gravitationally\u2019 with visible matter, this is not the case when it interacts with itself. More importantly, the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton-like particles - or perhaps any particles whatsoever. \u2018The implications for dark matter are that it rules out some models of particle dark matter, for example it challenges the idea that dark matter is made of an equivalent 'dark proton' that is exchanging 'dark photons\u2019,\u2019 said Dr Harvey. \u2018To say we can conclude that dark matter is not a particle is too far, but we are challenging many models of dark matter, and it remains to be seen whether dark matter is a particle as many lines of research are yet to prove this.\u2019 Using the Hubble Space Telescope (shown from Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2009), the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be . Harvey's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision (shown), a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. This particular collision is the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter . Dr Richard Massey, one of the authors on the study, told MailOnline that it was most likely a\u00a0different type of particle to what scientists had been looking for so far. \u2018But there are those very weird theories that also might be able to replace this,\u2019 he said. One theory is that perhaps the theory of gravity, first proposed by Einstein, is wrong - and dark matter doesn\u2019t actually exist at all. All of our evidence for dark matter so far comes from its supposed gravitational effect on galaxies - but if our models of gravity are wrong, then this could be false evidence. \u2018Alternatively, dark matter could be some kind of\u00a0fluid, rather than a particle with a property in space,\u2019 Dr Massey said. Another theory is that dark matter is made out of \u2018glue balls\u2019, which are a conglomeration of smaller particles \u2018glued\u2019 together in an ensemble. The researchers created the maps by studying the effects dark matter had on extremely distant galaxies. While dark matter can\u2019t be seen directly, it\u2019s presence can be predicted based on these interactions. \u2018We can\u2019t observe wind, but you know it\u2019s there because leaves are floating around,\u2019 said co-author Dr Richard Massey from Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology. \u2018Dark matter is similar, we can\u2019t see it, but it pulls things around a bit.\u2019 Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be. But the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think. \u2018If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,\u2019 explained Dr Massey. \u2018This makes it very difficult stuff to work with.\u2019 \u2018Dark matter is all around our own galaxy, all around Earth, and is passing through us right now, but it doesn\u2019t have an effect on us.\u2019 He added that it was \u2018embarrassing\u2019 that we knew so little about dark matter, despite seeming to be a \u2018parallel universe\u2019 that was far more important than our own. And from their study, the researchers conclude that dark matter is even \u2018weirder than we first thought.\u2019 The scientists also used data from the\u00a0Chandra X-ray Observatory (illustration shown) to measure dark matter in the distant galaxies. But it is very difficult to find.\u00a0\u2018If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,\u2019 explained co-author Dr Massey . The fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think possible. Shown is the galaxy cluster\u00a0MACS J0416.1+2403 and its dark matter distribution, shown in blue, based on its gravitational interactions . Although it accounts for 90 per cent of all matter in the universe and more than a quarter of its energy, scientists still know very little about dark matter. After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, the multi-billion dollar Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. Scientists are promising nearly twice the energy and far more violent particle crashes this time around - and hope to get a glimpse of dark matter. The team at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or Cern, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May, accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a news conference in Geneva. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' said Cern General Director Rolf Heuer. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' One major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we haven't discovered yet. More exotic theories want dark matter to be a quantum defect from the birth of the universe, extra-dimensional mass, or even a modified form of gravity. What we do know is that dark matter interacts with cosmic structures through gravity, shaping and molding them. For example, dark matter bends light that passes through it, distorting images of distant space objects. In addition, dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters, which are collections of hundreds of galaxies, containing literally astronomical amounts of stars, planets, and gases. Galaxy clusters are also 90 per cent dark matter, which makes them ideal for studying it, especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact. Based on this knowledge, Dr Harvey and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions. These cosmic crashes happen over the course of billions of years when galaxy clusters attract each other because of their gargantuan masses. When this happens, the dark matter in each galaxy cluster interacts with that of the other, offering a unique opportunity to study it. The team's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision, a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. And so far, this particular collision is the best evidence for the existence of dark matter, based on its interaction with the clusters. In the coming years, scientists will be hoping to directly observe dark matter particles in a number of detectors - including the LHC at Cern. What form it will take, though, or whether it is really there, remains to be seen.",

The schoolgirl was murdered by lifeguard Mark Bridger in 2012, who abducted the five-year-old whilst she was out playing on her bike, just minutes from home. Speaking to Closer magazine this week about how she will mark her dead daughter's birthday, Coral, 43, admitted that she will be baking April's favourite chocolate cake. April Jones was murdered by lifeguard Mark Bridger in October 2012. The schoolgirl would have been eight next month . Coral, who still carries April's teddy bear everywhere she goes, says: 'I\u2019ll make a\u00a0chocolate sparkly cake because that was her favourite. We\u2019ll\u00a0take balloons to her graveside\u00a0and release lanterns into the sky\u00a0in our garden in her memory. 'April loved birthdays and\u00a0would get so excited.

'April is a hard month for us. I still can\u2019t go out alone and I can\u2019t eat or sleep properly.' April is pictured here with sister Jazmin, father Paul, mother Coral and brother Harley . April's violent murder united the country in revulsion and shock in 2012. Bridger, it emerged, was obsessed with violent child pornography: he hoarded 400 disgusting images on his computer and watched a horrific rape scene in a film before killing April. Bridger\u2019s depravity and evil were matched by his duplicity: he failed to admit to his crime, lying that he had killed April by running her over in his car. He has also steadfastly refused to say what he did with her body. What remained of April's body was buried in September 2013 in the family's home town of Machynlleth, Wales . As a result Coral, and April's father Paul have been denied the scant solace of burying their little girl. \u2018Mark Bridger is behind bars, but we are trapped in our own prison, too,\u2019 Coral told The Daily Mail in January last year. \u2018We\u2019ll carry our pain for the rest of our lives. We\u2019ll never be free from it. I cry every day.' It emerged that April Jones's killer Mark Bridger made as many as 100,000 indecent searches online . Coral and Paul, who have two other children, Jazmin, 18, and Harley, 12, have since set up April\u2019s Law \u2013 a campaign to stop indecent images of children being allowed on the internet. The full article appears in this week\u2019s Closer magazine real-life special, on sale now . The couple have met with Prime Minister David Cameron and say: 'We want a new law to stop people being able to access online child pornography. We also want longer sentences for paedophiles and think they should be on the sex offender's register for life. 'I am really overprotective towards April\u2019s brother and sister now. Jazmin is 19 and has a boyfriend, but I need to know where she is all the time. 'I miss April every day.

        "article": "The first of our human ancestors emerged in Africa around 2.8 million years ago - 400,000 years earlier than previously thought, a newly discovered fossilised jawbone has revealed. The partially complete lower jaw, which was uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. The fossilised lower jawbone, shown above with teeth still in the bone, was found in Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia . Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primative features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early \u2018proto-human\u2019 shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago\u00a0- LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago\u00a0- Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago\u00a0- Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago\u00a0- Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago\u00a0- Modern humans reach Europe . The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first 'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage\u2019s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named \u2018Lucy\u2019, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It\u2019s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.' The images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place . Anthropologists digging tin the Ledi-Geraru, pictured above, discovered the new jawbone in January 2013 . The jawbone was found in the Ledi-Geraru area, marked with a star on the map above, of Ethiopia . The fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student Chalachew Seyoum from the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Ethiopia in January 2013. It is thought to be the left side of an adult's lower jawbone that has canine, premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw. Mr Seyoum said he was \u2018stunned\u2019 when he saw the fossil. \u2018The moment I found it, I realised that it was important, as this is the time period represented by few fossils in Eastern Africa,\u2019 he told BBC News last night. Dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old. Other fossils of antelope, prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early Homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats. This matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in Africa. These are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the Homo lineage and eventually our own species. Australopithecus, by contrast, was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise. The researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to Australopithecus suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages. Professor Kaye Reed, also from Arizona State University, said: 'We can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the Ledi-Geraru faunal community, but it\u2019s still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of Homo.' The new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history (above) of how the Homo family appeared . Another study published in the journal Nature has also provided convincing evidence that LD 350-1 was a common human ancestor to the Homo family. They used 3D imaging techniques to scan partial skull of Homo habilis - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'. It reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like. Their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis. Scientists used 3D imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of Homo hablis (left) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked. The image on the right shows an early reconstruction of Homo hablis at the\u00a0Westf\u00e4lisches Museum for Archaology in Herne . They found that the ancestor of Homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone LD 350-1. Professor Fred Spoor, a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at University College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: 'By digitally exploring what Homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor, but no such fossils were known. 'Now the Ledi-Geraru jaw has turned up as if \u2018on request\u2019, suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between Australopithecus afarensis and Homo habilis.' This reconstruction of the jaw of Homo habilis by the UCL team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of Homo erectus or Homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of \u00a0Australopithecus afarensis . Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of LD 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species. He said: 'It gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus Homo. 'Finds like Kenyanthropus (a 3.5 million year old ape-like species) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the Australopithecines and us - in short it\u2019s the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush. 'What\u2019s becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle. This new fossil may well be a member of our genus, an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus.'",

The six poignant pictures of the screen siren were taken by close friend George Barris on July 13, 1962, destined for a book about Monroe. Just three weeks later Monroe was found dead - making Barris's pictures of the world's biggest star hugely valuable. Yet New York native Barris was devastated by the loss of his friend, and scrapped plans for the book. He also refused to allow the images, the last professional shots ever to be taken of Monroe, to be published for several years afterwards. The last kiss: This appears to be the final picture taken by a professional photographer of Marilyn Monroe, shot by close friend George Barris on a beach in Santa Monica on July 13, 1962 . Collectibles: This collection of six pictures by Barris are going up for auction next week . Comfortable: The two had become good friends - which shows clearly in the relaxed shots taken by Barris . The set of six original prints have now come up for sale, and experts are predicting they could fetch as much as $6,000 each - around \u00a34,000. The intimate shots appear to show just how comfortable Monroe was with her friend of seven years. Barris had first met Monroe on the set of her film The Seven Year Itch in 1954. 'When I first saw her I thought she was the most beautiful, fantastic person I'd ever met,' Barris told the Los Angeles Daily News\u00a0in 2012, ahead of an exhibition to mark what would have been the film star's 86th birthday. 'She completely knocked me off my feet.' The two remained firm friend. Barris told the Huffington Post: 'What I particularly liked about Marilyn was that she didn't act like a movie star. 'I was most impressed that Marilyn was always polite and friendly to everyone on the set. She was no phony or snob.' Barris revealed to the Daily News that the final shot he ever took of Monroe was on the beach, wrapped in a blanket. 'She puckered up and said, `This is just for you, George,' and blew a kiss to me. That's the last picture I took of her,' he said. A print of that picture among the six on sale, along with a two more from the beach in Santa Monica, while two are taken inside a house in Hollywood. Compilation: Barris had planned to include the pictures in a book about Monroe he was putting together . Grief: But Barris scrapped plans for the book, and refused to publish the pictures for years after her death . Devastated: After her death, Barris moved to Paris, where he lived for the next 20 years . Memories: Barris finally published the book, which he started working on in 1962, in 2012 . Also on sale are six signed shots from the iconic photoshoot of Monroe taken by fellow photographer Bert Stern in late June 1962 for Vogue magazine. Stern's images would become known as 'The Last Sitting' - despite Barris's pictures being taken later on. The black and white Stern shots, which include one of a sultry Monroe naked on a bed, are also expected to make anything between $3,500 and $8,000 each (about \u00a32,300 to \u00a35,200). Both collections are being sold by Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of two private collectors. Iconic: Six pictures for Bert Stern's Last Sitting collection for Vogue are also on sale at auction . Stunning: This particular print - signed by photographer Stern - is expected to fetch $8,000 . Ironic: Stern's pictures became known as The Last Sitting, despite Monroe posing for Barris later . Rachel Peart, director of photographs at Heritage New York, said: 'Bert Stern did a shoot with Marilyn Monroe for Vogue magazine in June 1962 which everyone refers to as 'The Last Sitting' - her last ever studio photos. 'The images he took became very iconic. Marilyn was the biggest star in the world at the time and Stern's photos were very glamorous. 'What is less well known is that another photographer, George Barris, took a series of intimate pictures of Marilyn a few weeks after Bert Stern's shoot - so those are technically the last ever studio shots of her.' Glamorous: This photograph - titled Feeling Good - is expected to make as much as $3,500 . Legendary: The Stern shots form an important part of the Monroe tale and are likely to be highly sought after . Sale: The auction of prints like this one, signed by Stern, takes place between March 10 and March 15 . Pearl added: 'All the pictures we are selling are authentic, genuine prints made by and signed by the photographers, many within five years of the originals being taken. 'Marilyn Monroe transcends generations and appeals to a wide range of collectors. She is timeless and market for Marilyn memorabilia is very strong. 'Because Marilyn was so iconic a lot of people took photos of her, however these photos are among the best and most rare out there.' The online auction will be spread over six days, from March 10 and March 15.",

Kane took just 79 seconds to make his mark on international football by scoring the final goal in England's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley on Friday. The 21-year-old peeled away from his marker and nodded Raheem Sterling's cross in at the far post with just his third touch since coming off the bench. Harry Kane Wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal . The Spurs striker headed in at the far post from a Raheem Sterling cross shortly after coming at Wembley . Kane celebrates as England cruise to a 4-0 victory over lowly Lithunania on Friday night . England debutant's fastest goals: . Bill Nicholson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a019secs . John Cock \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 30 .

After enjoying such a remarkable season with Tottenham, it did not come as a surprise that Kane made such a dramatic entrance to the international arena. The forward has now scored 30 goals so far this term and he was delighted to turn his boyhood dream into reality at Wembley. 'It's a dream come true. Obviously I was very excited to make my debut, and to score as well is what I dreamed of as a little kid,' Kane told Sky Sports News. 'It was a special night, a proud night, and one I won't be forgetting for a while.' Many goal-scoring debutants have seen their England careers quickly fizzle out into nothing. Francis Jeffers and David Nugent found the net on their first appearances and never played for their country again. Kieran Richardson took four minutes to break his international duck against the United States in 2005. He scored again 40 minutes later, but never started another game for the Three Lions. Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson will decide if Kane starts against Italy in their friendly on Tuesday . David Nugent scored a solitary goal against Andorra but was never selected for England again . Kieran Richardson scored twice against the USA in 2005, the last time he pulled on an England shirt . CLICK HERE to read how the Spurs striker fared on his Three Lions bow . Roy Hodgson believes Kane is here to stay, though, and the player himself is desperate to earn more caps. 'This is where I want to be, playing for England and scoring goals,' Kane said. 'It's my first taste of it and I loved it and hopefully I can keep doing well for club and country and see where it takes us.' Danny Welbeck's withdrawal through injury increased Kane's chances of starting against Italy in Turin. And the striker is ready to answer Hodgson's call if needed. 'That's down to the boss, but I'll be ready, raring to go if called upon. I will be looking forward to it,' Kane said. 'The lads have picked up some really good results home and away. We continued that against Lithuania and now we have a tough game coming up, but we are full of confidence.' If Hodgson brought Kane into the starting line-up, he would have to dispense with the 4-3-3 formation that worked so well against Lithuania, unless he started Wayne Rooney as one of the two wide-men alongside Kane. He is more likely to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with Kane and Rooney up front as a strike partnership. Kane's chances of facing Italy were raised after Danny Welbeck was forced to withdraw with injury . The Spurs striker could form a partnership with Wayne Rooney after replacing the captain on Friday . Hodgson was giving little away about team selection for Italy, but he accepts he will face increasing calls for Kane to start after his stunning debut. 'If I listened to clamour every time then a lot of players would be playing from the start in the next game,' said Hodgson, who has also released Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines from his squad. 'People come and go but I think Harry is here to stay. 'It could well happen (that Kane starts). We won't have Sterling and Welbeck so his chances increase all the time.' Hodgson was keen not to burden the youngster with even more pressure although he admits the forward's debut could not have gone any better. 'The word fairytale comes to mind and it's great when fairytales come true in this way,' Hodgson added. 'I'm delighted for him, he's had a good week in training and we've been quite excited to see him. 'But let's keep things in perspective, for him it's been a whirlwind romance for him in terms of playing top-class football and, if anything, I would like to try and relieve the pressure on him rather than heap pressure on him.' Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up as cover for Kieran Gibbs . The 20 players left in the squad were given the rest of Saturday off after a morning warm-down session and team meeting. They will train again on Sunday, when Ryan Bertrand will join in after being called up as back-up for Kieran Gibbs. Seven of the 17 players left in the squad are yet to reach 10 caps, so Hodgson knows stretching England's winning streak to eight matches will be difficult. 'It will be an enormous test for the ones we put in because some of them won't have played in the national team for a long time and they are going to be playing against a top team, but we need a good squad going forward and we need competition for places,' Hodgson said.",

        "article": "All-rounder Chris Jordan has admitted his England team-mates have been left 'gutted' by their early World Cup exit. England have lost four of their five games, and have rarely been competitive, with Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh sending them crashing out at the group stage. 'Everyone is gutted. Gutted for the fans that came over and the fans at home watching,' Jordan said. 'There was probably a bit of anger inside some people (in the dressing room after the game), thinking about every single moment in the game that could have affected it - could they have done something different? That's only natural.' England captain Eoin Morgan (left) talks to coach Peter Moores during Wednesday's nets session . England players huddle around Moores as they come in for fierce criticism for their World Cup performances . So premature has been England's demise that their hopes of qualification have ended even before their final group game against Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday. The match looms as a potential banana skin for a team low on confidence and who know that a long plane journey home will follow where the recriminations have already begun. 'Because of that result you want to get back on the horse quite quickly and try to put in a performance that rectifies what we did the other night,' Jordan said. 'That's the only way to deal with it at the minute. 'Friday is just an opportunity first of all to put that right and just put in a good performance for England.' England will be without all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali after they were ruled out with injuries suffered against Bangladesh. Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with a protective boot on his left foot after first feeling the problem as he hit an unbeaten 42. Moeen suffered his problem while bowling and while he was able to continue on he will not play in Sydney. 'Scans (on Wednesday) revealed Chris Woakes has a left third metatarsal stress reaction and Moeen Ali has a left sided abdominal strain,' an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokeswoman said. Moores throws down a ball during the nets session ahead of England's final game against Afghanistan . Chris Jordan was downbeat as he addressed the media the day after England's defeat by Bangladesh . 'Both players have been ruled out of the match against Afghanistan on Friday and will be reassessed when the team returns to the UK.' England are due to name their squad for the Test tour of the Caribbean on Tuesday and both players could now be in some doubt. That would come as a blow to coach Peter Moores, who will hope to take a full-strength to the West Indies as pressure mounts on his job following the World Cup debacle. ECB managing director Paul Downton has already confirmed a major review will be conducted into England's failings Down Under and he himself has come under some pressure to keep his job, while senior players such as James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ian Bell might have reason to feel uneasy with suggestions England's embarrassment may prompt a clear-out for younger players. Jordan is the type of player who might expect to be immune to such a cull and the 26-year-old admits he intends to use the pain of his first World Cup to make sure England do not repeat the same mistakes when they host the tournament in four years' time. 'We've had a few lows and you can only draw on these experiences in the future to make you stronger and to motivate you to get up every morning, to get your body in order and get your game in order,' he said. 'If I'm still around in four years' time hopefully I'll be somewhere close to the finished article and making sure days like the other day don't happen again.' Jordan dismissed suggestions that major changes now need to be made if England are to catch up with the best sides in the world. 'I don't think so. There's loads of talent not just in that dressing room but in the whole of England,' he said. England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after England's latest reversal . Takin Ahmed of Bangladesh celebrates after taking the wicket of James Taylor . Bangladesh celebrate their victory over England to compound Peter Moores' side's misery . 'We've beaten some good teams in the past and we will beat good teams in the future. I don't think there needs to be wholesale changes. 'I can't put my finger on what exactly went wrong but hopefully in the future it won't happen again and we can put that right.' The Sussex all-rounder was also supportive of Moores, who has already been given backing from Downton to remain in charge ahead of the Test tour of the Caribbean next month. 'Pete has done a brilliant job,' he said. 'He comes in with enthusiasm every day and gets the boys up for training, gets the boys up for games. It's just a bit disappointing that us as players didn't put in the performance we should have done. That's all I can say really.' England will play their first-ever one-day international against Afghanistan, who did not have a national team until 2001. The Asian nation's rapid rise has been one of the feel-good stories of this World Cup and, after securing a maiden win at the tournament in a thrilling contest against Scotland, they will bid to finish their campaign by knocking over England. 'They don't have anything to lose,' Jordan said. 'We have footage on every single player. It's not a game we will be taking lightly at all. We will be preparing thoroughly and looking for weaknesses to attack them.' Bell also missed England's training session on Wednesday, but is expected to be fit to play after falling on a ball while fielding in Adelaide.",

        "article": "The commission that has investigated doping in cycling will not be recommending that Lance Armstrong\u2019s lifetime ban from competitive sport is reduced. The American stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs was hoping the Cycling Independent Reform Commission would be more sympathetic after he twice gave evidence to the three-man panel. But CIRC, who submitted their report to the UCI last Friday and are due to hold a media briefing in Switzerland next week, are not planning to recommend to the United States Anti-Doping Agency that they reduce their ban. Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs . Armstrong waves from the podium after winning the 16th stage of the 2005 Tour de France . Some reports suggested on Sunday that lawyers representing Armstrong placed certain limitations on what CIRC could ask, which in turn was being given as a reason for the stance CIRC have now adopted. But Armstrong\u2019s legal team vehemently deny that, insisting that no restrictions were placed on CIRC in their two interviews with the Texan. Only recently Armstrong suggested to the BBC that he had answered all CIRC\u2019s questions candidly. \u2018At this point in my life I\u2019m not out to protect anybody,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m out to protect seven people and they all have the last name Armstrong.\u2019 Armstrong told the BBC that he is out to protect seven people - 'and they all have the last name Armstrong' The American leads ahead of Bradley Wiggins during Stage 17 of the 2009 Tour de France . Armstrong is sure to be angered by the fact that a number of his contemporaries \u2013 who have also been guilty of doping offences \u2013 did not even cooperate with CIRC and yet remain senior figures in the sport. Brian Cookson, the UCI president, had warned that such a lack of cooperation would be frowned upon and it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his promise of introducing a fit-and-proper-person test for cycling team officials in the wake of the CIRC report. Cookson has said the report will make \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 reading for his sport. \u2018When you open a can of worms you find a lot of worms,\u2019 Cookson said last month at the world track cycling championships in Paris. \u2018I think it\u2019s going to be very interesting - there will be a lot of uncomfortable things there.\u2019 Brian Cookson, the UCI president, has said that the report will make for 'uncomfortable reading' Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he has spoken to the CIRC about the problem of doping . But he also took a swipe at Armstrong, accusing him of having an \u2018agenda\u2019 for revealing he had spoken to CIRC in the first place. Armstrong obviously does have an agenda; he wants his ban reduced when other dopers from his era have not been hit with the same severe sanctions. But criticising anyone for revealing they have spoken to CIRC seems a curious position to adopt when the promise of anonymity might yet protect those who haven\u2019t come forward. Only last week Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he too has spoken to CIRC, having wanted to give a senior rider\u2019s perspective on the problems that continue to undermine the UCI\u2019s efforts to clean up the sport. Particularly at a time when the UCI are pushing for the racing licence of the Astana team \u2013 that boasts current Tour de France champion Vicenzo Nibali \u2013 to be revoked.",

The man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was approached by two border agents after setting off ground sensors when crossing the border on Thursday afternoon, according to US Customs and Border Protection. He displayed 'erratic and threatening' behavior toward the agents and sprayed one of them with an incapacitating spray, the agency said. One of the agents then shot the man in the head and killed him about 300 yards from the border near Sumas, Washington. Scroll down for video . A man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was shot near the US-Canada border (pictured) after 'erratic and threatening' behavior . Border authorities did not release the man's identity, which was later confirmed by a local medical examiner. He is thought to be from British Columbia. Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo said that he was wanted in connection to a murder. Childress was set to stand trial for 2013 assault and mischief charges on Tuesday in Prince George, British Columbia, according to the Abbotsford BC News. He was also set to face charges for theft later this year. It was not clear where the murder he is connected to took place. Lawyer Michael Reed represented Childress previously and said that he was surprised by news of a murder charge,\u00a0The Canadian Press\u00a0reported. Reed expressed 'disbelief' about the incident. 'People cross the international border to bring crime and violence to our communities,' said at a news conference. The agent who was sprayed with the chemical required medical attention but was not seriously hurt, the agency said. The incident occurred at the small border crossing of Sumas, about 100 miles north of Seattle, Washington . Both agents involved in the incident, who have served 10 and 19 years, were placed on administrative leave.\u00a0They were not identified Friday. A multiagency task force, including the sheriff's office, will investigate the shooting, which occurred shortly after 2.30 p.m. on Thursday. Sumas is about 100 miles north of Seattle. Officials released few details at the news conference, saying the investigation was in the early stages. They declined to release other details about the dead man. 'We have not confirmed his citizenship,' Elfo said, though the man was confirmed to have entered the US from Canada. 'It was apparent he was erratic and aggressively approached the agents,' he said. A hatchet was found in the man's backpack, but it was not displayed at the agents. One agent's face was burned by the spray, which Elfo did not identify. Previous media reports wrongly identified the dead man as\u00a0Daniel Paul, 42, who is wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Vancouver. He is still at large. A border agent was sprayed with an unidentified incapacitating substance but did not sustain serious injuries (file photo)",

        "article": "A lawyer for a notorious Dartmouth College fraternity accused of branding new members on their body compared it to a form of self-expression like piercing or tattooing. Alpha Delta - depicted in the 1978 film Animal House - was suspended in October for various incidents including hazing, serving alcohol to minors and hosting unregistered parties. Officials are now extending that punishment over new allegations that members were burned last fall, with one student reportedly having the skin on his buttocks seared. They are also considering closing the 46-year-old club for good depending on the outcome of discussions. A pledge of Alpha Delta (above) reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014 . Attorney George Ostler confirmed a small number of fraternity members voluntarily chose to get body brands, but the practice was never a condition of membership. He says no hazing occurred, no one was injured and members are cooperating fully with the college. News of the branding incident emerged this week via the website Gawker. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a tipster. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker reported. The\u00a0fraternity at the Hanover, New Hampshire, school was famously depicted in the 1978 film Animal House . Dartmouth's sitting president Phil Hanlon (above) - class of 1977 - is a member of the Alpha Delta fraternity . He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. A 1992\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.",

        "article": "A woman who hated her nose for 'as long as she can remember' was finally spurred on to go under the knife after a total stranger told her she'd be more beautiful if her feature was made smaller. Speaking about her nose, Kelly Smith, 26, from Essex, told FEMAIL: 'Everyone has body hang-ups growing up. Like all teenage girls, I had plenty. But while I grew out of some of the others and became generally happy with my overall appearance, my nose just seemed to get worse with age. And given that it\u2019s right in the centre of your face, it\u2019s not something you can hide away.' Kelly felt that her feature was too large for her face and never felt able to wear her hair up because she was convinced that her nose dominated her face. Kelly Smith, 26, always felt insecure about her nose, left, and was spurred into researching rhinoplasty after a drunk stranger on a train told her that her nose was 'huge'. She is thrilled with the results, right, and believes the confidence boost has helped her land her dream job . More than the physical impact, was the emotional she experienced. She said: 'I was unhappy with my appearance, and this showed. I could spend ages doing my hair and make-up, but I couldn\u2019t change my nose, I couldn\u2019t hide it. 'I\u2019d never catch a glimpse of myself and smile, no matter how long I spent trying to make myself look good, because my nose dominated and overshadowed everything.' It wasn't until a complete stranger criticised her nose that she decided to do something about it. Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done. She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure . Kelly says she has achieved what she set out to do and finally feels her facial features are all in proportion . Kelly said that before she made the change, pictured,  no matter how long she spent trying to make herself look good, she couldn't because she felt that her nose dominated and overshadowed everything else . 'I was on a train into London  to meet friends that she when I noticed a drunk man making his way towards me,' she explained. 'I hate situations like that, and tried to shrink into my chair but he was making a beeline for me. The man sat opposite me, and said: \"Wow, you are really beautiful. Except for your nose. It's huge!\" 'I felt like the whole train was watching me as I tried to laugh it off while dying inside from embarrassment. But, finally, someone had said it. I wasn't being paranoid, it was huge. And I needed to hear it.' Kelly said that she finally felt as though she could explore cosmetic surgery with a legitimate reason and it wasn't all in her head. But while she admits the stranger's comment did spur her into looking into getting rhinoplasty, this wasn\u2019t the reason she had the surgery done. For years, Kelly had avoided having photos sideways on and it wasn't until a drunk man on the train pointed it out that she looked into getting something changed . 'To get it done because a drunk stranger commented on it would be silly,' she said. 'Why should I care what he thinks? I had the surgery done for me. For years, my friends had got used to sending photos from nights out and birthdays to me for screening and editing before uploading online. 'For years, I\u2019d avoided having photos sideways on. For years, I\u2019d stood talking to friends, family, strangers wondering if they\u2019d noticed my horrible nose. Finally I decided it was time to bring that to an end. 'Why live like that when cosmetic surgery could put an end to it? I\u2019d watched friends spend money on expensive cars and expensive clothes. I\u2019d always been so careful with money, I\u2019d never really blown money on something selfish. 'I had a good job and money in the bank, and decided it was time I did something that was just for me. The only resolution was cosmetic surgery. And it would be money well spent if it helped improve my confidence and my happiness.' Kelly didn't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend, and while she says he loves her for who she is, he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy. Speaking about her decision to go under the knife, Kelly said: 'For years, I'd avoided having photos sideways on. For years, I'd stood talking to friends, family, strangers wondering if they\u2019d noticed my horrible nose. Finally I decided it was time to bring that to an end' Kelly underwent the procedure at Transform clinic and said she was 'stunned' at the result. She said: 'My nose was smaller, straighter and immeasurably better than it was before. I had been scared that I wouldn\u2019t look like \"me\" any more, but I was wrong. 'While the surgery had altered the look of my whole face, I still looked like me. With my nose now so small and straight, I\u2019d look in the mirror and see my whole face - not just my crooked nose.' Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done.\u00a0She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure. One of the reasons she had the surgery was to increase her confidence for a potential role as a woman in construction. She added: 'I have achieved what I set out to do and I finally feel like my facial features are all in proportion. I\u2019ve changed career, and I can say with certainty that the confidence I have gained from having the procedure has had a positive impact on both my working and private life. 'My boyfriend, friends and family have all noticed not just the physical change, but more importantly the emotional change. I am still me - but with a bigger smile.  I now have the nose I feel I should have been born with.' Kelly didn't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend, and while she says he loves her for who she is, he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy .",

        "article": "A probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country's most prolific child abuse rings. But today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the Rotherham investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from South Yorkshire Police who investigated child sex abuse in Rotherham (file image) The complaints came in the wake of the Jay Report, which described how 1,400 children, mainly girls, were routinely raped, trafficked and groomed in South Yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 . It said in a statement: 'The complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers, both retired and serving, as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown.' The complaints followed on from the Jay Report, which described how at least 1,400 children were raped, trafficked and groomed in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. The IPCC statement said: 'Work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing. 'The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.' The commission said it was also investigating an allegation that South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby Sheffield. This complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service, the IPCC said. The Jay Report, published in August last year, sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in Rotherham, and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long. The Jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist, as the perpetrators were largely gangs of Asian men . Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the report, described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers, mainly girls, were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly Asian men with impunity. Police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist, and of ignoring or doubting the victim's accounts. A wave of high profile resignations followed and the National Crime Agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled. The Jay Report was followed by another report by Louise Casey, which was scathing in its criticism of Rotherham Council and led to the replacement of the local authority's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. After more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring Sheffield, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Alan Billings, last month called for a wide-ranging inspection of his force, along the lines of Ms Casey's review of the council's actions.",

        "article": "(CNN)Team Cookie or Team Boo Boo Kitty? If you're a fan of the hit TV show \"Empire,\" you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series. If you aren't a fan, you may soon be in the minority. The show has become something of an industry phenomenon, with ratings growing every week. According to Variety, two weeks before the season finale, which is set to air on March 18, ratings were up 53% from its January 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45%, from 9.9 million to 14.3 million. Eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard-of these days in broadcast TV, which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services. But Fox's \"Empire\" is doing the damn thing. The show revolves around the character of record label owner Lucious Lyon (played by Terence Howard) and his family, which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what's hers. \"You're so beautiful,\" Empire, and here are some of the reasons why: . Taraji P. Henson . Henson has been in the industry for a minute, and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like \"Hustle & Flow\" and \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" (the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), her career hadn't really taken off. Not so now. Henson has sunk her teeth into the role of Lyon family matriarch Cookie. The character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely, even as she is also motivated by making money. The show's co-creator, Danny Strong, told Entertainment Weekly that fans can thank Henson for the now infamous \"Boo Boo Kitty\" nickname that viewers have come to love. When Cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband Lucious' new lady love, Anika Calhoun (played by Grace Gealey), \"Boo Boo Kitty,\" you want to yell at the screen, \"Get her, Cookie!\" \"So, basically Taraji is a genius,\" Strong said. \"She's a comic genius, but she's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress, and we're utilizing all that in Cookie.\" Watch for Henson to snag nominations next award season. It's old school soapy . Think \"Dynasty\" and \"Dallas\" for the 21st century. It has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious: sex, scores to settle, family tensions, violence and did we mention sex? Set in the world of the music industry, there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy, dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode. That's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that \"and then what?\" itch. It's new-school hip . \"Empire\" has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern. One of the primary story lines has been about homophobia, as Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal (Jussie Smollett) battle over Jamal revealing he's gay. It comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights. Series co-creator Lee Daniels, himself an openly gay man, has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community. \"Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community, and men are on the DL (down low, meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women). They don't come out, because your priest says, your pastor says, mama says, your next-door neighbor says, your homie says, your brother says, your boss says (that homosexuality is wrong),\" The Wrap reported Daniels saying during the Television Critics Association press tour in January. \"And they are killing African-American women. They are killing our women. So I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community.\" The music is off the hook . The show has managed to improve on what \"Glee\" did and succeed at what the now-canceled NBC drama \"Smash\" tried to do: fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry. Smollett has been the breakout star in this area. His mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack's more popular tunes, including the anthem to individuality, \"Good Enough,\" which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service Spotify. Superproducer Timbaland (best known for work with artists including Jay Z and Justin Timberlake) and his protegee Jim Beanz are responsible for the show's sound. Beanz told Rolling Stone the music has to be authentic and original. \"One of the things that Tim told me is, 'If it sounds like something you've heard before, don't do it,' \" he said. Of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on iTunes. Fingers crossed for a possible \"Empire\" tour featuring Smollett and other co-stars including Bryshere Y. Gray, who portrays youngest Lyon son Hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker Yazz the Greatest. The awesome guest appearances . You could have knocked us over with a feather when Courtney Love popped up on the show. Love had a bit role on this first season, as has supermodel Naomi Campbell and '80s actor Judd Nelson. The series has been hyping appearances from music stars like Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige and Patti LaBelle. Given the popularity of the show, there's no telling who will pop up on season 2. Henson and Howard . The love/hate relationship between Cookie and Lucious Lyon is everything. They have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite. Chalk it up to the longtime friendship between Henson and Howard, who also co-starred in the film \"Hustle and Flow.\" Howard told BlackTree TV that he and Henson had to do a \"chemistry read\" to show that they clicked. The end result has been magical. \"We have so much fun,\" Howard said.",

        "article": "She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. But fast-forward seven years and Katie Piper has achieved her wildest dreams - and more. She's penned an autobiography, presents the successful Channel 4 show, Bodyshockers, launched an inspirational charitable organisation and took to the runway in Naomi Campbell's recent fashion week show. And now, Katie, 31, is using her success story to help others by creating the first UK fashion catwalk that will include models with visible differences. Scroll down for video . Katie Piper is launching the UK's first catwalk featuring models with visible differences. The event, taking place at The Ideal Home Show, will call on people from her charity foundation as well as members of the public . Launching at the Ideal Home Show this month, Katie is challenging the conventional catwalk with the launch of 'Confidence - The Secret.' Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.' The shows, which take place on  March 20, 21 and  April 3, have a twist. Those appearing on the catwalk will be bravely admitting what their true insecurities are, which aren\u2019t always the obvious anxiety that people assume. Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives will be emphasising that what others assume to be their insecurity isn\u2019t always the case. In her role as a fashion and beauty ambassador, Katie (pictured at one of her charity events) will launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from her foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity . Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, is keen to reveal hers. 'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.' In another UK first, Katie is also offering two people with visible differences the chance to join her catwalk. 'Anyone who would like to grace the catwalk and reveal their true insecurities simply needs to tweet a picture of their insecurity to me with the hashtag #KatiesSecret,' she said. Last month, Katie rocked the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity' Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life. 'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.' Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success. 'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself \"inhale confidence, exhale doubt\"; it really is so powerful. 'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.' Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008, says that despite what people may think, her height is her insecurity and she would love to be a little taller . Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity. If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too. She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.' Katie, far right, starred as one of Marks & Spencer's leading ladies in 2013 alongside (L-R) Save the Children chief executive Jasmine Whitbread, actress Dame Helen Mirren, Darcy Bussell, Helen Allen, Karen Elson, Tracey Emin and Monica Ali .

        "article": "Those from noteworthy families often feel entitled to abuse young people according to Robert Montagu, the son of the 10th Earl of Sandwich who was abused by his own father as a boy. He made the comments at the Oxford Literary Festival while discussing his book, A Humour Of Love, in which he reveals years of abuse, including a single rape, carried out by father Victor. Mr Montagu said that, during his years at Eton, rape was common, adding that people with 'entitled backgrounds' were given 'more opportunities' to be abusive towards children. Robert Montagu, son of the 10th Earl of Sandwich, suffered years of abuse by his father. Speaking at a Literary festival in Oxford, he said 'noteworthy families' often feel entitled to abuse people . In a report for The Times, he said: 'People from noteworthy families do feel a sense of entitlement. 'It is true that people from an entitled background have more opportunities, maybe circumstances have made it more likely that they will abuse. 'We used to have this ethos that you just kept quiet about things in your life. At school you were taught the stiff upper lip. Thank goodness we got rid of that lip.' Mr Montagu was abused by his father (pictured) from the age of seven to 11, including a single instance of rape . Mr Montagu has talked in the past about how a loving relationship with his father turned to abuse when he was aged seven. It began after his mother,\u00a0Rosemary Peto, goddaughter of Queen Maud of Norway, left the family home, and he believes his father used it as a way to cope with the loss. He wrote about being groomed by his father, as hugs and tickles gave way to kisses, which in turn gave way to serial and serious abuse. In a previous interview, he said: \u2018It was what we did every day. It was accepted that I would always go to his room at half past seven in the morning until quarter to nine. \u2018I felt I was fulfilling a function of my mother who was missing. It was my duty, to some extent, to be in the position I was in and that is the reason I did not resist. 'That feeling was hinted at by my father, by sometimes making comments comparing me to my mother. 'He never said it in outright terms \u2013 we never discussed what he was doing in any terms whatsoever \u2013 but it was implicit that I was helping him emotionally.' At the time of the book's publication, in September last year, he said it would likely sour relations between himself and his elder brother John, the 11th earl, who is also a peer in the House of Lords. Speaking now, he says his family are 'cross and unhappy' with his book, and that he is given dark looks at family events, and hug which are then turned into pushes. However, he has repeatedly stated that he felt the story needed to be told, after he revealed the abuse to his mother and family doctor as a young boy, only for it to be swept under the rug. Mr Montagu has previously told how, every morning, he would be called to his father's room at the family home at Mapperton, in Dorset (pictured), and would stay there from 7.30 until 8.45am . He said that following his confession he expected his father to be taken to jail, but nothing was done, and Mr Montagu was even returned to his care, though the abuse stopped.

        "article": "Children who are are older when they start school may do well academically and socially in the short-term - but are more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes as teenagers. A team of US researchers studied the impact that starting kindergarten has on children born 60 days before, and 60 days after the cut-off start date. And they found these negative outcomes are significantly more likely for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Children who are are older when they start kindergarten (a stock image is shown) are more likely to do well academically and socially in the short-term, but are also more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes when they are teenagers, a new study has claimed . Philip Cook, a professor in Duke University\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy and lead author of the study, said: \u2018This research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime. \u2018It supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms. \u2018Dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison, so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime. \u2018But to establish causation requires an experiment. My analysis takes advantage of nature's experiment associated with birth date.\u2019 Professor Cook and Songman Kang of Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea carried out the research, published in American Economic Journal-Applied Economics. It is said to be the first study to link dropping out of school, and crime. The study compared North Carolina public school students born 60 days before, and 60 days after the school cut-off date. At the time of the study, children in the state had to turn five by October 16 to be eligible to enter kindergarten that year. Old-for-grade students are more likely to be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. A stock image of a young drink driver is shown . Children typically attend kindergarten when they are five or six year's old. Previous studies have established that children born just after the school-entry cut-off date and are \u2018old for grade,\u2019 perform better academically than their younger classmates. This has led to some parents trying to gain an academic advantage for children whose birthdays fall shortly before the cut-off date, by enrolling them later. In addition to performing better academically, Professor Cook's study found old-for-grade students were one-third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school. \u2018Up until the 16th birthday, it is all positive,\u2019 he said. \u2018They are doing better, relative to their classmates, by every measure. 'It makes sense, because they are more mature.\u2019 However, after the age of 16, the picture shifts. The old-for-grade students are more likely to drop out and be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. The explanation for the behavioural change lies in the age at which students may legally withdraw from school, which is 16 in North Carolina. \u2018If they were born before the cut-off date, they have just 19 months between their 16th birthday and graduation to be tempted to drop out,\u2019 he said. \u2018If they were born just after and enter school later, they have 31 months, and for some of them, it is an irresistible temptation.\u2019 \u2018It's human nature,' Professor Cook said. \u2018For a lot of adolescents, high school is a drag.\u2019 Among the old-for-grade students, the likelihood of dropping out and being convicted of a serious crime is almost three-and-half times greater for those born to an unwed mother and just over two-and-a-half times greater for those whose mothers were high school dropouts.",

        "article": "Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit, claims a new book. The shocking discovery made by intelligence officers and code breakers in Israel, Britain and the United States revealed that seemingly innocuous chats are often much more, according to new sections in the book Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad. Code breakers found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay. Communication: Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit . Secretive: Code breakers have found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay . Meanwhile, Israeli intelligence officers who spent time tracking the Internet message board Reddit found more than once, that a terrorist used hexadecimal characters and prime numbers as code. After the messages were decoded, they sometimes indicated an attack was being planned or even about to happen, according to excerpts printed in\u00a0The New York Post. Terrorists are even hiding messages in 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target,' one intelligence source told author Gordon Thomas. In a fight back, MI6 in London and Mossad have recruited linguist specialists in Arabic, Urdu and Pashto to translate the online magazines that both al-Qaeda and ISIS are publishing with instructions. This, they hope will infiltrate a message about a planned attack before it takes place. In the wake of the brutal Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, both ISIS and al-Qaeda have been concealing messages to their followers. Both Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, and MI6 in London confirm that there has been an increase in this type of traffic online, according to the book. Cyber unit: The eleventh director of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, pictured, determined that Israel would use a cyber unit to avoid experiencing an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 . Electronic war: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the country's electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense . Mossad: The front page of the website for Israel's spy agency says it sees the 'invisible' and does the 'impossible' However, when an attack appears imminent in a particular country, Mossad sends details to that nation's intelligence service's cybercommand. By working with each other in unison, intelligence agencies hope to  prevent future attacks. Cyber units worldwide are becoming increasingly important in the fight against terror. A number of the most skilled cryptologists in the Mossad unit for example, have mastered steganography, how to conceal secret information within a digital file. Cryptologists have the ability to explore an area inaccessible to the search engines of Google, Yahoo and Bing called the dark side, or dark web. This no-go zone contains billions of Web pages and is estimated to be 5,000 times larger than any other on the Internet. Much of this information is detailed in a 2015 version of a book by author Gordon Thomas called 'Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad.' It delves into the clandestine world of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad. Mossad is using its new cyberwarfare department to track threats and attack Iran's nuclear capacity. The eleventh director of the spy agency, Tamir Pardo, was determined that Israel would not experience an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. This decision came after it was revealed that an intercepted phone message by the American National Security Agency hinted at the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - but it was caught too late. Pardo understood the importance of cyberwarfare after undergoing training at the NSA. He was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told him that their electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense. Meanwhile, Iain Lobban, the head of Britain's Government Communication Headquarters revealed the country's Ministry of Defense was once targeted over 1,000 times a month. He identified the attacks were mostly coming from the Tenth Bureau, the highly secret department of China's People Liberation Army responsible for science and technology. In the United States, General Keith B. Alexander, the head of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, confirmed that 'our targets are enemy military command centers that we can reach from cyberspace.'",

Michael Chopra (left) poses with Alloa Athletic caretaker manager Paddy Connolly at Ibrox on Tuesday . The 31-year-old joined Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League in August but failed to score for them . Chopra takes to the pitch ahead of his side's Scottish Championship match with Rangers . Chopra was named among the substitutes for Alloa's game with Rangers on Tuesday night . Chopra poses with the shirt after signing with Alloa Athletic until end of the season . The well travelled forward has played for clubs including Blackpool (above), Sunderland and Ipswich . Alloa, who are known as the Wasps, face Rangers on Tuesday night in the Championship and the club are hoping international clearance will be received in time for Chopra to make his debut at Ibrox. The Clackmannanshire club moved for Chopra after their head of recruitment, Lee Ebden, became aware of the striker's availability after he left cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar's football club in India . Caretaker boss Paddy Connolly, filling the dugout after boss Barry Smith quit, was thrilled with the capture and reckons Chopra's experience could be vital for the Wasps in their fight for Championship survival. 'We are delighted to bring someone of Michael's pedigree into the club,' Connolly told the Alloa Advertiser. Chopra celebrates after scoring a goal for Cardiff in the Championship . The 31-year-old started his footballing career as a youngster on Newcastle's books . 'When the chance came up from the chairman, I felt it was a no brainer because of the level he has played at in the game. 'He's played in the Premiership down south for many years and then played abroad so he is a very experienced. I know the player through watching him over the years and he is still only 31 so I am sure he still has plenty to offer.

        "article": "When Rachel Abbott sold her successful media company for \u00a35 million, she set herself two goals: to embark on a new career as a novelist and to find a dream home in Italy. With no previous writing experience, Rachel knew the former would be tricky \u2013 but what she hadn\u2019t counted on was how difficult it would be to crack the latter. Despite viewing countless properties in Tuscany, she and husband John were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th Century monastery in neighbouring Le Marche. Instantly smitten, they swapped their home in the Pennines for one in the Apennines. Dream home: Rachel Abbott and her husband viewed countless properties in Tuscany before discovering the monastery in neighbouring Le Marche . Resurrected: The couple paid just \u00a3150,000 for the monastery in 2000. Pictured: the ruins of the monastery . \u2018When we went to Italy we knew what we wanted \u2013 an ancient building that had been completely modernised,\u2019 says Rachel, 62. \u2018There were lots that fitted the bill but something about them didn\u2019t click \u2013 they weren\u2019t right. \u2018Then, finally, an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew\u2026\u2019 All that remained of the monastery was the chapel \u2013 minus the roof \u2013 and the oratory. Yet the couple were mesmerised by the building and its location. \u2018It had views to the Adriatic in one direction and the mountains in the other,\u2019 says Rachel. \u2018We got such a sense of peace and tranquillity.\u2019 The region also excited them. Whereas Tuscany is teeming with wealthy second-home-owners from Britain, Le Marche is the \u2018real Italy\u2019 \u2013 a place where they could mix with the locals. Back in its glory: After a two-year restoration project, which set the couple back a further \u00a31 million, the monastery was transformed into a modern eight bedroom home . Luxurious: The property also boasts seven en suite bedrooms, a swimming pool and a five-hole golf course. Pictured: the living room . The monastery, near the hilltop town of Treia, cost only \u00a3150,000 back in 2000 but a two-year restoration project on which the couple then embarked set them back a further \u00a31 million. Luckily, the old building had survived until the 1960s, so they were able to find photographs, enabling their architects to recreate the style of original. They covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling, just as would have been done in the 15th Century, and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures. Behind the facade, the couple built a modern eight-bedroom home with seven en suites, a swimming pool and, for John\u2019s benefit, a five-hole golf course in the five acres of grounds. Price \u20ac2.5 million (\u00a31.8 million) Location Near Treia, Le Marche . Bedrooms 8 . Unique features Converted 15th Century monastery, swimming pool, five-hole golf course, five acres . It was only in 2005, when they were fully ensconced in the old monastery, that Rachel turned her attention to her second ambition \u2013 to become a successful writer. She had been toying with an idea for a psychological crime thriller for some time, and by 2010 she had finished her first work, Only The Innocent. Then, however, she was faced with another problem: how to find a publisher. Rachel did not fancy the anguish of rejection, so her solution was to self-publish on Amazon instead. At first her novels sold at the rate of only six a week. \u2018Then I thought, \u201cThis is crazy. I know about marketing, I\u2019m going to make this book sell.\u201d \u2018I set up a Twitter account, which now has 12,500 followers, and emailed every blogger and reviewer I could find. I spent countless hours on forums and Facebook. As a result I changed my life.\u2019 Rachel\u2019s subsequent success has been astounding. A first novel is thought to have done well if it sells 3,000 copies \u2013 Only The Innocent and follow-up books The Back Road and Sleep Tight have together sold a million. All three have been No 1 bestsellers on Amazon\u2019s Kindle store, and Rachel now outsells many well-established authors. Price tag: The couple have now put the property on the market for \u20ac2.5 million (\u00a31.8 million). Pictured: one of the bedrooms . Life in Italy has gone well, too. The couple have made money by letting out the chapel as a venue for upmarket weddings. And with children from previous relationships visiting them, Rachel and John\u2019s house has often been buzzing with guests \u2013 just as she had planned. But now they have put their home on the market for \u20ac2.5 million \u2013 about \u00a31.8 million \u2013 and want to move to the Channel Island of Alderney. \u2018We already rent a flat there,\u2019 says Rachel. \u2018It\u2019s a wonderful place \u2013 friendly and virtually crime-free. As much as we love Italy, we now want to buy a property there.\u2019 Uniqueliving.com, 020 7148 6480. Rachel Abbott\u2019s latest book, Stranger Child, is out now.",

        "article": "(CNN)There have been a few times in my career when I've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace. No, I certainly don't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing \"Kumbaya\" together in the office, but I'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me wasn't, when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be, when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear, anxiety or what have you. I'd love to say more about each of the women I've met along the way who fit those descriptions, but my point is not to single anyone out. My goal is to ask the question, \"Why?\" Obviously, not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior, but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up? I figured this would be a perfect question for Sophia Nelson, author of a new self-help book for women called \"The Woman Code,\" and she didn't disappoint. Unlocking 'The Woman Code': 4 tips to know your value . \"From the time we're little girls, we're taught to compete,\" said Nelson during a recent conversation at CNN. \"I need to be prettier, taller, smarter, my hair needs to be straighter, curlier, whatever it is. I need to get the better looking guy. I need to always be better than because we're taught to come from a place of lack as women.\" The way Nelson, an award-winning author and journalist, radio and television personality and motivational speaker, sees it, we women need to start operating like the boys. Men \"operate from a sense of, there's this whole pie, and I want my piece, and I don't care if he gets his piece, and maybe we even have to work together to start that business, start that company,\" said Nelson. Of course, it's easier for a man not to worry \"if he gets his piece\" since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate America, but that isn't the case for women. Today, just 5% of S&P 500 chief executives are women and only 14% of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women, according to a CNN Money analysis. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with NBA to get men to #LeanIn . Decades ago, the situation was even worse. When I was just starting my television news career in 1990, women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence. Naturally, many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job. \"Because they didn't think there could be ten of them, they only thought there could be one of them,\" said Nelson. \"Fast forward 20 years later. Now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms, a number of women in Congress. I could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us.\" Which means we can lift as we climb, we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers, says Nelson. \"How exactly do we do that?\" I had to ask. Nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other. First, Nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about \"who's in your row.\" \"If you hear another woman say, and I've heard this, 'I don't do women friends, I don't have women friends,' believe her and leave her alone. I mean that, listen to me now,\" said Nelson. There are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women, so don't invest any time, if possible, with people who don't, she says. If you are in a meeting and you have a great idea, don't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself, said Nelson. \"Collaborate, share, collaborate. ... So you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing.\" Competition is healthy and we can compete, but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues' playbook, she said. \"The guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of 'I want the dollars. I want to win the contract. I want to get the business.' We have to get in that same mindset.\" We're all busy but we've got to slow down and mentor, said Nelson. \"We have to build a bench,\" she said. \"Men do this well again. You've seen it in corporate, I've seen it. The guys go out and golf. They do things together and they're building up the next young man leader. Whatever field we're in ... we're less likely to do it because we're busy. We've got to mentor.\" When you lift other women as you climb, said Nelson, you realize it's reciprocal. \"It's not all about you.\" We women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations, I added. \"The right women,\" said Nelson. \"I want to caveat that. And again, I don't mean to be mean or catty but ... I know a lot of women in power positions that don't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do.\" This is a tough one for us, says Nelson. We need to be willing to say to another woman that we didn't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up, not pulling her down. \"Don't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her. You'd be amazed at how silly we can be. We're still in kindergarten some of us,\" said Nelson. \"Gossip is still one of the most rampant, nasty things we do as women to each other. And it hurts. It really damages women.\" Why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace?

Now Google has claimed the latest\u00a0victory, saying its new FaceNet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96% of the time. Google's\u00a0new FaceNet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96% of the time - here, it shows the variety of lighting condition it can overcome . Google researchers call their system the most-accurate technology available for recognizing human faces. In the paper, titled 'FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering', Google claims the system achieved nearly 100-percent accuracy rate on the facial recognition dataset Labeled Faces in the Wild. The dataset uses more than 13,000 face images from the Internet to measure how accurate the algorithms are at verifying whether two images are of the same individual . 'Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches,' the researchers say. 'To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. 'The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. 'On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. 'On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30% on both datasets. FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. Last year, a team of Chinese researchers claimed to have achieved better than 99 percent accuracy. In the June 2014 paper, Facebook researchers said that humans analyzing images in the Labeled Faces dataset are only able to achieve 97.5 percent accuracy. However, Google researchers went beyond simply verifying whether two faces are identical by also attaching a name to a face. Google's system first clusters photos into a collection of similar faces . Taking a classic facial recognition approach, the researchers went as far as organizing the images into groups of faces that look the most similar or the most distinct. When Google's FaceNet and Facebook's 'DeepFace' are eventually integrated into their company's web platforms, it is believed they will automate the process of tagging photos and searching for people and will also make it easier for web companies to analyze their users' social networks and to assess global trends. FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. These were the only images it did NOT get right. Facebook's technology - called DeepFace - was first showcased last March, but the site has now started rolling out the automatic tagging tool to select users. DeepFace uses technology designed by an Israeli startup called face.com. Facebook bought the startup in 2013 and developed the facial recognition tool with support from face.com's Yaniv Taigman at its Artificial Intelligence lab. The researchers used the software to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for an algorithm to begin searching for a match. After creating a model, the team used a neural network that had been trained on a database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4,000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. Its creators said DeepFace finds a match with 97.25 per cent accuracy. Facebook's DeepFace technology uses a 3D model to virtually rotate faces so that are facing the camera.

The tagging option has now started appearing in the privacy settings of accounts globally - although in many cases it says the feature is 'unavailable' - \u00a0but a number of users have reportedly been given the tool. Taylor Hatmaker at The Daily Dot, for example, said that she recently tested the feature using an album of 15 photos. None of the images had been shared previously, and Facebook identified and automatically tagged faces in eight of the photos. Only one tag was incorrect, and the images it didn't offer suggestions for were 'taken in dark rooms' or were blurry. A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site achieved 97.5 per cent accuracy. Security researcher Lee Munson said: 'The social network plans to use the system to identify its users in new photos as they are uploaded.

'If your visage appears in one of the 400 million pictures added to the network each day you'll receive an email from Facebook alerting you.' Tagging photos in this way is restricted in the EU following a report by Ireland's Data Protection Authority (DPA) that advised removing it in 2012. This means it is not available in Europe. Elsewhere, people who do have the feature but want to disable it can go to their Facebook Settings menu and open the Privacy menu. Under 'How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions there will be an option labelled Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded?', change the option to 'No One.' Facebook said it does not have an official comment about the technology or rollout plans.",

The father of  Anni Dewani, the bride murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa,is recovering in hospital after having his right arm torn off while fixing a lift. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. According to The Mirror he was then taken to hospital in Gothenburg, in the country's south, where surgeons spent 13 hours reattaching the limb. Mr Hindocha's family said he has recovered movement in his elbow, and some warmth in his fingers, but it will be 18 months before doctors will know the full extent of the damage. The accident comes after Anni's husband, Shrien Dewani, was dramatically acquitted of ordering her killing when his trial in Cape Town collapsed late last year. Mr Hindocha's brother Ashok, 54, said: 'He\u2019s such a good person, he\u2019s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'He has movement in his elbow, which surgeons say is the most important thing, and his finger tips are getting warmer. 'He may not get 100 per cent movement below the elbow, but they have all sorts of techniques to help with his hand movement.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Scroll down for video . Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr\u00a0Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while driving in a cab with her new husband through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. However he also claimed that Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. Shrien was acquitted of ordering his new wife's killing after his trial in Cape Town collapsed, with the judge saying prosecutors' evidence was contradictory (pictured, Shrien during the trial) After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.",

        "article": "Her choice of thigh-high patent boots, mini skirt and above-the- knee red-and-gold bobble coat was certainly eyecatching. If Theresa May\u2019s intention was to upstage Angelica Rivera, Mexico\u2019s rather beautiful First Lady, then she succeeded \u2014 though unfortunately not for the right reasons. Rather, the Home Secretary looked a disturbing mix of one part dominatrix and one part Fifties housewife, with those gloves that put me in mind of a pair of Marigolds. Home Sexetary!Sporting S&M thigh boots, miniskirt and red and gold bobble coat this week, May goes into fashion meltdown on her way to meet the Queen and the President of Mexico . At 58, what May appears to be suffering from is a classic 50s fashion crisis. Having been there, I know the form this crisis takes. What happens is this. One day you survey yourself in the mirror and decide you\u2019re looking like a middle-aged frump and that if you don\u2019t watch out you\u2019ll soon be morphing, before your time, into a little old lady. Your wardrobe is in a rut. You buy the same boring basics for weekends and the same smart suits or skirts and tops for work, year in year out. So, in an effort to update yourself, you rush out and start buying things that will make you feel fresher, flirtier, more youthful. Unless you have teenage children to put you in your fashion place (and May doesn\u2019t have children), you may find yourself with a whole new wardrobe that just doesn\u2019t chime with your looks, age or, in May\u2019s case, profession. Husbands, being husbands, tend not to notice these things. Girlfriends don\u2019t want to upset or undermine you, so they generally keep schtum. In May\u2019s case, the trajectory was slightly different because it appears that for one brief year in her early 50s she did hit her fashion stride with a wardrobe of flatteringly cut separates in a stylish palette of navy, white, black and taupe. It\u2019s not known whether she feared they made her invisible, however, but what\u2019s certain is that since 2010 her style has been characterised by eccentric and flamboyant outfits. Her look has certainly changed over the years. In the early days after her election to Parliament in 1997, and the years from 2002 when she served in the Shadow Cabinet, her style evolved from ill-fitting suits in drab colours to garish: think of the voluminous orange mac she wore to the Tory conference in 2009. But once the Tories came into power and she was promoted to Home Secretary, she seemed to embark on a brief transformation after losing weight and finding her fashion feet. Shortly after, though, the crisis set in and has been growing worse, culminating in this week\u2019s sartorial disaster. While her fetish for S&M style boots \u2014 she also wore them in 2013 for the South Korean president\u2019s state visit \u2014 is Fifty Shades of Embarrassing, I can empathise. When my marriage broke up in my mid-50s, I bought a pair of similar boots in suede rather than patent or PVC, but after catching my reflection one day in a shop window, I thought: \u2018Who am I trying to kid?\u2019 Admittedly, my 50s fashion panic was partly about attracting men in the wake of my divorce, which is not an issue for the happily married May. But it reflects a loss of fashion confidence at this stage of our lives when the shops are full of temptations that look great on hangers and 25-year-olds, but not necessarily on us. The big difference between May and rest of us, of course, is that her fashion faux pas have to be played out in the full glare of the camera. If you play it safe, as the Duchess of Cambridge does, you get criticised for being bland. Go too trendy and you will be mocked for trying too hard. Perhaps, when it comes to fashion, May should take a leaf out of Sam Cam\u2019s book. The Prime Minister\u2019s wife always looks elegant and low-key, while promoting British fashion to an international audience. Theresa May is an attractive woman and has shapely and slender legs that are amazing for a woman of any age, but if when you think of the Home Secretary the first thing that springs to mind is her footwear and snazzy coats rather than her policies, she\u2019s getting something wrong.

        "article": "As the author of the modern classic A Clockwork Orange and a famously outspoken cultural pundit, he is one of the greatest names of post-war British literature. Yet Anthony Burgess has been refused a commemorative blue plaque by English Heritage because, it claims, his significance and profile are 'not strong enough' for recognition. Now the snub has been criticised by leading figures in the literary world, who insist that the author is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. Leading literary figures described Anthony Burgess (pictured) being snubbed for a blue plaque as 'pathetic' Malcolm McDowell  starred at the lead character Alex (pictured) in Stanley Kubrick's controversial adaptation of A Clockwork Orange . Last night Burgess's biographer Roger Lewis called the decision 'pretty pathetic'. And bestselling author David Lodge, who was a friend of Burgess, said: 'Anthony was a remarkable man. He was a polymath who was extraordinarily gifted in many areas.' Burgess was nominated for a blue plaque \u2013 which are erected on buildings to recognise where famous people lived and worked \u2013 by staff at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester. They wanted it placed on a property in Glebe Street, Chiswick, West London, where the author lived between 1963 and 1968. They were confident of success as Burgess met all the criteria for the scheme \u2013 which is funded by public donations \u2013 including the stipulation that candidates must be well known and must have been dead for at least 20 years. Burgess wrote 33 novels but is best known for his 1962 dystopian work A Clockwork Orange . But on December 2 last year, English Heritage wrote to confirm the author had not been shortlisted, adding: 'The [blue plaques] panel noted his many achievements but\u2026 they felt his overall significance and profile were not yet strong enough to make a case for a blue plaque.' Documents obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws show the panel made its decision at a meeting on October 29. The minutes state: 'The panel agreed that Anthony Burgess was a prolific and energetic writer, but that it was too soon after his death to evaluate the merits of shortlisting.' However, members did agree that his name could be submitted for consideration again in five years rather than the usual ten. Burgess, who died in 1993, wrote 33 novels but is best known for his 1962 dystopian work A Clockwork Orange, which was turned into a controversial film by director Stanley Kubrick, with Malcolm McDowell in the leading role. Professor Andrew Biswell, who is based at the Anthony Burgess Foundation, said he hoped the panel would reconsider in light of activities planned for 2017 to mark the centenary of Burgess's birth. English Heritage confirmed a proposal to commemorate the author had been considered last October. 'The panel agreed that it was too soon after his death to arrive at a definitive assessment of his lasting reputation,' a spokesman added.",

By some estimates, up to half of all urban North Korean . households have an easily concealed 'notel', a small portable . media player used to watch DVDs or content stored on USB sticks . that can be easily smuggled into the country and passed hand to . hand. People are exchanging South Korean soaps, pop music, . Hollywood films and news programmes, all of which are expressly . prohibited by the Pyongyang regime, according to North Korean . defectors, activists and recent visitors to the isolated . country. Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean - a word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found onthe black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48) 'The North Korean government takes their national ideology . extremely seriously, so the spread of all this media that . competes with their propaganda is a big and growing problem for . them,' said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), an . organisation that works with defectors. 'If Pyongyang fails to successfully adapt to these trends, . they could threaten the long-term survival of the regime . itself.' North Koreans have been spending money more openly, a sign . that some forms of entrepreneurship are increasingly tolerated . and that the state is easing some of its harsh controls over the . economy. In recent months, consumption has become more . conspicuous. 'The variety and number of places for locals to spend money . has really increased,' said one regular visitor to Pyongyang, . declining to be identified. 'People seem a lot more confident . flashing the cash than they used to be. I've seen people spend . $500 on a phone with no hesitation, for example.' There is no sign, however, that the regime in . nuclear-capable North Korea is loosening its grip, looking to . make substantial reforms or making any change in its . unpredictable ways of dealing with the outside world. But along with rising incomes, more goods are available in . the impoverished country, mostly on the black market but also in . some state-controlled stores. Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean . word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found on . the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48), and are . also available in some state shops and markets. The device was legalised last year, according to . defector-run news outlets in Seoul - one of many recent measures . taken by the state to accommodate grassroots change. The new rules, however, also require North Koreans to . register their notel, enabling authorities to monitor who is . most likely to be watching banned foreign media.

The notel comes from China, either smuggled or legally . imported. Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled . 18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. He said he . ordered them directly from a factory in Guangzhou that was . likely still in production solely to satisfy the demands of the . North Korean market. The devices have lost their popularity in China over the . years, but still sell well in the provinces bordering North . Korea, according to data on the China-based online shopping . website Taobao. When asked to quote a wholesale price for notel, one Chinese . trader in the border city of Yanji said: 'You want to send them . to North Korea? How many do you want to send? They sell well . there.' Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. The low-voltage notel differs from the portable DVD players . of the late 1990s in that they have USB and SD card ports, and a . built-in TV and radio tuner. They can also be charged with a car . battery - an essential piece of household equipment in . electricity-scarce North Korea. Legally-registered notel must be fixed to official state . television and radio channels, according to the Daily NK, a . Seoul-based news organisation run by defectors. Lee, the defector, said the device's multi-function nature . makes it easier for users to get away with watching illegal . material. 'To avoid getting caught, people load a North Korean DVD . while watching South Korean dramas on a USB stick, which can be . pulled out,' he said. 'They then tell the authorities, who feel . the heat from the notel to check whether or not it has been . recently used, that they were watching North Korean films'. Park at the LiNK organisation added: 'They are small enough . to roll up in a blanket and hide in a wardrobe. They have become . so popular because they are perfect for overcoming the twin . barriers to foreign media consumption: surveillance and power . outages.

        "article": "(CNN)Its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake. Traditionally at this time of year, a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in England's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation, and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances. Do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire, or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes? On Monday, Sunderland's American owner Ellis Short elected to twist and fired the club's Uruguayan manager Gus Poyet, confirmed by a statement on its official website. Less than a year ago Poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at Chelsea and Manchester United in order to stave off the threat of demotion. Now that task is for someone else as Short and Sunderland try to protect the cool $106m it pocketed last season, with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that's worth over $7.8 billion to the Premier League's 20 clubs. \"It's inevitable Sunderland will have been thinking about money,\" Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University, told CNN. \"Particularly television money, because it now accounts for over 50% of most, if not all, Premier League clubs' turnover. \"It'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality, very often it is short term thinking. \"Whilst I'm sure Sunderland are mindful of what's going to happen in 2016, they'll be even more mindful of what's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down.\" The tipping point came Saturday when fellow strugglers Aston Villa fired in four unanswered first-half goals against Sunderland, having scored four away goals in its previous 14 Premier League matches. Some fans streamed out of the Stadium of Light before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront Poyet. It left Sunderland just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire Short to swing the axe, the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind. Even though Cardiff City, which finished bottom of the Premier League last season, still banked $92.1m for its efforts, the disparity between tiers one and two in England is vast. \"Most obviously, the TV revenues from the Premier League deal,\" Chadwick answered when asked what Sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor. \"Also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined. \"I wouldn't want to put a figure on it but you're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions.\" Ironically, Aston Villa were marshaled to victory on Saturday by its new manager Tim Sherwood, installed in the wake of Paul Lambert's sacking in February. Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who is in the process of trying to sell the club, decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 EPL matches. After Saturday's win, the Birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and Short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man. According to Chadwick, research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus, but he argues there are few \"impact managers\" available at present. And he suggests the approach of Short and Lerner proves American owners still don't fully understand the dynamic of English football as well as they perhaps should. \"It's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and I'm not sure American owners are in tune with that,\" he said. \"We've seen it with Aston Villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but I don't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of English football still. \"So they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of English football clubs.\" Chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered Premier League in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end. \"In one sense, it's always been like this,\" he said. \"You go back to the 1980s when Liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they weren't going to be champions. \"I think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams. \"Whilst the Premier League would argue it's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in Spain don't have, even so, such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and the rest dominating. \"For the likes of the north east clubs Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough it is great if they can get there, even better if they can stay there.\"",

Instead of bees hovering around a tree, imagine cheese balls. Solo cups in the place of birds, glow sticks as locusts. What seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in Thomas Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series. Jackson grew up in Rhode Island and worked in publishing in New York for 13 years, ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with Forbes magazine. But somewhere along the way, he picked up a camera. He found photography \"effortlessly fulfilling\" compared to the frequent challenges of writing. So he dove in, lens first. After a charming series featuring a robot, he struck a cadence in creating \"swarms\" with inanimate objects such as Post-it notes and plastic plates. \"I started creating these whimsical, fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us,\" Jackson explained. That's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny. The bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds, made up of something that shouldn't be there. At first, he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions. But as the series evolved, he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves. More than half of Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series is digitally untouched. How Jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical. He only hints at the mechanics. It's just \"wires,\" he said, casually, not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"But if you look close enough, it will reveal all of its secrets.\" He spends about a day building the installations, and he usually shoots his photos at dusk. The photo of the pink Solo cups was shot against mountainous terrain in Wyoming. The cups, already at odds with nature, look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks. Jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement, creating what an Internet commentator calls \"a frat party being sucked into a black hole.\" The idea of a swarm -- be it insects or \"thank you\" bags -- fascinates Jackson. They are disconcerting and familiar at once, creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look. \"Maybe because they fly in the face of how we see the world,\" he said. Thomas Jackson is a photographer based in Brooklyn, New York. You can follow him on Instagram.",

        "article": "A passing motorist who saw an overturned truck engulfed in flames threw rocks to smash its windshield and ultimately free the driver trapped inside. Larry Coulter told WIVB that he was hauling a load of stones on Monday on the Thruway near Buffalo, New York when one of his tires blew, sending his truck into a guardrail and overturning. The guardrail punctured the fuel tank, igniting a fire that quickly spread threw the truck. With the vehicle's cab on its side, the only door available for Coulter to climb through had been overcome by flames and he quickly realized there was no escape. Scroll down for videos . Terrifying: A burning truck can be seen on the side of the Thruway near Buffalo on Monday. Its driver was saved after a passing motorist threw rocks at the windshield, cracking it and letting him escape . 'The tires were bursting all around me,' he said. 'I just kept thinking it was the end.' He tried to kick out the windshield but the thick smoke made the effort impossible, WIVB reported. Suddenly, a car pulled in front of the truck and its driver, Ed Brunner, jumped out. He attempted to smash the window with a metal bar - but the heat was too much. So instead, he grabbed concrete rocks that had fallen from the truck and started throwing them. To Coulter's disbelief, the man managed to crack the windshield enough for him to kick his way out. 'That guy should have been a professional football player or something,' Coulter said. 'It was just unbelievable.' On footage taken by another passing motorist, Ed Brunner's gray car can be seen, left, in front of the burning truck. The trapped driver, Larry Coulter, thought he was going to die before he saw Brunner approach . Brunner then helped the relieved driver escape. He left the scene before fire crews arrived on the scene and Coulter has not seen his 'guardian angel' since. Coulter, a married father-of-two, was taken to the Erie County Medical Center where he was treated for smoke inhalation. 'He saved my life,' Coulter said of Brunner. 'I owe him eternal gratitude.' But Brunner told WIVB that he's no hero. 'I did it because I saw another man who needed my help,' he said. 'God put me there for a reason.'",

Sobia Khan, 38, ordered two pizzas from Pizza Hut for her family, including her 14-year-old daughter Aamana. Aamana tucked into a large vegetable pizza but after a bite she grimaced and said to her mother, 'mum, I think I have got something metal in my food.' Threat: The knife blade which was reportedly discovered in the Pizza Hut vegetarian pizza . Miss Khan, who had ordered the takeaway pizzas to her parents' house in Slough, Berks, pulled out the piece of metal and was stunned to discover it was the snapped-off tip of a knife blade. The mother-of-one, who works at a recruitment agency in Slough, said: 'I thought it was tin foil but when I pulled it out it was the tip of a knife. Everyone was horrified and shocked. 'The thought of my daughter having to swallow that or put that in her mouth is horrific. 'She could have cut her tongue or the inside of her throat. I could have been sat in A&E.' Amana Khan, 14, bit into the vegetarian pizza before complaining to her mother that she thought there was something metal in it . Store: The Pizza Hut takeaway in Slough, Berks, sent a driver round to the family's house and took away the knife blade . Miss Khan immediately called Pizza Hut but felt like she was being accused of making it up. She said: 'I felt like I was being accused of putting the blade in there myself just to get a free pizza. 'I had to explain to him if you looked at your records you will see how many times we order pizza from you.' A delivery driver came round to the house and provided a refund as well as taking the blade away - but Miss Khan is still frustrated with Pizza Hut's response. Mother Sobia Khan, who ordered the pizzas, said she was not looking for compensation but wants Pizza Hut to acknowledge what happened . She said: 'My daughter was not hurt so I am immensely grateful. 'I am not looking for compensation or anything silly like that, I want acknowledgment that this was in their food because it is absolutely disgusting. 'If my daughter or another child had swallowed that, or an adult, can you imagine? It could have cut up the inside of their throat or the lining of their stomach.' A statement from Pizza Hut said: 'Following our investigation, we regret to confirm that the object in Ms Khan's pizza did originate from our Hut. This is not acceptable and does not meet our high standards of food preparation. We are reviewing this with our Hut team to ensure this isolated incident does not happen again. 'We apologise to Ms Khan and her family unreservedly and are extremely thankful that no physical harm was caused. Our customer care team are currently liaising with Ms Khan to resolve this matter.'",

        "article": "History man Steven Fletcher has spoken of his pride as he ended a six-year international scoring drought to become the first Scotland player to net a hat-trick since 1969. The Sunderland striker hit his treble in the 6-1 triumph over Gibraltar, with two Shaun Maloney penalties and a Steven Naismith strike also helping Hampden recover from the shock of Lee Casciaro\u2019s first-half equaliser for the Group D minnows. Not since Colin Stein bagged four against Cyprus in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side. Steven Fletcher celebrates after scoring the second of his three goals against Gibraltar on Sunday . Fletcher (right) curls the ball around the Gibraltar defence to net his third goal of the game at Hampden Park . Regardless of the weak opposition in the Euro 2016 qualifier - albeit the Scots fell victim to the visitors\u2019 first-ever competitive goal to make it 1-1 - Fletcher admitted he was thrilled to have achieved a feat that eluded even the great Kenny Dalglish. \u2018I got asked after the Northern Ireland game if I could get a hat-trick and I laughed it off,\u2019 said Fletcher. \u2018I said I would be happy with one goal as I haven\u2019t scored for a while. So to get the hat-trick was really pleasing. I was delighted. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba dives to his right but is unable to stop the ball hitting the back of the net . Sunderland forward Fletcher is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against minnows Gibraltar . \u2018I\u2019ve been told that it was 46 years since the last Scotland hat-trick and I was shocked. \u2018I thought Kenny would have managed it so I am very happy and proud to be part of history. \u2018It means a lot. It\u2019s really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career. \u2018I\u2019ve got the match ball and I\u2019ll probably put it in a little glass cabinet. I have another one from my Hibs days when I scored a hat-trick against Gretna, so I will put it next to that. That was my last hat-trick so it will go beside that one.\u2019 Fletcher had last scored for Scotland against Iceland in 2009, and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19-month international exile in 2011. The 28-year-old gave thanks to Gordon Strachan for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign, which continues with a crunch trip to Dublin in June. Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club . Scotland boss Gordon Strachan admitted he is upbeat at his side's position in Group D after their win . \u2018It\u2019s been a while since I scored for Scotland and I was aware of that. I get told every day,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s good to get off the mark again, especially after being out for a long time. Was it getting to me? Not really. I was still confident going in to games. \u2018To be honest I haven\u2019t had many chances in games but I had a lot against Gibraltar. I could have scored more than three but I was just happy to get the goals. \u2018Getting the hat-trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer. Hopefully I have done enough to stay in the gaffer\u2019s plans and I\u2019m looking forward to it. \u2018The manager likes my link-up play. I know people have been saying I haven\u2019t scored but I\u2019ve been doing other parts. \u2018He\u2019s praised me for that and if I can keep doing that, and add goals, then I\u2019ll be happy. \u2018He\u2019s been a massive support to me. He\u2019s been great with me since I came back into the Scotland squad and I owe a lot to him.\u2019",

The budget chain continues to undercut the giants on everything from fruit and vegetables to eggs and pasta, an independent study found. Aldi came out cheapest on a basket of 33 commonly bought items at a total of \u00a342.15, a saving of almost \u00a38 compared to the \u00a350.11 charged by Asda. Tesco was next best at \u00a353.97, then Morrisons on \u00a354.29 and Waitrose at \u00a359.98. An new study has found that Aldi, pictured, continues to undercut the big five supermarkets on everything from produce to eggs and pasta . The German retailer was a remarkable \u00a318 \u2013 29.9 per cent \u2013 cheaper than Sainsbury\u2019s, which came in at \u00a360.15 in the survey by The Grocer magazine. The figures suggest that families could comfortably save more than \u00a31,000 a year by switching to a budget supermarket. The mainstream stores insist the figures are not a fair reflection of prices. However it is clear customers believe the discount chains really do make their money go further. Aldi\u2019s sales are up 19.3 per cent on a year ago, giving it a market share of 5 per cent, which is almost on a par with Waitrose. The growth of Aldi and its rival Lidl has triggered the greatest change in shopping habits since the 1950s when the large supermarkets first arrived to push aside independent traders. Studies suggest their combination of low prices and awards for their upmarket ranges of food and drink has successfully attracted the \u2018BMW classes\u2019 to their no-frills outlets. The mainstream stores, which have lost millions of customers, have responded by slashing prices on high profile items such as milk and bread, which is hurting their finances. Tesco has issued a series of profit warnings and Morrisons last week announced trading profits have halved. Even Waitrose has been dragged into the price war and has just reported a 24 per cent fall in annual profits. Such has been the impact of price cuts that it is now cheaper to feed a family than a year ago, and CPI inflation is expected to show Britain is about to enter its first period of deflation since the 1960s. Research by retail analysts Him! has revealed a significant change in the type of people shopping at Aldi and Lidl. The proportion who are in the wealthiest AB demographic category is up from 12 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent today. However, the low prices are part of a package which means service at the budget chains is often below what people have come to expect. The Grocer found Aldi came bottom in terms of store layout, clutter in the aisles and difficulty getting through the \u2018illogical, frantic and cramped check-out\u2019. Sainsbury\u2019s said the figures in the study were skewed by the fact it covers only a small number of the many thousands of items it stocks. It said it was very easy to identify products that are around the same figure as Aldi, such as onions, cornflakes, jam and English butter. A spokesman said: \u2018We don\u2019t think this price comparison is fair. \u2018It\u2019s a very small selection of products that changes every week. It is a randomness that can\u2019t ever really equal fairness. It also doesn\u2019t match up with our internal data or external data sources. 'We have plenty of data like this which demonstrates that we have never been more competitive on price.\u2019",

        "article": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)The Afghan woman is dragged onto a roof and hit with a stick, as a horde of angry, screaming men swarm around her. At one point, video shows her standing with her face covered in blood. She is pushed and falls over, and her beating continues with feet, with rocks, with boards. Then, in the last part of the video, her body is engulfed in flames -- though it's not known whether, by that point, she was already dead. This horrific scene played out in Kabul on Thursday. It's already had ripple effects, including a United Nations statement on Friday condemning what it called \"the brutal killing and burning of a 27-year-old mentally ill woman.\" That corresponds with what the woman's parents told CNN affiliate Tolo News, saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years. It's not known whether her attackers knew this, or that it would have mattered. What motivated the mob, according to witnesses, was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the Quran. CNN hasn't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze. Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs has found no such evidence, either, according to Tolo. Mark Bowden, acting head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission, said that burning the Quran hurts efforts to promote \"understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions.\" \"However, the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act,\" Bowden said, \"that should result in those responsible being prosecuted, to the fullest extent possible, under Afghan law.\" Nahid, a 45-year-old woman who goes only by one name, told CNN what she saw and heard outside the Shah Do Shamshera shrine, which is opposite a mosque by the same name. A group of women were shouting at the eventual victim, accusing her of burning the Quran, according to Nahid. The woman yelled back. This got the attention of men nearby. Police tried to close gates to keep them out but it didn't work, said the witness, noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman. The hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire, said Nahid, who watched from inside the shrine. \"(They) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the Kabul River,\" she said. As of Saturday, 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman's death, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. Seddiqi said that the investigation is ongoing. President Ashraf Ghani ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars. His government is \"committed to protecting and safeguarding all Islamic values,\" including prohibitions on burning the Quran (if that is, indeed, what this woman did). That's a responsibility of the nation's security and legal system, Ghani said, not of individual Afghans. \"No individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners,\" the President said. \"Launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to Sharia and Islamic justice.\" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.",

        "article": "Council boss\u00a0Jo Stephenson, 59, who died after jumping from his roof had been 'stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges' A council boss who died after jumping from his roof had been 'stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges', an inquest heard. Father-of-two Cllr Jo Stephenson, 59, who was Lib Dem deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, died in hospital three weeks later from internal injuries. His wife Hilary told the inquest he had been under considerable pressure in the weeks before his death to push through the later-abandoned policy of fresh on-street parking across Cumbria. It was initially thought Mr Stephenson had accidentally fallen from his roof while carrying out some DIY on his Lake Windermere home in July last year. But Kendal Coroner's Court was told after hitting the ground Mr Stephenson dialled 999 - and admitted to the call handler he had thrown himself off on purpose. He then discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital, the inquest heard. The former Lakes School teacher was said to have been 'deeply distressed' by 'personal attacks' made towards him over the internet. These came as a result of the move to impose a parking tariff in 11 towns including Carlisle, Penrith, Cockermouth and Keswick. The plans were not introduced following a consultation that identified concerns about the inadequacy of the  enforcement regime. This resulted in him appearing 'distracted' in the fortnight before the incident. While in hospital the councillor suffered what was described as a 'psychotic episode' - attacking a pregnant nurse with a butter knife. Mental health consultant Dr Richard Morgan confirmed Mr Stephenson 'lashed out' at the pregnant nurse. He said the councillor also injured his own eye with the arm of his glasses and said he wished the attempt upon his life had been successful. Mr Stephenson's wife argued he was terrified, sleep-deprived and affected by medication at the time. She added she did not believe Mr Stephenson deliberately tried to end his life. He died on 25 July from a pulmonary embolism and bronchial pneumonia, with a stroke as a secondary factor. Giving a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Alan Sharpe stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson had intended to take his own life but said the fall was 'no accident'. He discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured), the inquest heard . The South Cumbria deputy coroner stressed that while Mr Stephenson had told medics he had intended to take his own life, it was not certain he was thinking clearly at the time of his fall. He added: 'It's quite clear Jo Stephenson was very well-loved and liked and had lived a very successful life. 'It's quite clear from the transcript of the 999 call and from the evidence given by the paramedic that it was not an accident when he fell from the roof. 'Whatever his state of mind - he did jump.' His widow Hilary told the hearing despite the attacks he received in the months before his death, she had no regrets about him entering politics. Last year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to respected Mr Stephenson. Mr Clegg said: 'I am very sad to hear of the death of Jo Stephenson, a much-loved and dedicated councillor and a great servant of his community. Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to Mr Stephenson describing him as a 'much-loved and dedicated councillor' 'He is a real loss to the Lib Dem family and will be greatly missed. 'My thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.' Mr Stephenson, who had previously worked as a solicitor and teacher, also ran a B&B near the scenic Lake Windermere, in Cumbria, and was a former leader of South Lakeland District Council. Labour Cllr Stewart Young said: 'We are all enormously shocked by this very sad news. 'I worked very closely with Jo since the 2013 elections and found him to be a very decent and honourable man. He will be thoroughly missed.' Clare Feeney-Johnson, a friend of Mr Stephenson and a fellow Lib Dem cabinet member, was also devastated by his death. She added: 'Jo was an inspiration for many of us and gave up so much of his time and resources in order to try and make Windermere and Cumbria a better place. 'All of our thoughts are with Hilary and his family at this very distressing time.' Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for the South Lakes, said: 'Jo was a wonderful councillor, colleague and friend. 'He got involved in local politics, giving up a career in law because he wanted to make a difference to the community he loved.' County council chief executive Diane Wood said Mr Stephenson would be sorely missed, adding: 'This is a complete bolt from the blue because he appeared to be recovering so well.' James Airey, leader of the authority's opposition Conservative group, described Mr Stephenson as a 'a gentle, quiet and thoroughly decent family man'. Cllr Peter Thornton, Leader of SLDC, said: 'Jo was a much loved ward Councillor, and colleague. 'We will all miss him and the Members and staff of SLDC send our prayers and heartfelt sympathies to Hilary, his wife, and family.' Lawrence Conway, Chief Executive, SLDC said: 'Cllr Stephenson worked tirelessly for his community. 'He is a great loss to them and the Council. We shall all miss him'.

        "article": "The first artifacts from the Confederate Civil War ship CSS Georgia have been recovered. The ship, which was built in 1862 but never fired a shot in the Civil War, has begun yielding items that haven't seen the surface for 150 years before being excavated near Savannah, Georgia . Among the 400 recently recovered bits of history include leg irons worn by prisoners on the ship and cannon firing equipment. Scroll down for video . Divers have recovered 400 artifacts from the CSS Georgia, which is being excavated after sitting in the Savannah River for the last 150 years. Above, leg irons for prisoners were smoothmetal \u00a0before corrosion . Civil War items recovered from the sunken ship including cannon equipment including a iron gun carriage trunnion cap (above), which allowed gunners to aim their weapons . Though the CSS Georgia never fired a shot during the Civil War, leg irons were likely used to keep deserts locked aboard . The CSS Georgia has sat at the bottom of the water along its namesake state's coast since it was deliberately sunk by its crew in 1864 to prevent it from being taken by the approaching United States army of Major General William Sherman. The iron clad ship, estimated to be up to 250 feet long, was too heavy to move under its own weight and was kept stationary at the mouth of the Savannah River with a large supply of cannons. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but an agreement was made to explore its contents before deepening its resting place, according to the Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District. Artifacts from the lost ship will be studied by researchers from Texas A&M University's Conservation Research Laboratory, with hopes that many will eventually be displayed in museums. There is only one photo thought to show the CSS Georgia during its time being used by Confederate troops . Big items such as the ship's cannons will be taken out of the water in the summer, though equipment for the guns is already being recovered by divers . Because of bad visibility near the sediment of the river, divers are forced to use their sense of touch to find artifacts such as a cannon trunnion cap (left) and a serving dish (right) Iron eyes for tackle (above) assisted the CSS Georgia's crew in moving their guns into firing positions aimed along the Savannah River . A group of divers led by principal investigator Stephen James are scouring 40 feet below the water's surface . However, sediment conditions at the bottom of the Savannah make visibility in the water next to nothing, meaning that divers contracted to find the historic items are searching with their hands rather than their eyes. 'You are doing archaeology by braille,' Conservation Research Laboratory project manager Jim Jobling told Daily Mail Online. The divers use a 3D positioning system created by previous sonar studies of the ship wreckage, though the skilled archaeologists may only be able to complete a couple of 10ft by 10ft grids because they can only work during high and low tide. They hope their rewards will help enhance knowledge of the mysterious ship, for which historians have found no building plans. The excavation process began in January, but larger items will be recovered in the summer when Navy salvage teams arrive. Thousands are artifacts from the 1860s are expected to be found, including artillery shells, four cannons, two engines and a propeller, according to\u00a0CNN. Mr Jobling said that all ordnances, including possible ammunition in the cannons, will need to be neutralized by the Marines before being studied. While iron items have survived long years and are in various states of corrosion, wooden bits of the ship have largely deteriorated. Due to limited resources during the Civil War, the builders of the CSS Georgia used railroad irons to armor the ship's sides . Researchers hope that personal items such as this ironstone pottery will help illuminate what life aboard the ship was like for soldiers . Due to limited resources, the ship used railroad iron to armor its slanted sides, called casemates, which were about 12 feet high. Sections of the casemates will be recovered after the current small item phase and the large weapons in the summer. Many items such as the cannons will have excess material removed after they are transported to Texas by placing them in 1,300 gallon electrolytic tanks with sodium hydroxide solution. Conservators are hoping the remaining bits of ship and personal items will help tell about what life aboard the ship was like for crew. Mr Jobling has already been contacted by historians and researchers from around the country. He says that beyond written descriptions of the Civil War, the actual artifacts 'really brings it home' and help students of the period piece together day-to-day life. A  man recently snapped a copy of the only known photo of the ship at a Georgia garage sale, though he did not have the money to take the important artifact home. Conservators are appealing to the public to help find the photo or others like it to add to their knowledge of the vessel. CSS is the abbreviation used for Confederate States Ship, as opposed to USS for United States Ship. It was made after a group called the Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah raised $115,000 during the war for its construction. The process of removing the CSS Georgia's to deepen the Savannah harbor costs about $15million. The CSS Georgia is technically owned by the US Navy, which classifies it as a 'captured enemy vessel,' according to the Army. Though many iron items remain, pieces of wood (pictured) are either entirely or mostly deteriorated from years underwater . The US Army Corps of Engineers has used previous dives to map where they will recover larger items such as cannons and a propeller . As opposed to modern battleships or earlier galleons, gunboats during the Civil War sometimes used a slanted body composed of casemates .",

Mike Day is representing Dallas-based Carrick Brain Centers, where he was treated for PTSD eight years after he survived a gunfight while serving in Iraq. In 2007 Day was hit 27 times by enemy fire after he was the first of his SEAL team to enter a room where four enemy fighters were waiting and quickly shot the rifle out of his hand. Scroll down for video . Former Navy SEAL Mike Day, who was shot 27 times during a gunfight in Iraq, is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans . During the attack 11 shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him. He was shot in both legs as arms, the buttocks and scrotum, as well as his abdomen. His thumb almost had to be amputated . Day managed to kill two enemy fighters with his pistol before he was knocked unconscious by a grenade that exploded less than 10-feet away from him. Eleven shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him, according to WTKR. When Day woke up a minute later in the midst of a firefight, he grabbed his handgun and shot down two enemy fighters before the gunfire ceased. The tough SEAL then got up and walked himself to the medical helicopter. Day described the extent of his numerous injuries on his half-Ironman fundraiser page, writing that he was shot in both legs and arms, as well as the buttocks and scrotum. He said a shot to his abdomen also left him with a colostomy bag for a year, and his left thumb was almost amputated. Day said now his life's mission is to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters' Day's ribs were also fractured and he suffered contusions to his lungs after his body armor was hit so many times, but the bullets missed all his vital organs. 'This was a single gunfight at an ordinary day at the office,' he wrote on the page. After spending 16 days in the hospital, where he lost 55 pounds, Day was discharged and awarded the Purple Heart. Day, who has spent 20 years in the SEALS, has also won the Silver and Bronze Star. But Day said his life's mission is not about him but to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters'. Day has raised $68,585 of his $75,000 goal for the center, which specializes in working with wounded warriors as well as children with severe brain injuries. He will run participate in the half-Ironman, a 70 mile triathlon, in Florida next month. Day shows his body armor, which was hit by 11 bullets.

        "article": "The complexity of the human brain - with its 86 billion neurons - has puzzled scientists ever since the Greek philosopher Plato attempted to understand how it worked. Now researchers are claiming that our brains may in fact be far simpler than had previously been believed - and it took research on sea slugs to reveal it. Neuroscientists based at Manchester University and the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago, have studied the brains of sea slugs as they move. Researchers studied the brains of the sea slug\u00a0Aplysia (pictured above), which have around 18,000 neurons . Their brains, while far smaller than our own, share some of the complex structures of higher organisms while their neurons are large and easy to observe. The researchers found that rather than creating a mass of confusing signals that appear in scans of the human brain, they were able to see neurons acting as groups. The act of remembering may be one of the major reasons why we forget, researchers have said. The groundbreaking research\u00a0was able to identify identify neural fingerprints of specific memories, distinguishing brain activity patterns produced when viewing a picture of a necklace, say, from a picture of Marilyn Monroe. The study proved that intentional recall is beyond a simple reawakening of a memory; and actually leads us to forget other competing experiences that interfere with retrieval. The study from the University of Birmingham and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge is the first to isolate the 'adaptive forgetting' mechanism in the human brain. The brain imaging study found that remembering dynamically alters which aspects of our past remain accessible. They found that these groups were actually laid out like tiles to form a circuit. The scientists say that similar patterns exist in the brains of other organisms, including humans, but are scaled up by millions of times. Dr Mark Humphries, a Medical Research Council fellow at Manchester University who was involved in the research, said: 'What happens in the brain during movement is currently only well understood for small, dedicated neural circuits. 'This research introduces new methods for pulling apart neural circuits to expose their inner building blocks. 'Our methods could be used to help understand how brain networks change in disease states and how drugs act to restore normal brain function.' Sea slugs have just 18,000 neurons in their entire nervous systems yet have been found to be remarkably similar to other organisms. Previous research has shown that they can form memories and signal muscle movements in the same way as higher organisms. Until recently scientists have had to study brain activity by looking at the action of individual neurons using electrodes. Even sophisticated brain scanning technology like functional magnetic resonance fails to provide a clear picture of how the brain is organised beyond its physical structures. The scientists studied neurons in the ganglion area of the brains of sea slugs, shown in the image above . The human brain (shown in the model above) is known to have specific structures that perform different roles but how neurons are organised within those has remained a mystery as studying them as they work is difficult . In the new research, which is published in the journal Neuron, the team of scientists were able to map how the large neurons in the brains of the sea slug Aplysia as they moved. Led by Angela Burno from the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, the researchers were able to do this by using a voltage sensitive dye and detecting the tiny spikes in current that occurred in the slugs' brains as the nerves that drive their muscles fired. They found there were four classes of neural ensembles that behaved in different ways - oscillatory, bursters, pausers and those where there was no strong activity. Until now scientists have had to study electrical signals of individual neurons or the whole brain (like above) These tended to be organised into modules or tiles that had related activity and pass signals between them in a loop. The researchers say the sea slugs could provide a useful analogy for when studying human brains. Professor William Frost, a cell biologist at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago, said: 'This is a really exciting time. 'This collaboration has created an approach that cuts the time taken to map neural networks from years to a few hours.'",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN)Federal agents on Tuesday raided more than three dozen \"maternity hotels\" in Southern California where foreign women give birth, allegedly for the sole purpose of having a U.S.-citizen baby, authorities said. The \"maternity tourism\" sites included apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth, federal officials said. Those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from China, who paid $15,000 to $50,000 for lodging, transportation and food, according to a statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those fees don't necessarily include medical care, authorities said. Authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors; conspiracy, fraud and misuse of visas and permits; tax evasion and false tax returns; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts, court papers said. \"Based on the results of the investigations to date, it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery,\" U.S. authorities said. \"As part of the package, clients were promised they would receive Social Security numbers and U.S. passports for their infants, which the mothers would take with them when they left the U.S.\" Some of the packages included recreational trips to Disneyland, shopping malls and even to a firing range, authorities said. \"Any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning,\" authorities said Tuesday. Investigators weren't expected Tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. In all, authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites, including consensual searches, Kice said. The purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the Internet and through social media, authorities said. One firm in Rancho Cucamonga, California, advertised in Chinese and branded itself as \"You Win USA Vacation Resort.\" Operators of that firm couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Chinese women have been flocking to the United States to give birth, lured because the country grants American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, CNN Money reported last month. That CNN Money account was cited in an affidavit filed Monday in a federal California court by Homeland Security Investigation agent Eric Blair, who asked a judge for a warrant to search Rancho Cucamonga apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime. The judge granted the warrant. Read one affidavit . \"Perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $40,000 to $60,000, which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in China,\" Blair stated in court papers. In 2012, about 10,000 Chinese women gave birth in the United States, more than double the 4,200 in 2008, according to Chinese state media. Blair alleged that the birthing houses \"will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as Hawaii or Las Vegas and to avoid traveling directly to Los Angeles International Airport. This advice is due to heightened security by (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) officials at LAX based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that CPB officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism.\" One operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in California was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $213,968.79 and an annual income of $1,283,812.74, Blair said in court papers. Those bank statements were provided by an Internal Revenue Service special agent, Blair said. Many of the families want an American child because a foreign passport could be the family's ticket out of China if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares. President Xi Jinping's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich Chinese yet another reason to be on edge. \"If things become economically or politically uncertain in one's country of origin, the children have a place to come to,\" Leti Volpp, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN Money last month. The children can \"then sponsor their parents when they turn 21,\" Volpp said. The desire to leave China is especially pronounced among the wealthy. Almost two-thirds of Chinese with more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in the bank have emigrated, or are planning to, according to a Hurun report released last year. One advertisement for a Hacienda Heights location \"claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families,\" Blair said in court documents. \"The apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the American lifestyle during their stay.\" In an interview with CNN Money in February, Felicia He, 27, said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in California. That interview occurred well before Tuesday's federal announcement of raids. \"I started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester,\" He said. \"I asked my friends who have given birth before in the U.S. for a doctor recommendation; then I found a place to stay in the area for a few months, and purchased my plane ticket.\" He, who gave birth last year, said a U.S. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities. Foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in Beijing, where she lives with her husband, and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college. There is one catch, though. Getting a U.S. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for U.S. taxes. CNN's Sophia Yan in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",

Giorgi, who is ranked 10 places above Watson, had won the duo's only previous tour meeting - at Beijing in 2012 - but Watson exacted her revenge despite facing a superb fightback from her opponent. Watson lost five straight games in the second set as 29th seed Giorgi levelled at 5-5, before the British No 1 finally clinched victory in an hour and 45 minutes. 'It was a very tough match as I knew it would be,' Watson said in an on-court interview. 'Camila's a great player; she's just shot up rankings in the last year.

I just had to stay tough and keep fighting.' Watson had scraped her way past Julia Goerges in the last round, and looked set for another tough encounter under the California sun. Both players exchanged two breaks each in the first set - much like Watson's match against Goerges - but things settled down soon after as they made it 4-4, with the Briton then holding serve with relative ease. Giorgi saved a set point at 40-15 on her serve but pulled a forehand wide to hand Watson the opening set. Giorgi was clearly off her serving rhythm - she hit 10 double faults in the first set - as she conceded an early break in the second, and Watson made it seven straight games to race into a 5-0 lead. The Italian, who is yet to win a singles title on the WTA tour, kick-started the recovery with a smooth service game, and had Watson running to all corners as a deciding set looked on the cards at 5-5. However, it was all in vain as Watson held serve to make it 6-5, and then needed just one of her three match points on the Giorgi serve to seal victory with the Italian firing a backhand long.",

Mr Sollecito, who spent four years in prison after previously being found guilty of \u00a0the murder of Surrey-born Meredith, 21, in 2007, is said to be looking at compensation. The 31-year-old was spotted looking at a \u00a3105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome following his aquittal on Friday. 'Healing'? Raffaele Sollecito, who was cleared of murdering Meredith Kercher on Friday, was seen\u00a0looking at a \u00a3105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome . Raffaele Sollecito, pictured in Rome today with a family member, may be seeking compensation for the four years he spent in prison after being convicted of the murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher . The Italian and his American ex-lover Amanda Knox, 27, were both sensationally cleared on Friday, bringing an end to a see-sawing legal process which spanned more than seven years and saw them both serve four years in prison. Speaking later at a press conference in Rome, Mr Sollecito described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare'. He spent four years in prison before being freed in 2011, said he wanted to get back to his old life after enduring over seven years of 'a kind of pain without an end'. Until Friday's ruling, life was a 'kind of limbo,' Sollecito said. 'So for me, the wounds inside my soul, inside my heart ... it's very hard to erase them.' He said he needed 'time to heal,' and 'time to really breathe this fresh air.' Planning ahead: Sollecito's lawyer says her client will wait for Italy's top court to give the reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months' time, before taking a decision on compensation . Raffaele Sollecito (right) flanked by his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno, talks to the media during a press conference in Rome. He described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare' Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after Friday's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011 . 'I feel today like someone who was kidnapped, who after seven years and five months has returned to freedom,' Sollecito said. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said on Monday her . client, would wait for Italy's top court to give the . reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months' time, before taking a decision. 'We have already heard people talking about compensation ... if we want to make someone pay,' Bongiorno said at a news . conference. 'We will see if any mistakes were made, what . measures to take, but this is all far in the future.' Yesterday, Knox's lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to\u00a0The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito's father\u00a0Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the ruling on Friday night as 'odd'. She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Miss Knox told reporters outside her family home in Seattle on the day of the verdict that she was 'full of joy'. 'Right now I'm still absorbing what all this means and what comes to mind is my gratitude for the life that's been given to me,' she said. Seattle-born Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011. But Italy's highest court on Friday overturned last year's convictions and declined to order another trial. The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. After they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence. Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood. The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.",

        "article": "The Tories are planning to repeat the 'Labour tax bombshell' campaign that won them the 1992 general election. David Cameron will argue Labour has \u00a315billion of unexplained tax cuts, having voted to back Government plans to save \u00a330billion over five years. Yesterday, the Prime Minister torpedoed Labour's central economic attack by categorically ruling out a rise in VAT. Asked by Ed Miliband at the final Prime Minister's Questions before polling day whether he would rule out a rise in VAT, he replied: 'The answer is yes.' The announcement left Mr Miliband, who appeared unprepared for the 'straight answer' he had demanded, floundering. Scroll down for video . Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . Labour had planned to make the possibility of a Tory VAT rise a key part of the election campaign. It has already drawn up billboards featuring a swinging block of concrete in the shape of the letters VAT. Mr Cameron then challenged Mr Miliband to rule out the prospect of Labour raising national insurance contributions, which it did in 2002. The Labour leader repeatedly declined to do so, saying the Tories would have 'plenty of time to ask questions' after polling day on May 7. However, within two hours of PMQs finishing, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls issued a different message. 'We will make it clear in the manifesto Labour will not be raising national insurance. That will be a clear pledge from us,' Mr Balls said. Later he ruled out any increase in either the basic or higher rate of income tax. 'We have clear pledges. No rise in VAT under Labour, no rise in the basic and higher rates of income tax under Labour, no rise in national insurance under Labour,' Mr Balls said. 'Our plans add up, theirs don't. As night follows day, if people vote Tory VAT will go up. It always does and it will again.' Conservative sources suggested the party had set a trap for Mr Miliband because Chancellor George Osborne had repeatedly refused to rule out a rise in VAT under questioning from Labour MPs. 'Labour has been panicked today into ruling out tax rises left, right and centre,' said a senior official. 'So where is the \u00a315billion tax bombshell going to fall? It is a safe bet that this is going to feature heavily in our campaign.' Conservative sources said the party had set a trap for Mr Miliband because Chancellor George Osborne two days ago (pictured) declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT . In an echo of slogans in the 1992 election campaign, when John Major defied the polls to win a majority, Mr Cameron said: 'We know there is a tax bombshell coming from Labour \u2026 It would wreck our economy.' The issue is likely to figure in the first leaders' TV interviews of the election campaign tonight, when Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband face a grilling from Jeremy Paxman and Kay Burley on Channel 4 and Sky News. The Tories have claimed they do not intend to raise any taxes, instead saving \u00a313billion from the budgets of Government departments, \u00a312billion from cutting the benefits bill and \u00a35billion from measures to squeeze tax avoidance. However, they have to find \u00a37billion to fund two tax pledges by the end of the next parliament \u2013 an increase in the personal allowance for income tax to \u00a312,500 and the threshold for the 40p rate rising to \u00a350,000. The announcements from the Conservatives and Labour severely restrict the room for manoeuvre of both on taxation after the next election because VAT and national insurance raise huge amounts for the Treasury. Raising significant sums elsewhere might require new taxes on businesses. Mr Miliband insisted 'nobody would believe' Mr Cameron's pledge and Labour officials said the party would press ahead with its billboard campaign. They pointed out that Mr Cameron had said before the last election that he had 'no plans' to raise VAT. Mr Osborne raised VAT from 17.5 to 20 per cent in his emergency budget in June 2010. Labour said the Tories had made a similar pledge before the 1992 election, only to break it a year later. Last night, Mr Cameron was cheered as he addressed the last meeting of the backbench 1922 committee of this parliament. 'We've got the song, we've got the tune, we've got the lines, we've got the policies,' the Prime Minister said. 'So let's get out there and sing about it. Let's get out there and win.'",

Camilla, wearing an opulent pearl necklace, and the Prince of Wales were guests of honor at the International Conservation Caucus Foundation Gala at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium. Earlier in the day Prince Charles had tried a piece of cake at an adult education project in Washington DC. 'A bit of orange in it. Makes a whole difference,' he said. Scroll down for video . Proving he can't resist anything except temptation, Prince Charles tries a piece of cake at an adult education project . Camilla wore an opulent pearl necklace and listened intently as Charles gave his own pearls of wisdom from the stage at the\u00a0International Conservation Caucus Foundation Gala . Prince Charles was presented with the ICCF's Teddy Roosevelt International Conservation Award at the gala dinner at the\u00a0Andrew Mellon Auditorium . After being presented with the award Prince Charles gave a speech at the event which is billed as one of the most important gatherings of the conservation community . Camilla listened attentively as Charles addressed guests on their last night in the U.S. At the gala dinner Prince Charles was awarded the ICCF Teddy Roosevelt Award for Exceptional\u00a0Leadership in Conservation before offering his own pearls of wisdom from the stage. The gala is billed as the most important annual conservation gathering of U.S. members of Congress, foreign heads of state, ambassadors, corporate executives, conservation legends, celebrities, and NGO and civil society leaders to celebrate conservation successes. Addressing the gala dinner, Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment, citing President Franklin Roosevelt who sought to protect the nation's wildlife and open spaces. He said: 'The world has looked to the United States for leadership in so many challenging circumstances in the past. 'However, today we are faced by truly exceptional challenges and threats - a veritable \"perfect storm\" which, if not met by strong, decisive and far-sighted leadership, could overwhelm our capacity to rectify the damage and thereby destroy our grandchildren's future inheritance.' He listed his areas of concern from the continuing destruction of rainforests, to the threat to endangered animals like rhinos, elephants and tigers and the need for sustainable cities. Prince Charkes gives a speech at an Exceptional Leadership in Conservation Reception at Andrew Mellon Hall  in Washington, DC, on the third day of a visit to the United States . The  Prince of Wales spoke after being presented with the International Conservation Caucus Foundation Teddy Roosevelt Award for Exceptional Leadership in Conservation . The Prince is presented with an award for his work as an environment leader for more than 40 years . Prince Charles accepts the award for his 'extraordinary' conservation leadership on a four-day visit to the US . The prince told the invited guests: 'I repeatedly hear it said - as I am sure you do - that looking after nature is too costly; a barrier to growth and a danger to economic competitiveness. 'So long as this perspective prevails, then I fear the destruction of natural systems will be seen as in some way rational and an unavoidable price of progress.' Today Charles and Camilla will proceed to Louisville, Kentucky, for the final stop on their trip. They will attend a cultural festival hosted by the Governor of Kentucky and Mayor of Louisville at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage Center. Camilla will visit Neighborhood House, a community center serving Portland, one of Louisville\u2019s oldest and most diverse, but also most impoverished communities. Prince Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment . Prince Charles is seen making his way to a meeting with with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, at the US Capitol in Washington, D.C. yesterday . She will also attend a reception for patrons and supporters of The Brooke USA at Churchill Downs. The Brooke is an international animal welfare organisation dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys and mules in some of the world's poorest communities. They will then return to the U.K. in the evening. Earlier yesterday President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House. A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to\u00a0Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance. The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas. President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House . The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present . Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them. Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun. He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last. Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans. His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents.

        "article": "This winter has been the season that literally divided America into two. This stunning weather map shows\u00a0how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest February's on record, while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average . The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and\u00a0Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover. Ice-encrusted: Lower Manhattan as seen from  the Staten Island Ferry on February 25, 2015 as the New York Harbor is filled with large chunks of ice as the East River and Hudson freeze over . The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California'sthree-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years . Researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the US last. NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a\u00a0persistent ridge\u00a0of high pressure\u2014nicknamed\u00a0the \u201cRidiculously Resilient Ridge\u201d\u2014over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'",

        "article": "The All England Lawn Tennis Club has apologised for using the iconic Tennis Girl poster from the 1970s to promote an upcoming exhibition but will still feature the work. The poster featuring blonde model Fiona Butler, who was 18 at the time the image was taken, attracted a flurry of criticism when the official Wimbledon Twitter account included it in a post promoting the Powerful Posters exhibition. Some followers accused the home of Wimbledon of sexism for highlighting the image, taken by\u00a0the late Martin Elliott in 1976 at the University of Birmingham's tennis courts and printed by Athena. 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it,' the profile later said after removing the post. Athena's Tennis Girl poster caused a Twitter stir and Wimbledon was forced to apologise after using it to promote a forthcoming exhibition called Powerful Posters . Last year the dress worn by Butler in the famous image, the wooden tennis racquet she is holding, a a 1979 edition poster and a 1980s limited edition canvas print were sold at auction for \u00a315,500. While such a price may indicate its historic value and iconic status, many on Twitter felt it had no place as a promotional tool for the exhibit in which it features at the respected venue. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma expressed her outrage on Twitter, saying: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who go by the name 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster, which will be exhibited with the handmade dress worn by model Fiona Butler and wooden racquet used in the 1976 shoot, to promote the exhibition . Even the wording of the apology attracted criticism as a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Twitter user David B backed the club, saying: 'Presumably John McEnroe will now have to be airbrushed out of Wimbledon history? These PC idiots - \"They cannot be serious!\"' An All England Club spokesman has since confirmed the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over two million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter . Roger Federer's fan group said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for \u2013 I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19.",

        "article": "A homeowner checking his house after tenants moved out found the property had been rigged with explosives set to detonate with the flip of a light switch. Lendel Williams was inspecting the house in Milton, Massachusetts on Tuesday as he prepared to sell the home when his electrician came across the suspicious device in a bedroom closet. They called police and it was successfully deactivated a few hours later. 'I am angry,' Lendel told reporters outside the home on Tuesday night. 'I just can't believe people can really do that to be quite frank with you.' Scroll down for video . Danger: This owner of this home in Milton, Massachusetts found it had been rigged with explosives . Safe: The homeowner called police who arrived at the home on Tuesday and deactivated the device . Investigation: Hours later they declared the home safe and removed items from the property . The electrician found the explosive device behind a recently plastered section of wall in a bedroom closet, CBS Boston reported. The mechanism involved a gallon of a flammable substance with wires snaking out of it and around the house. The end of the wire led to a light switch. 'We believe the intention was that if someone flipped the light switch on where it ended, the device would have exploded,' Milton Police Chief Richard Wells said. 'It took some work to put it in there.' Authorities said the intricate system could have caused 'significant destruction' if it had been set off and could have even resulted in a loss of life. Police have not yet named any suspects and said they are considering anyone with access to the house as a person of interest in the case, WCVB reported. Shock: Homeowner Lendel Williams, pictured, said he could not believe that someone had set up the device, which his electrician found behind a recently-plastered wall during an inspection on Tuesday . Scene: Police and members of the bomb squad swarm the street outside the home on Tuesday . But Williams said he believes his former tenants could be responsible and the Boston and Milton police departments are looking for them. Last week, police were called to the home for an act of vandalism after Williams found cement had been poured down the drain. On Sunday, a few days after the complaint was filed, the former tenants, a man, his wife and their daughter, moved out. They had lived at the property since June. Police were called to the home on Craig Street and several hours later, a bomb squad rendered the device safe. Officers were seen removing brown bags from the house. See below for video .",

The child, whose name has not been released, was visiting with his family from New Mexico and was inside the hang glider tethered to a pick-up truck that plummeted to the ground on Friday afternoon. The adult male instructor, who has not been identified, died at the scene, while the boy's family  was able to transport him to Nevada Highway Patrol troopers who were on the side of the road. However, as troopers performed CPR they were unable to revive him. Scroll down for video . A boy, 12, and his hang-gliding instructor died after their glider crashed onto a dry lake bed in Nevada . During the activity, the hang gliding company, which has not been named, tethers gliders to the rear of a pickup truck to propel them into the air . Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grandfather said that the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding . Metro police and NHP troopers arrived at the first scene of the incident, where the glider crashed at the Jean dry lake bed, near Sloan Road and Interstate 15 at 2.50pm, according to the\u00a0Las Vegas Review Journal. The family. from Farmington, was a part of a tour group that was organized to do the activity with the hang gliding company, which has not been named,\u00a0according to\u00a0Fox 5 Vegas. Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grand-father, said the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding. The boy was the most excited of the group so he was selected to go on the first ride. During the activity, the hang gliding company tethers gliders to the rear of a truck to propel them into the air. Police said the hang glider was in the air when the truck driver pulling them turned around abruptly. The driver is believed to have thought the tether had been released which is ordinarily done by the person inside of the glider, before both the child and the man tragically plummeted to the ground. Authorities are still trying to piece together the cause of the incident and said it was too early to determine if it was a result of a mechanical or operational issue, said\u00a0Capt. Peter Boffelli . Police said the glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur . Troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson . Metro police and the Federal Aviation Administration are still investigating the incident . 'The glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur,' said Capt. Peter Boffelli from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. 'So what occurred is when the truck turned around thinking the tether was released, the glider itself plummeted straight to the ground.' The male instructor died while inside the glider. The boy's family and some of the company's employees placed the child inside of a truck and were headed to a hospital in Las Vegas when they spotted NHP troopers 10 miles away on the side of the road, according to\u00a08 News Now. The troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson. Authorities are still trying to piece together the cause of the incident and said it was too early to determine if it was a result of a mechanical or operational issue, said Boffelli.

        "article": "It's a pivotal policy for the Federal Government but questions are being asked of the Prime Minister's understanding, or lack thereof, around metadata after his bizarre claim that he never worried about police looking into his, when he was a journalist. The problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when Tony Abbott was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s, before the advent of the Internet. 'In the days when I was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists,' he stated to a gathering of reporters on Wednesday. But if you do the math, his argument simply does not stack up. I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said. His writing career ended before the internet began . While metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation; including phone numbers and length and time of calls, the overhaul's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions, particularly the online and email world. The Internet came to be, effectively, in 1992. Full text searches were not available for two years after that and email access came to being about the same time. By then, Tony Abbott was well and truly ensconced as press secretary to Opposition Leader Dr John Hewson, his days as a writer for The Bulletin and The Australian all but over. 'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said. 'A contested warrant is more like a court case and if you had to have a court case to access metadata, well, the whole process would absolutely gum up,' he said. In trying to explain the planned two-year retention, Mr Abbott has previously stated that he believed metadata to be the 'sites you're visiting'. 'It's not what you are doing on the internet, it's the site's you are visiting, it's not the content it's just where you have been. 'It's the person you are sending it to, the person sending it, it's the date and the place it's posted from.' Federal Labor had earlier agreed to support new metadata laws with amendments. The government bill, which is expected to pass parliament by the end of next week, forces telecommunications companies to keep two years of customer data, such as the time and length of a phone call.\u00a0The laws would allow for warrant-less access by government agencies. The government has agreed to a number of Labor amendments, including better protections for journalists. Australian Press Council chairman David Weisbrot, has expressed his concern the laws could crush investigative journalism and dissuade whistle-blowers from coming forward. 'A healthy democratic society requires robust free speech and a free and vigorous press to hold governments and other powerful interests to account,' he said. 'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister told the Canberra media gallery . Metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications. The worry for journalists is that sources might be hesitant to come forward knowing that metadata could lead investigators to their door. 'These are not hypothetical concerns,' Professor Weisbrot said. He said governments were increasingly chasing down leaks and stripping away whistle-blower protections. 'These legitimate concerns cannot be addressed effectively short of exempting journalists and media organisations.' Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed . A parliamentary committee recommended in February the laws be passed, but called for safeguards for journalists. It recommended the issue of protecting journalists' sources be referred to a separate inquiry to report to parliament within three months. Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed. The government wants the regime legislated this month.",

        "article": "It\u2019s a privilege reserved for a lucky few but now experts have revealed exactly who is getting on board when it comes to private jets. The spotlight has been shone on the industry's latest marketing statistics - identifying Americans as the most frequent flyers while\u00a0the busiest route is between Moscow and Nice. Billionaire entrepreneurs, chief executives and A-list celebrities are amongst the exclusive clientele, found to be 80 per cent men. Top ten: Aviation experts NetJets, which has the largest private jet fleet in the world, has listed its top ten routes with passengers . High flyers: A NetJets Europe Phenom Jet 300 comes in to land at London City Airport. London features in three of the top 10 flights . Aviation provider NetJets - which has the largest private jet fleet in the world - announced the findings of the annual report for 2013. Users of the luxury crafts, which often boast\u00a0private bedrooms, fine-dining facilities and the odd cinema, are typically private entrepreneurs, aged between 40 and 55. The aircraft provider said the United States remains the world\u2019s leading private jet market with 60 per cent of global traffic starting and ending there. Popular routes include Moscow to C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Miami to New York, New York to Los Angeles, New York to West Palm Beach and London to New York in the most recent data. Typical passengers:\u00a0American tycoon Donald Trump with daughter Ivanka Trump onboard his private jet as they arrive at Aberdeen Airport last year. Aviation data found flyers are often private entrepreneurs . Lap of luxury: The inside a Global 6000 reveals why those who can afford it are increasingly turning to the pricey form of transport . Europe has the second-largest market for those wanting to avoid the queues, with about a quarter of the US, with Russia representing a significant portion of overall European demand. But Marine Eugene, executive director for NetJets Europe, said the United States was way out in front when it came to private air traffic. 1. Moscow - Nice/C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur . 2. Miami - New York . 3. New York - Los Angeles . 4. New York - West Palm Beach . 5. London - New York . 6. London \u2013 Moscow . 7. London - Nice/C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur . 8. Chicago - New York . 9. Houston - New York . 10. West Palm Beach - New York . 1. Nice/Cote D Azur \u2013 Teterboro (NY) 2. Maiquetia \u2013 Miami . 3. Dubai - London . 4. Pittsburgh \u2013 Teterboro (NY) 5. Houston - West Palm Beach . 6. Moscow - Tel Aviv . 7. Houston \u2013 Midland (Texas) 8. Lagos - London . 9. Austin - Houston . 10. Houston \u2013 Washington . She said US businessman were more inclined to use the private transportation as they were 'driven by access' with huge expanses to be covered, often requiring more than one connection. 'If you are a very busy businessman having to connect between flights for meetings, it can be difficult to get where you need to go and at a time you need to be there,' she said. 'In the US there are no business flights and you really don't have the service that you would expect if you are a very busy person. 'With private flights, you can decide what time you want to set off and arrive, at a time that suits the individual and their business needs.' Moscow was among the top 10 routes with highest hours flown in 2013, although the political crisis of late has seen numbers fall by 15 per cent in recent months. No toy: Often seen as a play thing of the rich and the famous like John Travolta pictured, private jets are now regarded as vital business tool . Popular destination: London ranks highly with private jet passengers, according to research by aviation experts NetJets . Elsewhere, private air traffic between London and New York continues to increase year on year with the UK capital accounting for a third of the most frequented routes. Within London, London City Airport has seen significant increases traffic over the last year. The airport is seen as an important hub, particularly for those that work in the financial sector, given its close proximity to Canary Wharf and the city in general. Dubai and the broader UAE are seeing growing traffic although the Middle East\u2019s position as the world\u2019s third-largest market is being challenged by the rise of traffic in China and Brazil. The data showed traffic from Brazil to Europe has grown by a fifth each year since 2010 with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal amongst the most popular destinations. The total business jet market in China still below Europe, estimated at 20,000 flights per year, with potential for significant growth predicted in its domestic flights. Nigeria has also become one of the fastest growing hubs with private departures to and from Lagos. Experts have put the steady global rise down to more travelers rating the plush transport as a vital business tool. Industry figures claim the flights are often cost effective for businessmen, giving them the swift access needed to\u00a0close deals, often worth huge sums of money. The ability to get anywhere, at any time, can be priceless when it comes to the limited leisure time most customers experience. 'It can be invaluable when you work really hard and want to spend time with family within a tight schedule,' said Ms Eugene. 'Businessmen are the ones that have the needs and the means to make it possible.'",

        "article": "Even the more well-travelled among us would struggle to scratch the surface of Unesco's World Heritage List. Jaw-dropping scenery, ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation. But while well-known destinations such as Machu Picchu and the Acropolis in Athens may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers' 'to do' list, there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see. Here, we highlight a number of Unesco World Heritage sites that due to conflict, or deterioration, risk being lost to us forever - as well as a few destinations that you may be able to see for yourself... but only if you're quick. Scroll down for video . The UNESCO World Heritage sites you may never get to see: . Afghanistan - Minaret of Jam . The glorious Minaret of Jam has was built in the 12th century by\u00a0Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din and marks the ancient city of Firuzkuh . The Minaret - in the Ghor province in Afghanistan - is covered in intricate brickwork and blue tiles arranged in Kufic inscription . It has survived countless wars and pillaging  the but Minaret of Jam - situated in a remote spot in the Ghor province of Afghanistan - is facing its biggest challenge yet. Extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure, which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt, similar to the tower at Pisa. The 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din, and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as Kufic inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the Minaret. Not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement, it lies in a dangerous Taliban stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible. North-West Iraq - Samarra Archaeological City . The Great Mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated . The archaelogical city at Samarra in Northern Iraq marks the site of a powerful Islamic capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century. The Great Mosque and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds. The city is located in the North-West of Iraq which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia, Isis and Kurdish forces. When, and indeed if, the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful. Ancient city of Aleppo - Syria . The city of Aleppo was named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today . The Grand Mosque in the ancient city of Aleppo is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country . Syria's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape. The ancient city of Aleppo contains elaborate mosques, palaces and evidence of a Graeco-Roman street layout, and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th-century BC. Hinting at its former glory, the city was even named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today.The country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating, and the Foreign Office advises against all travel to the war-torn country. Bethlehem - Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route . The Church of the Nativity is located within the Palestine occupied West Bank, an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid . The alleged birthplace of Jesus: Positioned in the Palestine occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' Six miles south of Jerusalem, on the site Christians have called the birthplace of Jesus since the 2nd century, is the Church of Nativity. The oldest church in daily use in the world, the original basilica  was built in 339 AD, and parts of it survive below ground. A cave, over which the first Church was built, is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. While the site sees streams of religious visitors, its positioning in the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' means it's not one for the average tourist. And even if you do get to it, the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair. And due to an increase in the number of vehicles, as well as unregulated tourism, pollution now affects its outside walls. Its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, so it remains at high risk. Timbuktu - Mali . Timbuktu was founded in the 5th century and came to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries when it was a centre for learning . Desertification has left many of Timbuktu's buildings vulnerable, while political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel . Remote, yet endlessly fascinating, Timbuktu  has become synonymous with inaccessibility over the centuries. Once hailed as the intellectual and spiritual capital of Islam in Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, today the city remains as distant and increasingly isolated. Founded in the 5th century, Timbuktu was previously a thriving economic and cultural hub in spite of its isolation, and the mosques and holy shrines in the city once played an essential role in the spread of Islam throuhgout Africa. Situated in the gateway to the Sahara desert, the ancient mosques and libraries of Timbuktu are under now at the mercy of the elements. Climate change and desertification has left many of the buildings vulnerable, and continued political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel. Democratic Republic of Congo - Kahuzi-Biega National Park . Kahuzi-Biega National Park (right) is home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas (left) - but only around 250 remain . The Kahuzi-Biega National Park covers a vast area of tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo that is dominated by two dormant volcanos - Kahuzi and Biega. The Park's diverse flora and fauna make it one of the most ecologically rich in the world, let alone Africa, and it's home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas. However, despite efforts to preserve the population, only 250 gorillas remain in the park at present, and poaching and political instability in the region have left the Park exposed to worrying levels of destruction. The country is virtually off-limits to travellers with the Foreign Office guidance advising against all but essential travel to most regions. And the endangered sites should visit before they disappear: . Belize - Barrier reef . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals and clear blue water . Coastal development and tourism also put pressure on the stunning, but fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be responsible . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals, crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches. It is also home to the a number of threatened species, including the West Indian manatee, hawksbill turtles and the American crocodile. However, much like the iconic Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the future of the reef in Belize is under constant threat from a number of factors including climate change, coral bleaching and the frequent hurricanes that blight the region. Coastal development and tourism have also put pressure on the stunning, but incredibly fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be a responsible tourist! Peru - Chimu Kingdom, Chan Chan . In its prime during the 15th century, the vast kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Columbian America . The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs . While Machu Picchu may be more well-known, the remains of the Chimu kingdom in Peru are just as fascinating. The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs, although the fragile nature of the earthen structures mean the site is slowing-but-surely eroding, so get there soon if you can. In its prime during the 15th century, the kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Colombian America and the remains of temples, dwellings, irrigation systems and funeral platforms can still be seen today. United Kingdom - Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City . Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on . A little closer to home, the city of Liverpool has a rich maritime heritage and was once a thriving commercial port. In the 18th and 19th centuries the city played an integral role in the growth the of British Empire - a legacy that remains to this day. During this time, the city pioneered the development of modern dock technology and transport systems, and was a major port for the mass emigration of people to America. Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on, despite the threat of urban sprawl and new developments that are unsympathetic to the vernacular of its historic buildings. Colombia - Los Katios National Park . Los Katios National Park is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir and the Giant Anteater (left) After years spent in the tourism doldrums, visitor numbers are finally on the increase in Colombia as the South American country enjoys a period of relative political calm. If you are planning a trip, consider a diversion to Los Katios National Park, which is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir - as well as incredible flora and fauna. Situated in the North West of the country, 95 per cent of the park is considered to be in pristine condition, but the threat of pollution, illegal hunting and agricultural sprawl remains an ever-present threat. Indonesia - Tropical rainforests of Sumatra . The parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger . This once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years due to illegal logging, among other things . The tropical rainforests in Sumatra comprises three national parks: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Collectively, the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger - and around 580 species of birds, making it an ideal destination for animal lovers. But this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years. The spread of illegal logging, encroaching agriculture and poaching have devastated some parts of the rainforest and still pose a significant threat.",

        "article": "Manny Pacquiao received a surprise visit from drug testers prior to his Fight of the Century with Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao was approached unannounced by an anti-doping examiner at the house he is renting in Los Angeles where he is preparing to face Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2. Both fighters can expect to be tested under the US Anti-Doping Association programme to which they have both signed up. Manny Pacquiao was paid a surprise visit by an anti-doping examiner on Sunday to take a drug test . Pacquiao has a plaster applied after giving a blood sample to the examiner . Pacquiao was visited only four days after the packed red-carpet media event in LA which formally launched the build up to the $350million richest fight of all time. The inspector called at the house, where Pacquiao was relaxing with members of his team between work-outs with master trainer Freddie Roach at the fabled Wild Card Gym . The PacMan readily complied with tests for both blood \u2013 a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike \u2013 and urine. \u2018No problem,\u2019 he told the medic, with a smile. Earlier, his promoter Bob Arum had made it clear that Pacquiao had issued a $5m challenge to Mayweather with regard to the testing, and offered to surrender that amount should he fail the examination. In addition to the giving blood, Pacquiao also gave a urine sample during the test . Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather can expected to be randomly tested before the bout on May 2 in Las Vegas . Arum explained: \u2018Manny proposed that if either of them did not pass a test, that man should pay the other $5m. \u2018Floyd\u2019s team declined. Not because anybody here is afraid of the outcome but because they realised they could legally get a lot more if it happened. \u2018Fine with Manny. If Floyd fails we will be looking for much more compensation than $5m.' Pacquiao has already been paid damages \u2013 reportedly in seven figures \u2013 after taking legal action for remarks made by members of the Mayweather team, when they began demanding drugs-testing, which inferred that he might have used performance enhancing drugs in the past. Under the US procedures, which comply with the World Anti-Doping Agency standards applied for the Olympics, both boxers must submit to random testing in the weeks leading up to the fight and to another immediately after the event. Pacquiao was happy to be filmed by a camera crew from the Philippines, who are documenting the build up . Pacquiao proposed that if either boxer failed a drug test they would have to pay the other $5million . Pacquiao has had to overcome an element of paranoia that a loss of blood prior to fights might weaken him in the ring. But he is so cool about testing now that he allowed video-taping of Sunday\u2019s test by a Philippines camera crew which is filming virtually his every move between now and fight night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Mayweather has campaigned vociferously in the last two years for the implementation of random blood testing for all fights. However, with a split purse of up to $180m for Mayweather and $120m for Pacquiao at stake, it seems inconceivable that either man would even remotely risk detection. Pacquiao has been documenting his training , seen here going fr a road run on the streets of LA . Mayweather hits the speed bag as his training camp continues in his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time . VIDEO Mayweather and Pacquiao camps exchange verbal blows . Not all boxers make hundreds of millions of dollars for risking their lives in the ring. Compared with the most lucrative pickings ever which await Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2, our own Michael Watson was on a modest stipend when he climbed through the ropes to fight Chris Eubank. That London evening in 1991 ended with Watson suffering crippling brain damage. It is nothing short of a miracle, made possible by rapid and brilliant medical intervention, that Watson has survived to celebrate his 50th birthday, let alone along the way complete a London Marathon in six days with the ever-supportive Eubank for company. Michael Watson (centre), pictured fighting Chris Eubank in 1991, turned 50 on Sunday . The bout left Watson with crippling brain damage and there will be a fund-raining dinner to celebrate his 50th . To celebrate Watson\u2019s half-century, which he turned on Sunday, a fund-raising dinner will be held in London next month to help pay for the constant care he needs. The Teenage Cancer Trust will benefit, also. David Haye and Joe Calzaghe will be among many star British boxers in attendance at The Park Lane Hotel on St George\u2019s Day, April 23, along with American legend Marvin Hagler.

        "article": "(CNN)History has repeated itself at Indian Wells with the surprise withdrawal of Serena Williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury. Williams' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister Venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott, amid claims of racism, that only ended this year. Williams had been due to play Romanian Simona Halep on Friday night, but instead posted news of her withdrawal on Instagram. \"Four months ago I began a journey to play Indian Wells and it was amazing. I never dreamed I could do it. But I would not have been able to do this without my fans. Though it ended early due to injury this year, I have to say I cannot wait to try again next year. Thanks everyone. I love you so much!\" Williams posted. Back in 2001, crowds booed a young Serena as she took on Belgian Kim Clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the BNP Paribas Open. Despite being on home soil, spectators backed Clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster Pam Shriver said were difficult to watch. \"You would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the U.S. player, so it clearly was the exact opposite. Because she was American, because she was so young, because she was African-American, predominantly white audience. It was tough, it was tough to listen to,\" Shriver told CNN's Open Court. Shriver watched as spectators booed Serena's father Richard and sister Venus, as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match. \"That's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals,\" Shriver said. Minutes before the highly-anticipated semifinal between the two sisters, Venus pulled out due to a knee injury. Her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors, which the family denies, that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father, who kept a tight control on his daughters' careers. Despite the booing, Williams beat Clijsters to take the title. But the issue did not end there. Days later, Richard Williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse, Bill Dwyre, who covered the match for L.A. Times told Open Court. \"Richard Williams had said that the n-word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated. ... that was the beginning of Serena never coming back.\" After 14 years of refusing to play at Indian Wells, Serena Williams, who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade, said that she was \"following her heart\" by deciding to rejoin the tournament. \"In order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything,\" she told reporters at a pre-match news conference.  Serena said she discussed it with her father in a \"really emotional\" conversation and he agreed. \"He said it would be a big mistake if I didn't go back and I thought that was really admirable,\" Williams said. Before the match, she told reporters that, by returning, she felt like she'd already won. \"I don't think I need to hold the trophy at the end of it. I feel like I'm already holding the trophy. I've never felt that way before,\" she said. \"Just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it's a wonderful feeling.\" Williams' early exit gives Halep a free pass to the final.",

        "article": "Sophie Brannan, 11, was killed when she was hit by Christopher Hannah in November last year . A heroin addict is facing a long jail sentence after he admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit and run crash while on bail. Christopher Hannah was high on drugs when he ploughed into Sophie Brannan, her friend and her friend\u2019s uncle as they walked home from local shops on November 14 last year. Hannah, 33, lost control of his hired Vauxhall Astra, mounted the pavement and hit the three victims so hard from behind they were thrown over the car. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury. Hannah, the son of a bankrupt businessman, fled the scene in Sandbank Street in Glasgow\u2019s Maryhill \u2013 but later called a friend to say he had been \u2018driving like a madman\u2019 and had hit someone. At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, the father of three pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and was remanded in custody for sentence next month. The court heard Hannah\u2019s car, which he had hired a month earlier, mounted the pavement and hit the gable end of a nearby building before careering into Sophie and her companions. Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: \u2018This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground. Another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor Sophie.\u2019 Witnesses saw Hannah speed into Maryhill Road, with his badly dented car being \u2018driven erratically\u2019 before he crashed into a taxi. The cab driver tailed Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away. Mr Nicol said: \u2018At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper, then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off. \u2018Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance.\u2019 Paramedics took Sophie to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. Tributes left at the scene after the crash last year.\u00a0Hannah fled scene but pleaded guilty at High Court in Glasgow yesterday . She remained in intensive care overnight, but died the following day. The court heard Sophie\u2019s friend suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy. Mr Nicol said: \u2018She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts. She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.\u2019 The girl\u2019s uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later. However, he eventually required surgery and is likely to have \u2018long-term restriction\u2019 in movement to his right shoulder. The court heard Hannah stayed on the run for two days after Sophie\u2019s death, despite promising his partner he would hand himself in. When police finally arrested him, they found heroin hidden inside his boxer shorts. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury . Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for the crash. They said he took \u2018a conscious decision\u2019 to drive while impaired and failed to stop because he knew he had taken drugs and was \u2018aware of the ramifications\u2019. Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin. He has 14 previous convictions for crimes including possessing an offensive weapon and road traffic charges and was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow\u2019s Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash. Hannah\u2019s advocate Thomas Ross said: \u2018He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.\u2019",

        "article": "A woman who spent eight years desperately searching for her mother has finally found her after a selfie of her wearing a large 'Find My Mum\u2019 message board went viral on Facebook. Stacey Lee had become separated from Brenda Drake in 1993 when she was just two years old after a family breakdown and she went to live with her father and two brothers. Aged 15, the schoolgirl desperately wanted to find her mother and began trawling through the electoral roll, Facebook and the internet in a bid to find her. Scroll down for video . Stacey Lee decided to make a last ditch bid to find her mother by posting this picture on Facebook . At long last: An emotional 23-year-old Stacey hugs her mother Brenda for the first time in 21 years . After eight years of being met with dead ends, 23-year-old Stacey was resigned to the fact that she would never see her mother again. However, Stacey's boyfriend, 22-year-old Martin Smith, encouraged her to create a message board made out of cardboard with her mother\u2019s name on it along with details such as her birth date and the hospital where she was born. Stacey's friend then took a photograph of her holding the message board and posted it to her Facebook page sparking the image to be shared more than 100,000 times. Within 20 hours, Stacey had a call from a woman who said she might be her cousin and put her in touch with 46-year-old Brenda on the social media network. The Facebook messages which will lead to mother and daughter being reunited at last . Later the pair were reunited during a tearful meeting at a pub near Brenda's home in Blackpool, Lancashire. \u2018When I clicked on my mum\u2019s Facebook profile I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 she looked just like me!\u2019 said Stacey, who lives in Chorley. \u2018I sent her a message and told her that I had missed her and that I wanted to build a relationship with her. \u2018She sent me her phone number and I called her. I was shaking as I dialled the number and I just sat staring at the phone for 15 minutes before I made the call. \u2018Mum told me that she had four other children and that she had always thought about me and my older brothers. A teary-eyed Stacey is reunited with her mother, Brenda, and meets sister Shannon, for the first time . \u2018We cried together on the phone. It was very emotional and I was so happy that I had finally found her. \u2018I arranged to go and meet my mum the following day in Blackpool. My arms felt like jelly for the whole journey. \u2018I went to meet her in a pub and when I saw her I just hugged her and we both cried. We were in shock. It was very emotional. We look a lot like each other and I am quite shy and quiet like her.\u2019 Stacey said she had never seen a photograph of her mother, and although she knew her name was Brenda Elizabeth Davies and that she had been born in Leyland, she didn\u2019t know her age. \u2018Growing up I had always wondered about my mum,\u2019 said Stacey. \u2018I was born in Manchester but when I was two I went to go and live with my dad, David, then two years later I moved to Runcorn to live with my granddad and two brothers. 'As I approached my teenage years, I always thought about my mum. Martin Smith came up with the idea for Stacey to post the photograph on Facebook which was shared 100,000 times and help reunite mother and daughter in just 20 hours . 'My friends had good relationships with their mums and I often wondered what it would be like to have a mother-daughter relationship. 'Occasions like Mother\u2019s Day and Christmas Day were particularly difficult and when I reached the age of 16 I started looking for my mum on Facebook and the electoral roll. 'When I first met my partner, Martin, five years ago, I confided in him about my long-lost mother and he was so supportive. He's been my rock. 'There were times when I thought I would never be reunited with my mum. She could have passed away or moved abroad for all I knew. 'Last week Martin and I were talking about my mum again and he encouraged me to create a sandwich board and use it to look for her on Facebook. 'I had seen similar posts on social media and I just thought \"why not?\" I had nothing to lose. 'I wrote my birth date and the hospital I was born in along with my mum\u2019s full name and birth place. 'I knew my mum might have changed her name since I was born but it was worth a shot.' Ten hours after posting the picture to her Facebook profile, the image had been shared 100,000 times, and the next day Stacey was contacted by Kerianne Davies, a friend she had known in her teenage years. Stacey said: 'I received a Facebook message from a girl I had known when I was younger. She told me that she had some information about my mum, and that she was my cousin. I was so confused, but it turned out that her father was my mum\u2019s brother. 'I used to go round to Kerianne\u2019s house a lot when I was a teenager, so it turned out that I had known my uncle all along! Lots to talk about: Stacey and sister Shannon share details of their lives after growing up apart . 'It was unbelievable, I couldn\u2019t believe that I had known some of my relatives. Kerianne had the same surname as my mum\u2019s maiden name but we never put two-and-two together because Davies is quite a common surname.' Stacey was told her mother had changed her surname and after a quick search, found her mother\u2019s Facebook page and sent her a message. Within an hour Brenda had replied and the pair exchanged phone numbers. Brenda explained that she had changed her surname to Drake after getting married, and had moved to Blackpool soon after she had been separated from Stacey and her brothers Stuart, now 26, and Steven, now 25. She went on to have four more children, Shannon, 19, Shona, 15, Aaron, nine, and Sabrina, eight. Stacey kisses Martin who she has described as 'her rock' throughout her search . Brenda said she was delighted to finally have been able to see Stacey again and had also searched for her and her two sons. 'I regret losing contact with my three eldest children,' said Brenda. 'I thought about them a lot, especially at times like Christmas. 'I tried looking for them but I always came to a dead end. I always thought that they would come looking for me when they turned 16 but I never heard anything from them. 'When I received the Facebook message from Stacey, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. 'She was so beautiful and I just couldn\u2019t wait to meet her. 'Stacey is so sweet and adorable and my other children were so pleased to find out they had an older sister. 'We're all looking forward to the future and I am going to be reunited with my two sons Stuart and Steven too.' Stacey and Brenda have a look at the Facebook post which reunited them after 21 years .",

Research into the nation's caffeine habits by Roy Morgan Research found there's nothing more Australians love than fresh coffee, with the average person's caf\u00e9 visits increasing by three per cent between 2010 and 2014. Although Sydney was found to have the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee, the Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital. Sydney was foudn to have the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee . Instead, it's Melburnians which can proudly claim the title, with 63.3 per cent of people aged 14 and over visiting a caf\u00e9 for coffee or tea in an average three month period. This was followed closely by Sydney at 61 per cent and Hobart at 62.7 per cent. Melbourne residents were also found to visit cafes more frequently with 11.5 per cent of people going 16 or more times in a three-month period. Research into the nation's caffeine habits by Roy Morgan Research found there's nothing more Australians love than fresh coffee . The Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital: Sydney's Cornersmith cafe in Marrickville won The Good Food Guides's best cafe award in the city in 2014 . 'With a higher caf\u00e9 visitation rate than any other capital city, Melburnians take their coffee very seriously,' Roy Morgan Research's Group Account Director, Angela Smith, said. 'And perhaps because so many of them count on their barista for their caffeine fix, Melbourne residents don't need to buy as much fresh coffee for home/work consumption \u2013 which is where Sydneysiders lead the country.' Meanwhile, instant coffee's popularity is steadily decreasing across the country according to the research which also found an 8.7 per cent rise in the number of households with coffee makers. Melbourne residents visit cafes more frequently than in any other city: The Good Food Guides's 2014 best cafe award in Melbourne went to Top Paddock in Richmond (pictured) Perth residents are particularly fond of their home brews with the capital city recording the highest rate of coffee-maker ownership at 39 per cent. 'While a much higher proportion of Aussies still buy instant coffee than fresh, its popularity has been declining for several years,' Ms Smith said. 'However, all is not lost: instant-coffee brands Moccona and Robert Timms are actually bucking this downward trend, with higher purchase rates in 2014 than in 2010. Meanwhile, Lavazza maintains top spot among the fresh coffee brands.'",

The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread, which they could then share with friends on social media. But  the words 'lesbian', 'Jewish' and 'orangutan' are all banned from being emblazoned on the pots,\u00a0it has been discovered. A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian' (file picture) The Nutella website says: 'Here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love.' But users realised that there is a long list of words banned, which bizarrely does not allow 'lesbian' but permits the word 'gay'. The word 'Christian' can also be written on the jars, but other religious terms such as 'Jewish' and 'Muslim' have been banned by Nutella, Pink News\u00a0reported. The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread . Health-related terms, presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity, have also been banned, including the words 'cancer' and 'diabetes'. The company, owned by Ferrero, has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil, the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans. This may explain why 'boycott' and 'orangutan' make the long list of banned words. Ferrero said in a statement: 'By giving customers the opportunity to personalise their Nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand. 'Negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field. Similarly, terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities.' The news comes just a day after it emerged that Marks & Spencer had banned the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers. The policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a \u00a335 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in 'Christ Church Teddington'. Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, said: 'If Christ becomes an offensive word in a Christian land then all of us should be alarmed.'",

The actress raised the heckles of Trekkies Sunday when she wrote a tribute on Twitter seemingly honoring a real-life celebrity child psychologist instead of the fictional science officer of USS Enterprise portrayed by the late actor Leonard Nimoy. 'Rest in peace Dr. Spock ... Xxxooo,' Alley wrote in a message accompanying a black-and-white still photograph of Nimoy as the half-Vulcan first officer under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. Scroll down for video . Twitter gaffe:\u00a0Kirstie Alley has been called out by Star Trek fans for calling Leonard Nimoy's character 'Dr Spock' instead of 'Mr Spock' Wrong Spock: The actress (left) accidentally paid tribute to Dr Benjamin Spock (right), a celebrity child psychoanalyst who died in 1998 . The vintage image also features a young Kirstie Alley as the Romulan Lieutenant Saavik, who appears to be going in for a kiss with Nimoy's stone-faced Spock in the 1982\u00a0Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan. Alley was later replaced in the role by the actress Robin Curtis. The 64-year-old TV and film actress unwittingly eulogized Dr Benjamin Spock, a famed pediatric psychoanalyst and the author of the mega best-seller Baby and Child Care who passed away in 1998 at age 94. Fans of the successful science fiction franchise Star Trek wasted no time pointing out Alley\u2019s mistake.

Another Star Trek fan Julie Smith wrote: 'ROFL Dr. Spock gave our parents advice about how to take care of us!' But others have come to Alley's defense, insisting that the actress' slip-up was just an innocent mistake. Alley, who was out of the country when Leonard Nimoy passed away Friday at age 83, defiantly responded to the flurry of tweets about her gaffe about an hour later. Outspoken: Alley, 64, has defended her tweet in a follow-up message, insisting that honorary titles notwithstanding, the sentiment was the same . Live Long and Prosper: Nimoy passed away Friday after a long battle with lung disease. He was 83. 'I'm sure Mr. Spock had PHD's in Science...anyway the sentiment is the same..jeez...hard to make gestures on here without Trek police..RIP,' she retorted. Nimoy, who played Mr Spock for 47 years, was laid to rest Sunday in Los Angeles following an intimate ceremony attended by family and close friends.",

        "article": "Self-styled revolutionary Russell Brand believes  Britain's 'corrupt' society is to blame for turning Jihadi John into a terrorist executioner. In an extraordinary ten-minute rant on YouTube, the outspoken millionaire comedian young Muslims in the UK are so disenfranchised they \u2018turn to mad jihadism\u2019. The millionaire comedian-turned-anarchist spoke out in a video blog he called: 'Could I have been Jihadi John?' He said: \u2018The kernel of truth in the sprawling, bewildering, bramble of ISIS madness is society isn't working, the system isn't working, it\u2019s totally corrupt. Scroll down for video . Controversial comedian Russell Brand posted an extraordinary ten-minute rant on YouTube saying Britian's society was to blame for turning Jihadi John into a terrorist executioner . \u2018That\u2019s the thing that resonates in the core of young people, that\u2019s the thing that pulls them into mad jihadism.\u2019 And he went on to muse: \u2018The developing news narrative in most of its permutations doesn't address the core problems. 'If Muslims have been here in significant numbers since the fifties, why is this only happening now?\u2019 And he heaped blame on society at large for failing to incorporate and understand the ISIS atrocities. Brand explained that while society can 'incorporate' problems like drugs, drink and homelessness, it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way. 'The beheadings can\u2019t be incorporated into the main narrative of apathy, alienation, isolation,\u2019 he said. In the outburst, Brand also accused the media of failing to address the 'core problem' behind the ISIS atrocities . Brand also explained that while society can 'incorporate' problems like drugs, drink and homelessness, it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way . \u2018It\u2019s merely an extreme example of something that is commonly understood. That our cultural story at the moment makes no sense. \u2019 In the outburst he also accused the media of failing to address the 'core problem' behind the ISIS atrocities. However, it is not the first time that Brand has spoken out about ISIS. In another Youtube rant in September, he argued that attitudes in Britain towards Muslim youth are to blame for men and women leaving the UK to join extremists abroad. Meanwhile in December, he took aim at the Australian government and Prime Minister Tony Abbot following a siege at a cafe in Sydney where two people died. Mohammed Emwazi, left, who was revealed to be ISIS executioner Jihadi John. Brand suggested that not incorporating Muslims into British society is the reason they turn to ISIS . Brand previously criticised Australian media for calling the Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, pictured, a terrorist, saying he was simply a 'mentally ill criminal' Brand criticised the way gunman Man Haron Monis was branded a terrorist by some media outlets, saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal. 'This man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability,' Brand said in a video. The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about ISIS. He added: 'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIS because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.'",

The Reds are currently fifth in the Premier League table with 54 points, just two behind United in fourth. Having both spent heavily in the summer transfer window, both teams are under huge pressure to secure Champions League football next season and while previous meetings between the two sides may have been contested higher up the table, this year's encounter still has plenty at stake, given the broadcasting revenue linked to Europe's top club competition.

Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel poses with a camera at the club's Melwood ahead of Sunday's clash with United . All too aware of what is at stake is Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge, who believes that three points and momentum in the race for a top-four finish will render the local bragging rights associated with the fixture as incidental. He told Liverpoolfc.com: 'Of course, it's a rivalry, but it's another three points and we'll just approach the game as we always do - that's the most important thing. 'It's going to be a big game for us. We're going into the game looking to win it, as we always do, and we're looking forward to it. 'We'll go into this game with the right mentality, we'll look to play our football and to try to go out there and win the game.

Meanwhile, Sturridge was full of praise for attacking dynamo Philippe Countinho, whose development this season have been central to an upturn in form for Liverpool, who have not lost in their last 13 league games, since the 3-0 defeat by United in December. On Coutinho, Sturridge said, 'He's great to play with. He's very skilful, sees a pass and scores very nice goals, also, so it's a pleasure to play with him. 'He's quite chilled, he's not too loud. He has a little bit of a joke, but he's just a relaxed, calm guy. He comes in and does his work and is humble, just like everyone else is. 'I think it's down to him to work as hard as he possibly can to get to where he wants to be - and I am sure he wants to aim for the stars. 'That's very possible with the attributes he has, so as long as he continues doing what he's doing, I'm sure he'll go a long way in the game.'

        "article": "A mysterious San Antonio 'priest' is offering to absolve sins digitally - by taking confessions using Snapchat. However, the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy, who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app, which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them. Despite @priestDavid claiming he wants to make confession easier, others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger, who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest. Available to hear your confession: Christian priests in San Antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @priestDavid . 'It's not confession. It's not what the sacrament is all about,' said local San Antonio priest, the Reverend Tony Vilano to News 4 in San Antonio. 'He's not a Catholic priest. The church teaches when you go to confession, you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face.' While it is not known what Christian denomination @priestDavid is, he claims the Snapchat confession is part of a college student's project he is helping with. He also told News 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23-years. The confessions will be heard for two weeks from March 2 to March 16. Unethical: Confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face-to-face . Traditional: This is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years . 'Doing it Snapchat, I mean, you can do Snapchat or through the internet and list everything you've done and there's no humility in there. There's no ownership of the sins you've committed,' said Rev. Vilano to News 4. Others are more damning of @priestDavid. Archdiocese of San Antonio Deacon Pat Rodgers vehemntly disagrees with using Snapchat for confessions. He said that in fact the man, if he is a priest, has gone rogue and that confessions must take place face-to-face. News 4 in San Antonio took to the street to ask the public their opinions. 'Ridiculous. Absurd. That's what the Catholic church is for. Internet is not reality. You want confession, go see a priest,' said Richard de Leon III to News 4. In a statement, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas said: 'The Episcopal Diocese of West Texas recognizes there are various ways churches can reach out to people through social media. However, Episcopalians are not asked to present private confessions to a priest, instead confession is offered in worship, as part of the church's liturgy.'",

Police have charged the former Pop Idol judge, known as Doctor Fox, with nine offences involving six alleged victims, three of whom were allegedly aged under 16 at the time. Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, today said he 'categorically denies' all the allegations. Scroll down for video . DJ Neil Fox (pictured outside his west London home today) has been charged with nine sex offences against six alleged victims, including three who were allegedly aged under 16 at the time . It comes following his arrest in September last year, then again in December and earlier this month. In a statement, Anthony Burton said: 'It is wholly inappropriate at this stage for Mr Fox to make any comment, save that he categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him.' The charges relating to the three girls are alleged to have taken place between 1991 and 1996. The other three women were allegedly attacked by Fox between 2003 and 2014. Mr\u00a0Fox, who is currently suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM, was first arrested in connection with the inquiry at the radio studios in September last year, before being taken to a central London police station. Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, said he 'categorically denies' the allegations . The DJ was arrested again in December over three alleged sexual assaults involving different women. Scotland Yard said he was arrested again earlier this month after voluntarily attending Charing Cross police station in London in connection with an alleged sexual assault against another victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s. Mr Fox has now been charged with one count of indecent assault on a female aged under 14 and two counts of indecent assault on females aged under 16. In relation to the more recent allegations, he is charged with four counts of indecent assault on a female over 16 and two counts of sexual assault on females. A Scotland Yard spokesman added that the charges had not been brought as\u00a0part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile probe into alleged sexual offences sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. Police said Mr Fox will appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on April 16. Lawyers for DJ Neil Fox, a former Pop Idol judge from Fulham, south west London, today said he 'categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him' Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

The police match commander in charge of Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the Hillsborough disaster. During the inquest into the deaths today, David Duckenfield also admitted that he 'froze' on the day in question, while Paul Greaney QC suggested that a child of 'average intelligence' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion. Up to 2,000 fans entered Hillsborough stadium's Gate C, with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. They then continued to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing. Mr Greaney reminded Mr Duckenfield of his earlier evidence to Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, about his state of mind after the opening of Gate C when he told her: 'It was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step. My mind for a moment went blank.' Asked again if he 'froze', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It appears to be a distinct possibility.' Mr Greaney said: 'You know what was in your mind and I will ask just one last time. Will you accept that in fact you froze?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney went on: 'Do you agree with the following, that people died in a crush in the central pens?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred?' The witness repeated: 'Yes sir.' Liverpool supporters were crushed to death during an FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 . Liverpool supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice . The barrister continued: 'That closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said again: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I did fail to recognise that sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'And therefore failed to take steps to achieve that.' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did sir.' A young Liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the Hillsborough pitch . Mr Greaney said: 'That failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Earlier Mr Duckenfield had claimed he was unaware of the geography of Sheffield Wednesday's ground, this being his first match in charge, and denied that he 'bottled it'. Mr Greaney, representing the Police Federation, put it the retired police chief: 'Do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be?' Thousands of Liverpool fans hold up scarves during a Hillsborough memorial service at Anfield last year . Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did not think of it on the day, sir, because of the pressure I was under.' Mr Greaney asked: 'Is the explanation of your failures Mr Duckenfield not that you were ignorant of the geography for example but rather that you knew the geography, you knew what the consequences might be of people entering the crowd but you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'I am not in a position to make that judgment, sir. Others should make that judgment.' Mr Greaney continued: 'You bottled it. You panicked and you failed to take the action that you knew needed to be taken to avoid consequences that you had foreseen. Now does that describe your state at the time?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I disagree with you sir.' A shirt of local rivals Everton is among thousands of flower tributes laid at Anfield shortly after the disaster . 'Why?' asked Mr Greaney. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because that's my view.' The barrister said: 'Why is it your view?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because it is my view and there can be no other view than mine.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you accept that might thought to be a rather arrogant thing to say?' The witness replied: 'Sir I apologise. If that appears arrogant I didn't mean that to be so.' The inquests have heard that Mr Duckenfield told the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were 'grave'. Chair of the Hillsborough Families For Justice, Margaret Aspinall, arrives at the inquest last week . He has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths. Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it was 'totally unacceptable' that a match commander 'did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making'. He also accepted that when giving evidence to Lord Justice Taylor it appeared that he was aware that the congested Leppings Lane turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel. Mr Duckenfield said he did not want to go into detail about his 'personal circumstances' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but it may have been he was 'confused' when giving evidence in 1989. Supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the Anfield gates in Liverpool after the disaster in 1989 . Mr Greaney said: 'The other possibility that I put to you is that you did at the time know much more about the geography of that ground and you are seeking to conceal that knowledge from this jury.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I can assure you, sir, I had no idea where fans would go from A to G (turnstiles) or the opening of Gate C.' Mr Greaney pointed out that Mr Duckenfield could have looked at a plan of the ground layout in the police control box before opening the gate at 2.52pm and that he could have consulted a fellow senior colleague with greater experience of the ground. A memorial service is held at Liverpool's Anfield ground on the April 15, 1989 anniversary of the disaster . The barrister told the court that another officer who was in the control box, who was operating the CCTV cameras, had earlier told the jury that he thought Mr Duckenfield was 'not a leader in that control room during that critical period'. Mr Greaney asked Mr Duckenfield: 'Do you agree that (the officer) was describing a match commander who had frozen?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'It is a possibility, sir, but that is his view and I cannot comment further.' Mr Greaney said: 'Can you not tell us whether on that day in that situation you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'Sir, I think it is fair to say that we were all in a state of shock.' Duckenfield agreed with Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to shift blame for his failings . Mr Greaney said: 'You were the one whose job it was to get past any feelings of shock, do you agree?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes, sir, but I am human.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you agree that you failed to offer any true leadership in that situation on that day?' The witness replied: 'That is not my view.' Earlier, Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to try to shift blame for his own failings to officers under his own command. The retired chief superintendent of South Yorkshire Police has previously said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the West Stand overlooking the Leppings Lane terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them. But he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so. The Hillsborough Memorial at Anfield has been relocated during the redevelopment work on the stadium .

Pictured with a fish in its mouth, this bear was seen thrashing around in an effort to keep the catch under control . Wildlife photographer, Sergey Ivanov, 52, spent days photographing the bears hunting at Kuril Lake in Kronotsy Reserve, Russia . Slippery customer: The cub wrestles with the huge fish as a parent stands in the river nearby . Amusingly, the bear's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission. But although the feisty fish was nearly equal in size to the little cub, the youngster managed to win the battle to bag himself a hearty lunch. After finding a secluded spot near the river, the cub then tried to tuck into its supper in peace but it wasn't long before its brother wondered over to see the impressive catch for himself. Sergey said: 'I'd been watching this bear family for some time and I had spent a few days around them.

Ivanov said 'The lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that's why the bears look so well, they don't even sleep in the winter until late January because they have plenty to eat' Fight on a grand scale: The bear cub just can't seem to get a grip on its prey and looks up anxiously for support . 'I was not really far from them, probably no more than 50 metres and after a few days they get used to your presence and pay you little attention. 'The lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that's why the bears look so well, they don't even sleep in the winter until late January because they have plenty to eat. 'But considering the fact that the lake is full of fish, I have never seen such a small bear tackle such a big fish. It was pretty hilarious to watch him trying to cope with a fish as big as this one. 'I even remember laughing out loud when I saw this through my viewfinder. 'But the bear is a strong animal, even the cubs, and it finally managed to win the fight.

However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing. As the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave, the baby is all smiles at the motion . Just chilling: Jorge Tirado, 43, floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves . Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age. Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.",

Van Gaal will be taking charge of a team at Anfield for the first time in his career and it will also be a new experience for several of his players, like Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao. They have not been short of advice, however, with Ryan Giggs and the team chef preparing them for what to expect. Louis van Gaal has revealed that the Man United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash against Liverpool . The occasion is set to be even more highly-charged than usual with both teams competing for a Champions League place and just two points separating them in the Premier League table. Van Gaal said: \u2018I have always my assistant manager to say that to me. And he said that also to the players in his presentation of the analysis of Liverpool but I also have the cook, Mike, and he is saying that every day to the players and to me. \u2018I like that because that shows that it is a very particular match especially for the fans of Manchester United and it helps also to focus and concentrate on this match.

        "article": "The key to a happy home is regular meals together, more than one tablet computer and a Netflix account, a new study has revealed. Research into the  lives of 2,000 British families found that traditional values such as regular heart-to-hearts, hugs and knowing when to say sorry were still important factors for domestic bliss. But the study also revealed that modern families believed that having modern technology and gadgets such as a Netflix account, fast wi-fi and Sky TV were also key to\u00a0harmonious home life. A new study has found that one of the keys to domestic bliss is having more than one tablet computer per household (picture posed by models) Monthly trips to the cinema, a good coffee machine for mum and dad and at least three televisions were also deemed necessities for happiness. The research, commissioned by British manufacturer Origin, found the highest rated tips for domestic bliss included eating together regularly, laughing a lot and keeping the home tidy. Despite the importance of eating together proving the most popular source for a happy family, a third said they rarely find time to do this. A quarter of families also felt they haven't got a good work/life balance with the average family getting less than 12 hours a week together. Andrew Halsall, Managing Director at Origin, said: 'The list of things that people attribute to happiness at home is an interesting mix of traditional processes, efforts to create a warm environment blended with the presence of technology and modern comforts. The whole family regularly eating together topped the list of things that helped create a harmonious family life . 'It's nice to see that eating together is still seen as the biggest sign of family bonding and a significant part of what people say makes a happy home. 'Modern life can be so hectic that families can struggle to get time together or ensure they appreciate their home life fully. People and their lifestyles change over time and homes need to be able to change with them. 'Whether it's through physical changes like extending or developing the property, or through making a conscious effort to do things together more, building that home environment clearly leads to happiness. After all, an Englishman's home is his castle.' The study also revealed that keeping the place tidy, cooking with the children and having in-jokes makes all the difference in fuelling a great home environment. Unsurprisingly, a dishwasher helped to avoid arguments about who is going to do the washing up, while a Netflix account was seen as an important factor in keeping the peace . Despite items such as fast wi-fi, Sky TV and everyone having their own smartphone or tablet, old fashioned bonding such as hugs and eating together were in the top five ways to keep a happy home . While a lock on the bathroom door, movie nights and well-lit rooms were also important factors to a house being free of doom and gloom. A good stack of board games, a comfortable sofa everyone can pile on and picking up clothes from the floor also goes a long way. Narrowly missing out on the top 50 elements for family happiness was the ability to share the remote control, having blinds to keep out nosy neighbours and a set of bi-fold doors opening out to the garden also help. More than two thirds of the families studied also felt that they were in definite need of more space at home. But children had other ideas when it came to essentials for a happy home with a tree house the most wished-for item, followed by a swimming pool in the garden and a bigger playroom. Andrew Halsall added: 'Space plays such a big part in creating a happy home environment.'Lack of adequate space for a household has also been shown to have significant impact on health, educational attainment and family relationships.' 1.

Well you\u2019re in luck, because a fresh mug of tea is now available at the touch of a button \u2013 from your coffee machine. Two British firms have joined forces to launch tea capsules which can be used in existing Nespresso machines. The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod made by Dualit \u2013 a brand best-known for its toasters and kettles. The Cornish Tea Company (pictured) will provide the leaves for a revolutionary tea capsule made by Dualit . Coffee drinkers have long enjoyed the merits of capsules, which provide instant hot drinks from machines made by Nespresso, Krups and Nescafe. But now tea drinkers can enjoy the same benefits with Dualit pods which are filled with tea from the family-run Cornish company. The pods are also compatible with Dualit\u2019s own range of coffee machines, but do not come cheap. A single cup of tea will cost 30p \u2013 15 times more than a typical 2p tea bag. Duncan Bond, director of the Cornish Tea Company, said: \u2018We are terrifically proud to be the first tea brand in the world to be launching a Nespresso-compatible capsule. It\u2019s never been done before and it has tremendous global potential. \u2018When tea bags were first introduced people said they\u2019d never catch on, now they are 97 per cent of the market. This could have a similar impact.\u2019 Mr Bond, who founded the business with his nephew in 2012, added: \u2018Many of our consumers lead very busy lives and this is not only incredibly convenient \u2013 the quality of the cup of tea is absolutely, scientifically consistent every time.\u2019 The pods were developed last year after High Court judges ruled Dualit\u2019s coffee capsules \u2013 which can also be used in Nespresso machines \u2013 did not infringe owner Nestle\u2019s patents. The tea capsules, made by Dualit (left) which is best known for its kettles and toasters, can be used in existing Nespresso machines (right) The decision has blown open the tea and coffee capsules market, and Dualit has invested \u00a31million in a new factory to meet the expected demand. The company started selling its own-brand tea capsules late last year but this is the first branded tea product to be made into a capsule. Dualit's Managing Director Leslie Gort-Barten said the Cornish Tea Company, based in Looe, Cornwall, was the perfect partner for the product. 'Cornish Tea are passionate, they are enthusiastic - they are player-managers in the same sense we are,' he said. 'The bigger a company gets, the more risk averse and blind to opportunity it can become. They weren't. 'I think Cornish Tea is a great company - it's a really good fit.'",

The millionaire gay father of a child brought up by a lesbian couple he donated sperm to must pay \u00a320,000 to cover their costs in an extraordinary triangular legal battle between the boy's three parents. The man - named in High Court papers as JF - helped the women have a child in 2007 but the mothers now say he is being too demanding over access to the\u00a0seven-year-old. After the boy was born JF - who has dual British and US citizenship and lives in a \u00a31.2million pound home in the South of England - had irregular contact with him and took him to America twice. But his relationship broke down with the mothers, who complained that the father had become 'increasingly individualistic and demanding about contact', the court heard. Today Mr Justice Mostyn - one of Britain's most senior family judges - ruled that in the absence of legal aid JF must pay 80 per cent of the mothers' costs as they continue to fight him in court. The judge blamed the Government's 'grossly unfair' legal aid cuts that mean the father should have to pay \u00a320,596 now, and 80 per cent of future costs run up by the women, known as MG and JG. 'But that it where the Government has left him. It is a sorry state of affairs,' added the judge. The boy's mothers,  who live in the North of England and are known only as MG, now 35, and JG, now 45, met in in 2005 and entered a civil partnership in July 2006. They wanted a child and responded to an entry by JF in a register for 'lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner' and accepted his sperm so they could have a child. MG carried the baby and gave birth in April 2007 and the couple agreed that JG became a legal step-parent and it was agreed all three would have legal rights to the boy - JFG - who was registered as an American citizen. Until October 2012 JF enjoyed periodic contact with his son and had even taken him to America with the two mothers on a couple of occasions. Turned sour: The seven-year-old boy is now at the centre of a bitter and expensive legal battle between his parents . In December 2013 JF issued an application in the High Court for more regular contact with his son, sparking an ongoing legal battle with the lesbian couple, who have since split up and run out of money. During eight court hearings legal costs have built up and the mothers have extended their mortgage to pay for it. But with 'modest means' they cannot afford any more. The judge said 'unfortunately' in April 2014 the two mothers separated but continue to work together in court. Under the old system both would have been entitled to legal aid, said the judge. But in April 2013 the Legal Aid, Sentence and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 ( LASPO) came into force. It removed legal aid from private law children proceedings and 'at a stroke, 63 years of state funding of cases such as this was swept away,' said the judge. Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'With the state washing its hands of MG and JG they now look to JF to fund their representation.' He said although the barristers in the case had reduced their fees they could not be expected to work for nothing. He added: 'So even though it cannot be said that JF has behaved reprehensibly or unreasonably he is the only realistic source of costs funding, subject to whatever contribution MG and JG should make from their own very limited resources. Some may say (and have said) that this is grossly unjust; I myself refrain from comment.' He said: 'Even though MG and JG are certainly not entitled to an order for costs they are entitled to seek an order for costs funding. To JF that may seem (with reason) to be a specious distinction without a difference, but that is where we find ourselves, now that the fourth pillar of the welfare state has been largely demolished.' Now the father must pay more than \u00a320,000 to the women the High Court battle will continue, with a ruling over access now likely later this year. An Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless. At the time legal aid reform began not only had this Government inherited an unprecedented financial crisis but our legal aid bill was one of the most expensive in the world at around \u00a32billion a year. 'We want to make sure family cases happen in the least divisive way possible, which is why we encourage people to use mediation and other out of court options that we know are less stressful and confrontational than going to court - and as a result are often more successful. 'It's for this reason we've significantly increased mediation funding and also recently announced new measures to give better support to those who decide to go to court and represent themselves. 'In some cases, though, court clearly is the only answer which is why, even after reform, we will still have one of the most generous legal aid system at around \u00a31.5 billion a year.'",

Inappropriate: Jamie Foxx has been accused of transphobia after making fun of Bruce Jenner's (right) reported gender transition at the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Awards held at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday. Foxx pictured on the left giving his monologue at the Sunday ceremony . A picture of Bruce Jenner flashed above Foxx the moment that he made the joke in front of the audience Sunday night . Speaking out: Perez Hilton lead a barrage of comments on Twitter accusing Foxx of being transphobic . Jamie then added: 'Look, I\u2019m just busting your balls while I still can.' Although Bruce has still yet to publicly discuss his rumored gender reassignment, it didn't stop host Foxx from receiving a backlash on Twitter over his remarks. Perez Hilton was first to tweet complaining: 'Boo! Shame on you #iHeartAwards for allowing @iamjamiefoxx to be transphobic on national television! Those #BruceJenner jokes were wrong!!!'. What he said: 'We have some groundbreaking performances here too tonight. We got Bruce Jenner, will be here doing some musical performances. He\u2019s doing a his and her duet all by himself.' Foxx pictured above in some eccentric costumes from the Sunday ceremony . According to a photo released before the event, Jenner's daughter Kylie was supposed to be in the audience Sunday night. It's unclear if she showed up, since she wasn't pictured on the red carpet Sunday night . Transition: Bruce Jenner - pictured in LA earlier this month - is reportedly undergoing gender reassignment surgery . Another Twitter user wrote: 'That transphobic joke about Bruce Jenner was not necessary & not funny at all #iHeartRadioMusicAwards.' Jenner's daughter Kylie was reportedly supposed to be attending the awards with her rapper boyfriend Tyga, \u00a0according to a picture posted before the event which showed placecards with their names attached to chairs at the venue.  However, it's unclear if she showed up to the event since Kylie wasn't spotted on the red carpet Sunday night. Daily Mail Online reached out to iHeartMedia and the production company which puts on the annual awards, Done + Dusted, for comment about the joke but we did not receive an immediate response. Despite not commenting publicly, there have been various reports about Bruce's transition, and that he has the full support of his children. A source close to the family recently told People that his sons Burt, Brandon and Brody are giving their dad their blessing, as well as step daughter Kim Kardashian. However, Kendall Jenner recently denied that she spoke about her father's transition, after a publication claimed she had said she would 'always love' Bruce whether 'he's a man or a woman'.",

        "article": "A police community support officer has been left devastated after arriving at the scene of a fatal crash and discovering the 10-year-old victim was her nephew. PCSO Lisa Crocker, 39, was on duty when she was called to the collision involving her young nephew Samuel Crocker in Crediton, Devon. The 'generous and kind' schoolboy was knocked down as he walked into the town centre to visit a friend on Saturday afternoon. He was taken to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter but later died from his injuries. His family said a 'bright light had been extinguished'. PCSO Lisa Crocker, 39 (right), was on duty when she was called to the collision involving her young nephew Samuel, 10 (left), who was knocked down while walking to meet a friend in Crediton, Devon, on Saturday . Cameron Trivett, 24, of Crediton, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision. He will appear at Exeter Crown Court later this month. It has now emerged that Mrs Crocker, who is part of Devon and Cornwall Police's neighbourhood team in Crediton, arrived at the scene to discover the victim was her brother's son. Chief Inspector Matt Lawler said: 'Clearly this is an absolute tragedy for the entire family. 'No-one in the force knew the connection until Lisa arrived at the scene and recognised Samuel. 'There has been a great deal of support locally for Lisa and many local people have been asking if she was personally connected to the incident. 'In order to allow her to focus on supporting her family, Lisa has asked us to confirm her involvement and thereby end the speculation. Mrs Crocker, 39, (pictured) was unaware her young nephew was involved in the collision until she arrived at the scene. The youngster later died in hospital . 'While she has been inundated with messages, Lisa would like everyone to focus on Samuel, not on her connection to the events of last Saturday.' Emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at about 1.30pm on Saturday after Samuel was struck by the white Vauxhall Combo van. Following his death, his family led an outpouring of tributes to him. In a statement, they said: 'On Saturday afternoon our life was turned upside down when our darling Samuel was knocked down while on his way to visit his friend. 'Later that night the bright light that was Samuel was extinguished. 'We all miss our little 'mole' so much and can't begin to imagine how we move on from the devastating situation we are in now. 'Someone so small has left a massive hole that can never be filled, but he will always be remembered for his cheeky, fun-loving nature and we are grateful to have had him in our lives, albeit for such a short time.' A book of condolence has since been opened at Landscore Primary School where Samuel was a pupil. Gary Read, the school's headteacher, said: 'Samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest, attentive, generous, loyal and kind. 'To be taken from his family and friends in this way feels incomprehensible.' Hundreds of people also attended a candle lit vigil at Holy Cross Church on Monday in memory of the youngster. Reverend Nigel Guthrie, Rector of Crediton, said: 'We wanted to give people a chance to express their feelings about what happened to Samuel. Samuel was walking to meet a friend in Crediton, Devon (pictured) when the collision occurred.\u00a0Cameron Trivett, 24, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision . 'It's a huge shock to the whole community as the family are so well-known and loved. 'There has been a very large response and we hope it can help bring everyone together in the wake of it.' The Bishop of Crediton, Rt. Reverend Nick McKinnel, added: 'This is terribly sad news and my heart goes out to the family of this young boy and to his friends at school.' Terry Keen, who lives next-door to the Crocker family, also paid tribute. He said: 'They are a wonderful, local family who have lived here for some time. He was a terrific young boy. 'We would often see him playing out the back, practising his basketball. He was getting very good at it. 'He went to Landscore School with his older brother. We do not know much about what happened.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the coroner had been informed of the death. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "A Turkish man accused of helping ISIS militants smuggle jihadis into Syria has also been charged with forcing Syrian refugee children into joining his paedophile prostitution ring, it has been claimed. Turkish investigators examining the links between\u00a0Ahmet Yumu\u015fak and the terror group are said to have discovered the 29-year-old talking with potential clients about the price of sex with refugees. He allegedly recommended certain women to his 'customers', who were inquiring about paying for sex with young females fleeing the Syrian warzone for what they had believed to be the safety of\u00a0Yumu\u015fak's native Hatay region of southern Turkey. Sick: Ahmet Yumu\u015fak was originally accused of helping would-be jihadis reach ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured). The investigation led to additional charges of him also running a prostitution ring in Turkey . Location: The young girls forced into prostituon had fled Syrian warzones for what they had believed to be the safety of Ahmet Yumu\u015fak's native Hatay region in southern Turkey . Yumu\u015fak's alleged crimes came to light after local detectives launched an investigation into an attack by Islamic State militants on police officers in the Turkish town of\u00a0Ni\u011fde in March last year. 11 people, including Yumu\u015fak, have already been charged in connection with that attack, according to Turkish newspaper\u00a0H\u00fcrriyet. Investigating officers using wiretaps to investigate the case are said to have caught Yumu\u015fak arranging for vulnerable Syrian refugee women to have sex with 'customers', even going as far as to make personal recommendations, saying: 'the 16-year-old one is terrific'. The alleged people smuggler has since been charged with forcing underage girls into prostitution. Another suspect in the case, named as Ayhan Orli, is accused of using his contacts in Hatay to procure\u00a050 kg of aluminium powder, which can be used to make explosives. According to the charge, a local police officer then cooperated with Orli to smuggle the powder over the border into Syria, where it was handed over to members of the militant group Ahrar ash-Sham. Terror group: Currently the majority of would-be jihadis travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers help them make the short journey to ISIS' Syrian stronghold Raqqa (pictured) NATO member state Turkey has long been accused of not doing enough to stem the flow of Western would-be jihadis arriving in the south of the country. Currently the majority travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers  help them make the short journey into Syria, where they are met by militants in ISIS-held Tell Abiad. From Tell Abiad the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa is just a 60 mile journey along Highway 6. Last month three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green are believed to made that exact journey, having first arrived in Turkey on a direct flight from London to Istanbul. Scotland Yard was facing questions over how the girls \u2013\u00a0Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and a 15-year-old German girl - were able to board a flight to Turkey unchallenged, despite having no parent or guardian with them. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay. Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim. With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death. Barbarians: Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay . Horror: The blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death . The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder. The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War. So many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass along the streets, although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line, giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery. The blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder. The next image shows the man plunging to his death, falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below.

        "article": "Andrea Barzagli has rejected recent criticism aimed at Italy coach Antonio Conte for including two foreign-born players in his squad to face Bulgaria and England. The Juventus centre-back defended his manager, who has come under fire from Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini among others for his choice to select Eder and Franco Vazquez, who are both Brazilian-born and Argentinian-born respectively. Speaking in a press conference ahead of Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria, Barzagli was keen to welcome the duo to the squad. Italy defender Andrea Barzagli has responded to recent comments made against naming foreign-born players . Italy boss Antonio Conte came under fire from Roberto Mancini for naming Eder and\u00a0Franco Vasquez . Brazilian-born Eder of Sampdoria gained Italian citizenship through some distance relatives of his . Franco Vasquez of Palermo is eligible to play for the national side because his mother was born in Italy . 'There have always been oriundi,' Barzagli said, using the Italian word for foreign-born players. 'There are rules, if they can be called up it's right that they have been because that means they are doing well in the league. 'I don't see why there should be debate, other nations have them, too. If they are good, if they can give us a hand, they're welcome in the national team.' The 33-year-old, who has 50 caps at senior level, admitted that in the face of criticism his international boss always puts the team first. Marco Verratti (right) joins in the action during a training session at Coverciano on Tuesday . Borussia Dortmund forward Ciro Immobile brings the ball under control during a passing drill . Paris Saint Germain goalkeeper\u00a0Salvatore Sirigu does his best to keep out a shot during shooting practice . 'Conte? He's very forthright, he says what he thinks and goes his own way. It's normal that he can create controversy if he knows that certain decisions will benefit the National Team.' However, with Euro 2016 likely to be the veteran defender's last major tournament for his country, Barzagli hopes that the likes of 20-year-old Sampdoria defender Alessio Romangoli can fill his shoes. 'I can't see myself still in Azzurro [the Italy squad] after the Euros, primarily because I'll be over 35. I'm not a player like [Gianluigi] Buffon or [Andrea] Pirlo who can keep going until 40. 'So I hope that young defenders like [Alessio] Romagnoli can take over for the National Team. There needs to be rejuvenation, definitely.' Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci concentrates on the ball as he works on his touch in training .",

        "article": "Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has urged Formula One's moaners to visit the Wailing Wall if they want their prayers answered on a change to the sport's regulations. Wolff was responding to the latest complaints from Red Bull team boss Christian Horner in the wake of Mercedes' crushing start to the 2015 season as Lewis Hamilton spearheaded a one-two in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Horner was left to reflect on 'a s***** Sunday' and the fear fans will turn off F1 after Mercedes' domination of the race at Melbourne's Albert Park . Nico Rosberg showers winner Lewis Hamilton after Mercedes finish on-two at Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton races to victory as Mercedes extend last season's dominance into the new campaign . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution . After winning the constructors' and drivers' titles for four years from 2010-2013, with Sebastian Vettel at the helm, Mercedes have taken up the mantle of F1 powerhouse. Having won 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors' crown, and with Hamilton clinching his second championship, the start to the new year was a breeze for Mercedes. Hamilton beat team-mate Nico Rosberg by 1.3secs, with Vettel third on his debut for Ferrari but 34.5secs off the pace. Predicting 'a two-horse race at every grand prix this year', Horner has called on the FIA to act to prevent an F1 yawn, and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given Red Bull's success. 'When we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - I remember double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was prohibited, engine mapping mid-season was changed,' said Horner of the steps taken to negate his team's performance. Red Bull's Christian Horner has complained about Mercedes, despite his team winning four consecutive titles . Horner claim that leaving Hamilton and Rosberg to fight it out for the title is unhealthy for the sport . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . 'Anything was done and that wasn't just unique to Red Bull, but Williams in previous years and McLaren, etcetera. 'Is it healthy to have this situation? The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at. 'Mercedes, take nothing away from them, they have done a great job and they have a good car, a fantastic engine, and two very good drivers. 'The problem is the gap is so big you end up with three-tier racing and that's not healthy for Formula One. 'The FIA have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise I fear the interest will wane. 'I didn't see Mercedes much on the TV and I can only imagine that's because it's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race.' Referring to the fact Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony, Horner added: 'The highlight for me was to see Arnie on the podium!' Hollywood star\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger interviews Hamilton after his winning start to the season . Responding to the call for equalisation, Wolff said: 'If you come into Formula One, try to beat each other and perform at the highest level and then you need equalisation after the first race - you cry out after the first race - that's not how we've done things in the past. 'I think 'Just get your f****** head down, work hard and try to sort it out'.' Quickly clarifying his remark, Wolff added: 'I didn't mean the f-word in relation to him (Horner).' Asked whether he feared another political season, Wolff replied: 'It is always a political season. It was last year and it is this year. 'There is this wall in Jerusalem that you can stand in front of and complain. Maybe the guys should go there.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067 . 2.

Sir Jeremy Heywood was given a humiliating rebuke by MPs yesterday for clearing taxpayer-funded advisers to take part in political campaigning. Westminster\u2019s Public Administration Committee said the country\u2019s top mandarin had been \u2018wrong in law\u2019 during a row over two of Theresa May\u2019s Special Advisers. It is another blow to the reputation of the Cabinet Secretary \u2013 who is known as Sir Cover Up for trying to block the publication of letters related to the Iraq War. Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson, two of the Home Secretary\u2019s closest aides, refused an order from Tory HQ to take part in telephone canvassing during last year\u2019s Rochester by-election. The pair said it was a breach of the special adviser's code, which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so. Number Ten and Tory HQ disagreed \u2013 suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming General Election as a punishment. To justify the decision, Number Ten relied upon advice from Sir Jeremy, who wields enormous power inside Government. He controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in \u2018backroom support\u2019 activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category. But that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee. The committee said: \u2018Any direction to a Special Adviser to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided, and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their Code and contract of employment was wrong in law. \u2018We recommend that Special Advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the Code and of their contracts of employment.\u2019 The Speaker\u2019s Counsel, Michael Carpenter, told MPs he had been \u2018unpersuaded\u2019 by Sir Jeremy\u2019s arguments. Mr Carpenter said that, far from being a backroom activity, telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public. Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election. Sources said they appeared to have a \u2018slam dunk case\u2019 to get their suspension lifted. Labour deputy chairman Jon Ashworth said: \u2018The Parliamentary Authorities have delivered a damning assessment of the Number 10 operation, and we now need to know which Ministers were complicit in issuing this \u2018misguided\u2019 advice. Sir Jeremy\u00a0controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in \u2018backroom support\u2019 activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category. Pictured: Theresa May . \u2018Given the proximity of the election campaign, we need a formal government response today which outlines how Number 10 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by Special Advisers.\u2019 At the time, the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long-running feud between Downing Street and the Home Office. Tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over Mrs May\u2019s own leadership ambitions. Polls have shown she is the activists\u2019 favourite to succeed the Prime Minister. Another of the Home Secretary\u2019s advisers, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit last summer after clashing with Michael Gove over extremism in schools. Last week, Sir Jeremy came under fire over new rules which ban the country\u2019s 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval. He approved the order at the request of Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude. Yesterday, the Mail told how the move was opposed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: \u2018Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\u2019",

Never one to miss a media opportunity, Trump, the owner of the Blue Monster course in Florida, got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3-iron club which world No. 1 McIlroy had thought he had seen the last of during Friday's second round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf's rules. \"He's never one to miss an opportunity,\" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. \"It was fine. It was good fun.\" Not that opportunity knocked for McIlroy when he chose the 3-iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again. The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. \"We're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,\" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy's main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with \"personal problems\" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long-time leader JB Holmes and two clear of Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion. Johnson celebrated on the 18th with his fiancee Paulina Gretzky, the daughter of ice hockey legend Wayne, and their newly-born son.",

Busch was accused by Patricia Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at Dover International Speedway in September. \"After a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case, it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Busch committed a crime during the September 26th incident,\" Delaware Department of Justice public information officer Carl Kanefsky said in a statement. \"Likelihood of meeting that high burden of proof is the standard for prosecutors in bringing a case. For this reason, the Department of Justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case.\" In a statement Thursday, Busch said he is grateful that the prosecutors decided not to file charges. \"I wish to thank my family, friends, fans, and race team who stood by me throughout this nightmare with their unwavering support,\" Busch said. \"Thanks also goes to my legal team for making sure that the truth got out and was fully provided to the prosecutors.  As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse. I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" While Busch will not be charged, he must stay away from Driscoll for one year, a Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February. Driscoll had requested a no-contact order against Busch. Stemming from the family court ruling, NASCAR suspended Busch indefinitely shortly before the Daytona 500. That decision was upheld after appeal. CNN has reached out to NASCAR for an update on Busch's status but did not immediately hear back. \"Patricia and I are very disappointed that Kurt will not be prosecuted for the abusive acts he committed in September,\" Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, said Thursday. \"The (attorney general's) decision, however, only makes the order that we received for protection from abuse that much more important. \"As you can see, in some cases, this is the only protection the victim will get. This civil no contact order is a critical tool for protecting victims.\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear Busch's name. At the no-contact hearing, Busch testified that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin for the U.S. government and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood. Driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons. McNeice has said that her client denies Busch's allegations.",

Kimberly Kitchen, 45, of James Creek, Pennsylvania, was charged on Thursday with forgery and unauthorized practice of law. State prosecutors contend Kitchen fooled BMZ Law in Huntingdon by forging a law license, bar exam results, an email showing she attended Duquesne University law school and a check for a state attorney registration fee. Kimberly Kitchen, 45, allegedly fooled BMZ Law (pictured) in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, by\u00a0forging a law license, bar exam results, an email showing she attended Duquesne University law school and a check for a state attorney registration fee . Kitchen handled estate planning for more than 30 clients 'despite never having attended law school, nor being admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,' the attorney general said in a statement. Kitchen was, however, the past president of the Huntingdon County Bar Association, said her attorney, Caroline Roberto. 'She's an incredibly competent person and she worked very diligently and was devoted to the people she served in the community,' Roberto said. 'There are things about the charges we don't agree with so we're going to be fighting some of the charges,' Roberto said, though she wouldn't be specific. But Christopher Wencker, the current president of the county bar association, said he doesn't think the charges are severe enough. 'For a decade of that kind of behavior, those kind of charges are insufficient and don't represent the depth or level of betrayal that was shown,' Wencker said. The forgery charge is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison; the unauthorized practice charge is a third-degree misdemeanor, carrying up to a year in jail. Kitchen was charged on Thursday with forgery and unauthorized practice of law after pretending to be a lawyer for a decade (file photo) Wencker said the county bar plans to meet Tuesday to formulate a statement on behalf of the group. A representative of the law firm didn't immediately return a call seeing comment Friday. But in December, when the Huntingdon Daily News first reported on the case, the firm issued a statement saying they would be going through all her cases. 'Sadly, it would appear that our firm was the last, in a long line of professionals, to have been deceived by Ms. Kitchen into believing she was licensed to practice law,' the statement said. 'We are undertaking a thorough review of each and every file she may have handled.' It wasn't immediately clear where else Kitchen might have worked. Roberto wouldn't comment on whether any clients were harmed or complained about the services Kitchen rendered, except to repeat that Kitchen was 'incredibly competent'. She said Kitchen, who is married with no children, is no longer working anywhere. 'Since December, when she was asked not to practice again, she's just been waiting for this to be resolved,' Roberto said.",

        "article": "There are fears inside Zimbabwe's that president Robert Mugabe wants to turn his dictatorial rule over the country into a monarchy - by getting his daughter to succeed him. He originally planned for his wife to assume the position of president after him but her worsening health has forced Mugabe to turn to his 24-year-old daughter Bona, according to the Times. She accompanied the 91-year-old dictator on a recent trip to Japan to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - a move which drew widespread condemnation from parties within the country. Last year, Mugabe promoted his wife Grace to a senior position within his ruling ZANU-PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice-president Joice Mujuru from office. Scroll down for video . 'Dynasty': There are fears inside Zimbabwe that 91-year-old president Robert Mugabe (centre) wants his daughter Bona (left) to succeed him . But the 49-year-old has fallen severely ill in recent months and she has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. In her absence, their daughter Bona has taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president's side at official events and trips. Earlier this week, photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan's prime minister. The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU-PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated. In an interview with Nehanda Radio,\u00a0Psychology Mazivisa said:\u00a0'Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much. 'We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it's President Mugabe doing it, no matter how perfectly lawful it is, it's wrong... It's a barbaric way of doing politics.' But a spokesman for the opposition MDC party said it clearly showed 'that the state has been virtually privatised by the Mugabe dynasty'. Bona Mugabe-Chikore was born to Robert Mugabe's first wife Sally and attended the Dominican Convent School in Harare. Succession: Mugabe originally wanted his wife Grace (centre) to assume the position of president after him, but her worsening health has forced him to turn to his daughter Bona (right) An Irish nun who reportedly taught her there said: 'I never had a moment's trouble with the girl.' She enrolled at City University in Hong Kong under an alias and in 2011, she graduated with an honours degree in accountancy and administration. She gained a master's degree in banking and finance at the Management Development Institute in Zimbabwe two years later. And just last year, she married an Emirates airline pilot Simba Chikore in a luxurious wedding ceremony in Zimbabwe. Her inclusion in the diplomatic mission to Tokyo also sparked widespread condemnation because many civil servants in the country have worked for months without pay. Mugabe recently said he earned \u00a38,000 a month compared to the average civil servant's salary of \u00a3200 but claimed: 'I am suffering just like you.'",

When Sadio Mane fired home eight minutes from time, not only did it end a run of three games without a win - it ended a 387 minute spell without a home league goal. This wasn't a display that said much for Southampton's Champions League credentials, nevertheless their top-four dream is still alive after this scrappy win over Crystal Palace. Sadio Mane races away to celebrate following his 83rd minute strike at St Mary's . Mane watches on as his strike secured a much-needed three points for Ronald Koeman's side . Southampton (4-2-3-1):\u00a0Forster 6.5; Clyne 6.5, Fonte 6.5, Yoshida 6, Bertrand 6.5; Wanyama 6.5, Schneiderlin 6.5; Elia 6 (Tadic 59), Djuricic 6 (Ward-Prowse 78), Mane 6.5; Pelle 5.5 (Long 70).

Subs not sued:\u00a0Mariappa, Hangeland, Hennessey, Ameobi, Boateng, Gray, Souare. Manager: Alan Pardew 6 . Booked:\u00a0Delaney, McArthur . Referee:\u00a0Martin Atkinson (West Yorkshire) 6.5 . Attendance: 28,351 . Click here to check out our brilliant\u00a0Match Zone for pitch maps, heat maps and all the stats from Southampton's late victory. 'We scored and we won at home, so I'm relieved, but I can't say we deserved to win,' said Koeman. 'It's all about confidence and we didn't have that tonight. But I think it can one of the key moments in our season. 'Qualifying for the Champions League will be difficult, but we will try our best.' Palace manager Alan Pardew wasn't as contented in his post-match press conference, however. The Eagles boss was angered by referee Martin Atkinson's decision not to award the his side a second half penalty after Jose Fonte bundled over Yannick Bolasie in the 70th minute. 'Fonte was over aggressive in the box,' insisted Pardew. 'It should have been given, but we've been harshly treated by officials in the last few games and sometimes you get a run like that.' In response to Pardew's comments, Koeman said: 'It's easy to tell that story after losing game, the ref wasn't involved in final result. 'We scored, they didn't. I know that feeling, it's too easy and people talk too much about referees. I don't like that.' Pardew may change his mind once he sees replays of Fonte's shoulder-to-shoulder collision with Bolasie. Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha (right) controls posession under pressure from Southampton defender Maya Yoshida . Eagles forward Zaha makes a run as Saints midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) gives chase at St Mary's Stadium . Perhaps the Palace manager, who was without skipper Mile Jedinak, who on Tuesday accepted a four match suspension for elbowing Diafra Sakho on Saturday, was trying to mask his disappointment at leaving the south coast with nothing when they could easily have left with all three points. The fact Palace players hardly appealed for a spot-kick tells its own story. Southampton enjoyed the upper hand during the opening exchanges, Filip Djurcic fashioning the first chance, controlling Victor Wanyama's mishit shot only to fire over the bar in the 11th minute. But despite their dominance in terms of possession, this looked a Southampton side void of invention in the final third. Even 25 minutes into the game, you could sense the anxiety from home supporters. Earlier this week a local newspaper scrapped an idea to print full-page arrows for Saints fans to display  as a tongue-in-cheek reminder to players of where the opposition goal is. Crystal Palace's\u00a0Yannick Bolasie takes a tumble following the twin challenge of Nathaniel Clyne (left) and Victor Wanyama . Mane is upended by the challenge of Crystal Palace midfielder Joe Ledley . Graziano Pelle (left) and Scott Dann both hit the turf as the Italian chases his first goal looked to add to his single goal in 13 appearances . But on the evidence of the opening 45 minutes, Koeman's side needed all the help they could get. The anxiety in Southampton's attacking play even trickled back to their usually tight defence in the 36th minute, goalkeeper Fraser Forster misjudging a high ball, nearly allowing Wilfried Zaha to tap into an empty net. Palace keeper Julian Speroni made the first real stop of the night in the 40th minute, saving Eljero Elia's shot from a half-cleared Morgan Schneiderlin corner at his near post.

Southampton striker Pelle blows a great chance to break the deadlock as he shoots wide from close range . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman (right) watches on from the technical area with Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew not far away . The rebound fell to Pelle, but the struggling striker could only stab his effort wide from close range. During the opening months of the season, the ball would have nestled in the back of the net for the Italian. How he must long for those heady days. So to must have Koeman as he faced up to yet another half-time team talk without a goal from his side. Likewise, Palace offered next to nothing in the attacking third during the opening 45 minutes, nevertheless Pardew would have been satisfied with the outcome of their first half. He'd have been even happier if Forster hadn't produced an excellent save from Jason Puncheon in the 48th minute after the former Saints forward turned Maya Yoshida brilliantly in the box. Seven minutes later the visitors went even closer, Zaha hitting the inside of Forster's far post after the England goalkeeper's initial save from Bolasie. Koeman replaced Elia with Dusan Tadic just before the hour mark in search of attacking impetus, Shane Long and Shane Ward-Prowse soon followed. Saints boss Koeman was fearing another goalless 90 minutes from his side in the 69th minute when Maya Yoshida somehow fired wide from three yards after Schneiderlin's corner. But eight minutes from time, St Mary's erupted as Mane fired home after Speroni failed to hold from Ward-Prowse's shot.

The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was yesterday arrested for helping the trio cross the border. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, can be heard talking to an Arabic interpreter about  fake Syrian passports while laden with bags. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. From there, they reportedly take a taxi to an arranged meeting point where they are greeted by the spy, named by Turkish media as Muhammed Al Rashad. Scroll down for videos . On the run: New footage has emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . Caught on camera: The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Runaways: Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are understood to have since reached the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK to join a friend last month . Footage shows him instructing them to take their baggage and not leave anything behind and says they will be in Syria within the hour. Al Rashad can be heard saying 'Come on sisters ... Don't forget anything. You will be there in an hour insh'Allah,' before the girls' luggage is unloaded from the taxi and the trio are helped into a silver minivan. He speaks both English and Arabic in the four minute-long video and his face is visible at several points. Al Rashad then allegedly delivered the girls to ISIS and returns to Turkey, where he is arrested, according to Daily Sabah. Separate footage released by Daily Sabah appears to show Al Rashad being taken into custody in Sanliurfa near the Syrian border. One report said he was a Syrian who was working for the Canadian intelligence service. Another said that he was a dentist. Turkish news agency Dogan said Rashad has been held in solitary confinement in a prison in Sanliurfa province since being caught. Citing his testimony to police, it said he had identified fighters he helped enter Syria to an official at Canada's embassy in Jordan. 'I have no intention of spying. My aim is to prevent terrorist activity,' Dogan quoted him as saying. Rashad also allegedly told the agency he had accompanied at least 25 foreign fighters so far to Gaziantep. He said: 'Border commanders within Islamic State instructed me where to drop these people. I drove them to Gaziantep city centre in a cab and handed them over to others. 'I don't know how and from where they took them to Syria.' Evidence: The secret camera shows an alleged spy working for the Canadian intelligence agency helping the girls with their bags and arranging their fake Syrian passports . Suspect: Separate footage claims to show the Canadian intelligence agent being led to the courthouse by plain-clothed police officers after he was arrested on suspicion of helping the cross into Syria . The film featuring the three girls was confiscated after his arrest. Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Cavusoglu yesterday said the suspect worked for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS. But he did not identify the country, saying only that it was not the United States or a member of the European Union. Canada's Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness said: 'We are aware of these reports. 'We do not comment on operational matters of national security.' The footage shows the girls walking with another man who is suspected of helping them cross into Syria . Mr Cavusoglu, who was interviewed on Turkish channel A Haber TV, said he had shared the information with his British counterpart - Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he had no information. The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. It emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. A man has been arrested for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 (above) - cross into Syria to become Jihadi brides for Islamic State militants . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes . Police discovered they paid the \u00a31,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year. The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas. On the run: (l to r) Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and\u00a0Kadiza Sultana\u00a0paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State's stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities. Sought advice: Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year . It is thought they were staying with a British girl \u2013 believed to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined ISIS. The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK. 'We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,' he said. Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls' families \u2013 explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend's disappearance \u2013 had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this week. Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. He accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) in Raqqa has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Evidence: Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week . The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to the fourth girl's disappearance. However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.' At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. The U.S.-led coalition is using mostly air power in an attempt to push the Sunni militant group back.",

        "article": "Britain's Big Six energy firms are set to make \u00a3118 per household despite\u00a0falling wholesale gas and electricity prices . The average profit that energy firms are making from customers has surged to an all-time high of \u00a3118 a household. This is up by a third on last year and well over double the \u00a349 the companies were making two years ago. The rise is a direct result of firms failing to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale price they pay for gas and electricity. The industry regulator Ofgem estimates that the average wholesale cost of gas and electricity is down from \u00a3633 per household a year ago to \u00a3553 \u2013 an \u00a380 drop. But its figures for household dual-fuel bills show a lower fall of \u00a360, taking them to an average of \u00a31,295 a year \u2013 of which nearly 10 per cent is profit. The Big Six firms \u2013 British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power \u2013 have been able to cash in by keeping their tariffs high during winter. They have announced small reductions of around 5 per cent or less, but this will make little difference to household bills. The apparent profiteering comes despite the fact that last year was one of the warmest on record and total household consumption of gas and electricity was down by 14 per cent on 2013. It will add to demands for a shake-up amid claims that suppliers are failing to compete on price and customer service. The Competition and Markets Authority is asking suppliers to explain why lower wholesale costs have not been passed on and Which? wants a new regime for setting energy prices. The consumer group suggests regulators should set a fair \u2018price to beat\u2019 based on an assessment of costs, and firms would compete to match or undercut it. A charting showing the decreasing wholesale energy costs and the increasing pre-tax margin for the energy giants . Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: \u2018Consumers will be questioning why their bills haven\u2019t been slashed further at a time of rising profits and falling wholesale prices. Energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern, so we need the CMA to get to the bottom of whether the price people pay is right. We also need to see simple pricing, and a price to beat that people can trust.\u2019 Citizens Advice said: \u2018Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits while barely cutting energy prices.\u2019 Energy companies reject the way Ofgem estimates profits. Lawrence Slade, of the trade body Energy UK, said: \u2018Ofgem risks misleading customers by publishing these inaccurate figures every month.\u2019 The firms have suggested part of the blame for high bills should fall on Ed Miliband and his vow to impose a price freeze if Labour wins the election. Executives suggest they are unwilling to cut prices because they are afraid of being locked into low tariffs that would put their profits at risk. Wholesale gas and electricity costs are expected to be \u00a380 less than they were estimated at a year ago .",

The former Liverpool man scored the winning goal early in the second half, as the Catalonian side extended their lead at the top of La Liga to four points but his team-mate came under-fire after choosing to shoot instead of pass the ball when in a good positions. But Suarez has defended Neymar and believes he was doing what he supposed to do as an attacker and reckons the talented attacker will win the most prestigious award a footballer can in the future. Luis Suarez has backed his Barcelona team-mate Neymar after the forward was criticised for being 'selfish' Neymar (centre) was defended by the Uruguayan who thinks he was right to play how he did as a forward . The Uruguayan told RAC1: 'He was right to try and finish his chances and not pass. Strikers are selfish. 'He is a key player and I'm convinced that he will win the Ballon d'Or.' Suarez was Barcelona's hero at full time after his brilliant control was matched with an equally impressive finish following Dani Alves' pinpoint pass. The Brazilian had a number of opportunities to release the ball in a good position but chose to go for goal . But the \u00a375million man, was less than impressed with his overall performance. 'The goal obviously has added significance because of who we were playing and in terms of La Liga,' he said. 'At the end of the match I made some amateurish mistakes but that was because I was tired. Luckily nothing happened.' Suarez slots home the winner after brilliantly controlling Dani Alves' long ball over the top of the defence . Barcelona were drawn against Chelsea's conquerors in the quarter finals of the Champions League after dispatching of Manchester City and ending England's hopes of having a team progress into the last eight. But Suarez knows that his side have to beat the top teams if they want to be the best in Europe. 'We are aware that to win the Champions have to beat the best teams, starting with PSG,' he added. Suarez knows his side will be in for a tough task against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League .",

He has been very impressive since I have been here and his confidence is high. He hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that Glenn Hoddle would have been proud of. \u2018He has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does. \u2018I don\u2019t think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad. He is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see. What will be, will be, but his best years are still in front of him.\u2019 For Pardew personally, he would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad. Wilfried Zaha was the last Palace player to be called up to the England squad back in 2012 and Pardew says his players must find their place in the Premier League first. Dann is 28 but Pardew says he has his best years ahead of him and has been impressed by his character . Charlie Austin, who was also left out of the England squad, loses out in an aerial challenge to Dann . Wilfried Zaha was the last Palace player to be called up for England in 2012 in his previous spell at the club . Pardew would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad during his time as manager . Harry Kane\u2019s rapid assent into Hodgson\u2019s squad is something that Pardew admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality. He added: \u2018There have not been too many Palace players in the England squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad. Sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year, you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level. Harry Kane has won a place in the England squad and Pardew has been impressed with his quick progress . \u2018Our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that. \u2018To be fair to Harry Kane he has done that in a very quick time at a top club, and that is difficult to do, so hats off to him. \u2018Lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country.\u2019",

The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error. Surprisingly for the men who met each other for the first time in court, both Mr Fields and the spend thrift reside in the same town of Hull, lived within half a mile of each other for a period of time and bank at First Citizens Bank, according to CBS 46. A Georgia teen (18-year-old Steven Fields above) who splurged on a BMW using $31,000 mistakenly deposited into his account has been sentenced to ten years on probation and has to pay the money back . The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, (elder Fields pictured above) who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error . In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant, according to KHQ. Following his sentencing, he has reportedly been arrested for illegal drug possession. In the March 2014 bank error, the teenager was charged with felony theft after spending the money. When he first received the funds, he first withdrew  $20,000 in cash before spending another $5,000. On March 18, when he returned to the bank take out more cash, he was asked to return the money mistakenly placed into his account, according to\u00a0Athens Banner-Herald. While Mr Fields and the recipient of the money had a lot in common, they never knew of each other. In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant.\u00a0Following his sentencing, he has reportedly since been arrested for illegal drug possession . Surprisingly for the men who met each other for the first time in court, both Mr Fields and the spend thrift reside in the same town of Hull, lived within half a mile of each other for a period of time and bank at First Citizens Bank (above) Following the incident, the rightful owner of the money has reportedly had it returned to him by the bank. However, he said more than anything, he is upset the teller, who has not been named and made the transaction, has been forced to retire following her error. He said: 'That's the only thing that upset me was that my friend lost her job.' Last March, a woman, Stacey Sorrow, who raised the younger Fields said the teller should have corrected her mistake if she was aware there were people with the same name. She said of the moment the teen received the money: 'He was excited. I would have been too.' The teen and his father have both apologized to the veteran, who said he does not know if younger Fields is sincere, or just sorry that he got caught.",

Normally one of the hottest tourist tickets in town, the home of Michelangelo's celebrated ceiling frescoes closed its doors early to regular visitors to enable the group of around 150 street-sleepers to be shown around the chapel and adjoining Vatican museums and gardens. In an unannounced visit, it was the pope himself who welcomed the group to the Sistine Chapel, taking the time to greet each of the visitors. Special guests: 150 homeless people pose for photographs in the Sistine Chapel yesterday in Pope Francis'\u00a0latest gesture towards the most vulnerable people in society . Honour: A nun leads 150 homeless people through the Sistine Chapel on their private guided tour . Eating: After the private guide tour of the\u00a0Sistine Chapel, the homeless people were treated to a dinner . Private: In an unannounced visit, it was the pope himself who welcomed the group to the Sistine Chapel, taking the time to greet each of the visitors. He requested that no pictures were taken of him doing so . 'This is a house for everyone, this is your home. The doors are always open to all,' the Argentinian pope told them. 'Pray for me, I need the prayers of people like you,' he added. The pontiff had asked that there be no pictures of the meeting. It was the latest in a string of highly symbolic initiatives sanctioned by Francis, who has made a focus on the plight of the homeless and other marginalised groups one of the defining themes of his papacy. Last month a homeless man who died on the streets around St Peter's Square was buried in an exclusive cemetery within the Vatican that is usually reserved for senior German clerics. The pope, who says he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor,' has also had showers for the homeless installed in public toilets just off St Peter's square. On their way: 150 homeless people are seen arriving at the Sistine Chapel for their guided tour and free dinner. Pope Francis himself made a surprise appearance at the event, greeting each guest individually . The guided tour is the latest in a string of highly symbolic initiatives sanctioned by Francis, who has made a focus on the plight of the homeless and other marginalised groups one of the defining themes of his papacy . Not a publicity stunt: Pope Francis requested that no photographs were taken of him taking the time to meet and greet all 150 of the homeless people as he didn't want  the gesture to be used for publicity . Gesture: Last month a homeless man who died on the streets around St Peter's Square was buried in an exclusive cemetery within the Vatican that is usually reserved for senior German clerics . Giving: The pope, who says he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor,' has also had showers for the homeless installed in public toilets just off St Peter's square. The families of hostages David Haines and Alan Henning who were murdered by the Islamic extremist Jihadi John have been blessed by the Pope. Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. On Wednesday, Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope\u00a0on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates. Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. To mark his 78th birthday in December, Pope Francis ordered the distribution of sleeping bags across Rome and some homeless people have been recruited to hand out copies of the gospels to the faithful attending Sunday audiences at St Peter's. This morning it emerged that Francis will become the first pontiff to address the US Congress after accepting an invitation to visit the White House. US President Barack Obama will host the Pope on September 23, after extending an invitation during talks at the Vatican last year. The White House said the president and the pope will continue a dialogue about poverty, the environment, immigration and promoting religious freedom. 'The president looks forward to continuing this conversation with the Holy Father during his first visit to the United States as pope,' a statement said.",

Pulis welcomes his former club to the Black Country on Saturday hoping to break Stoke's 100 per cent winning record at The Hawthorns. While the Baggies head into the match on the back of two frustrating defeats to local rivals Aston Villa in league and cup action, Stoke are looking for a fourth successive win and sit eighth in the Barclays Premier League. Tony Pulis admits he takes pride in seeing Stoke's success in the Premier League this season . While Pulis stopped short of claiming the credit for Stoke's current success, the Welshman was happy to point out his influence in their squad. 'The great thing for me about the club is that you leave it in a condition where it can grow and grow and get better,' he said. 'Look at the players who are there, the backbone of that football club, like Glenn Whelan, Ryan Shawcross, Asmir Begovic, Steven N'Nonzi, Peter Crouch, Jon Walters, just a few to mention. 'Marc Wilson, Geoff Cameron, wonderful people and wonderful professionals, and it's really nice when you take over a club with all good professionals like that.' He added: 'How many players has Mark brought in? 'I don't know but the majority of the lads who were there before still seem to be picked week-in week-out, that's testament to them as individuals to win over a new manager. Pulis takes credit for the 'backbone' of the Stoke side, which includes Ryan Shawcross (above) 'Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross are the only ones who were there when we got promoted from the Championship. 'They've been brilliant. And they've been brilliant for the football club.' Albion have doubts over strikers Saido Berahino, Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe for the clash. Berahino and Ideye have been playing through the pain barrier recently while Anichebe has a groin problem. Winger Callum McManaman has a foot injury which boss Tony Pulis has decided to rest for a few weeks. Saido Berahino (centre) is a doubt for West Brom's Premier League clash against Stoke .",

        "article": "Flip-flops? Check. Sunglasses? Check. Twenty-four degree heat? Check. Now all I need is a fruity cocktail and I could be in Mauritius. Except I\u2019m not on holiday. I\u2019m in a basement in central London, moments from the frenzy of Oxford Street. Outside, it\u2019s a typical day \u2014 cold and damp, with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots. It\u2019s estimated that two million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected . Down here, amid the lemon trees and pink, plastic bougainvillea, it\u2019s so tropical that I half expect Barry Manilow to cha-cha-cha past singing the Copacabana. Welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in Britain. This is a \u2018Real Sunlight\u2019 clinic, where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth. But you don\u2019t have to face the airport, and it won\u2019t cost you thousands of pounds. At the flick of a switch, you can flit between Mauritius, Miami and Bali \u2014 or, at least, their sunshine equivalents. Dr Daya (pictured) originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winter . As holidays go, it\u2019s pretty convenient: no passport, no packing and the weather is guaranteed. It\u2019s estimated that 2 million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), caused by a lack of sunlight, with up to three times more women than men affected. Symptoms include low-level depression, lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life. The syndrome is so widespread, the NHS has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it \u2014 which includes artificial sun. In the past, if you were down in the dumps during winter, the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot. But what if you can\u2019t afford to? What if you\u2019re trapped on this cold, damp isle until the spring, whenever that may be? It was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to Goa, in India, for a fortnight that I thought, hang on, I need some sunshine, too! Which is how I found myself slipping on my flip-flops at Dr Daya\u2019s Wholistic Medical Centre on that Monday afternoon. Dr Daya is the sort of GP you find a lot of around Harley Street. A private practitioner, she\u2019s open to alternative medicine, \u2018taking a holistic approach, looking at the whole body and lifestyle, not just one part of it\u2019. Prince Charles would approve. Hers is the only clinic in Britain to offer a \u2018real sunshine\u2019 room to the public. It opened in 2009, though she has just moved premises and spruced it up. It\u2019s a normal-sized sitting room, done up to feel like a tropical holiday. The walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass, jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens, soothing music plays in the background. In a corner, above your head, beams the \u2018artificial sun\u2019. It looks like a row of wall-mounted security lights \u2014 three square boxes, the sort you might get at a football stadium. Dr Daya's Wholistic Medical Centre (pictured) in central London where you can experience the Miami sun . The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box \u2014 which beams out an assimilation of natural light \u2014 for \u00a350. \u2018Light boxes do work,\u2019 says Dr Daya, \u2018but this is out of this world. This is the full spectrum \u2014 infra-red, UVA, UVB and you get the heat, whereas with SAD boxes, you just get visible light.\u2019 The inventor of the equipment, Ingemar Nilsson, stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997. Commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for Swedish car manufacturer Saab to test the effects of the sun\u2019s rays on different paints, he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks. He realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he\u2019d created. So he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use, and ten years later had created the technology he sells now. Initially, the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes. The first private sunlight room was created in Sweden, and there have now been 150 installations worldwide. In Britain, 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals. \u2018Some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms,\u2019 says Karl Emanuelsson, the UK company representative. \u2018People put sand on the floor, surround sound systems to replicate the sea, the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience.\u2019 Dr Daya originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winters. \u2018I was born in Africa and I really need the sun,\u2019 she says. \u2018I don\u2019t think you need to have been born in Africa to feel you\u2019re missing the sun here, but that was my excuse. \u2018When I was 13, I was sent from Tanzania to boarding school here, and I still can\u2019t get over how long the winters are.\u2019 A woman looks at a ' light lounge' - a treatment aimed at Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers (SAD) Back in Tanzania, which lies on the Equator, there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year, out of a possible 4,383. In Britain, the average is typically less than half that, ranging from 1,364 per year in Birmingham to 1,888 in Eastbourne. Dr Daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics, and decided to buy one for herself. \u2018I thought it was a bit extravagant, and that I should really share it with other people, so I opened the sun room,\u2019 she says. She charges \u00a350 for a one-hour session, which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp \u2014 but, on the other hand, it\u2019s less than the cost of a holiday and, as soon as you flick the switch, you\u2019re hit in the face with that lovely, warm feeling, as if you\u2019ve just stepped off a plane in the Caribbean. There are three settings: an hour of \u2018Bali\u2019 is the mildest, equivalent to a long sunset, while \u2018Miami\u2019, Dr Daya\u2019s favourite, is 45 minutes of full whack, then 15 minutes of winding down. She finds \u2018Mauritius\u2019 is the most popular, as it\u2019s the strongest, so that\u2019s what I plump for. And, boy, do those lamps give off light. Not just light, but heat. In seconds, the room is toasty warm, and I\u2019m breaking into a sweat. You can wear what you like \u2014 Dr Daya likes to spend an hour here after work, in her underwear, catching up with reading. Some visit as couples, while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break. But what are the actual health benefits? We know we get a large part of our vitamin D intake \u2014 important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones \u2014 from the sun. Some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish. But from October to April, 90 per cent of the UK lies too far north to have enough UVB rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin D in the skin. So, if they\u2019re not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors, many are at risk of being vitamin D deficient. Which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket. But just a burst \u2014 and no more. There\u2019s a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room. \u2018The recommended dose is no more than one hour a day, which is completely safe,\u2019 says Dr Daya. \u2018But if you did three hours every day, we couldn\u2019t vouch for the effects. 'It\u2019s like anything \u2014 it\u2019s important not to overdo it.\u2019 Dr Daya claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day. And one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains, especially joints, and has a positive effect on his brain power \u2014 it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker. After leaving Dr Daya\u2019s clinic, I do feel more cheerful and friends say I have a rosy complexion, compared with my normal pasty, winter face. I ask Dr Daya if she still feels the need to go on holiday. \u2018Who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office?\u2019 she replies. Good point. Even so, I could still do with a week in Mauritius. The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box, which beams out an assimilation of natural light, like this one, the Lumie Zip for \u00a3150 .",

This is a federal government building.\u201d And that\u2019s when he wrote the note.\u2019 She said that the man then wrote down a message on a piece of paper saying: \u2018Call your congressman, who do not (sic) have to write down for you. It\u2019s not the law. Get an interpreter.\u2019 According to Wftv, she said: \u2018At that point, he started treating us like we were dogs, literally just motioning at us like we were dogs, like we needed to get out of here.\u2019 She woman that a supervisor then wrote down a message (pictured) on a piece of paper saying: \u2018Call your congressman, who do not (sic) have to write down for you.

        "article": "Top French chef Marc Veyrat has vowed 'I'll be back' after a fire tore through his Alpine restaurant. The fire broke out Tuesday at the celebrity chef's La Maison du Bois, a wooden chalet 6,000 feet up in the French Alps near the Swiss border,\u00a0causing substantial damage. Firefighters had extinguished the blaze inside the restaurant by mid-morning but were still battling to bring it under control as it ravaged the roof of the wooden structure. Inside the remains: Chef Marc Veyrat points to his fire-damaged\u00a0La Maison du Bois restaurant. Authorities believe the blaze started in the kitchen . Charred remains: The fire ripped through the roof of the Alpine restaurant after starting in the kitchen . Authorities said it appeared to have started in the kitchens and spread rapidly to the dining area, where several pieces of antique furniture were destroyed. Veyrat, considered by some to be the finest chef in the world with six Michelin stars to his name, said a piece of 'cultural history' had been destroyed. 'This is a life and a piece of French cultural history that has just gone up in flames,' he said. Blaze: Fire appliances at top chef Marc Veyrat's restaurant after a fire broke out in the Alpine restaurant on Tuesday . Emergency: Firefighters, their faces covered in soot, walk away from the snow-flanked Alpine restaurant . Snowy conditions: Firefighters shovel snow from a chalet roof to cool the flames at the Alpine restaurant . Gutted: Marc Veyrat looks devastated as he stands in what remains of La Maison du Bois following a fire in the French chalet restaurant . Damage: Michelin-starred chef Veyrat points to the fire-ravaged roof beams in the chalet restaurant in the Alps, where the fire took hold . 'It's not just a restaurant but also a museum of popular art showing several pieces of furniture from the region. It's sad, but I'm a fighter. I'll be back.' Known as much for roaming the countryside seeking wild herbs for his top-of-the-range dishes as for his trademark black hat, Veyrat has already suffered a forced break in his career. In 2009, he stopped work, saying he could no longer bear the physical strains of the kitchen after a serious ski accident. 6 Michelin stars: A meal prepared by the top chef at one of his other award-winning restaurants . High altitude: Firemen work on the heavily damaged roof, surrounded by snow in the French Alps . Recovery:\u00a0Veyrat opened La Maison Des Bois after taking a break from his culinary ventures following a skiing accident . He handed back the six Michelin stars he had won for two separate three-star restaurants and only  re-entered the kitchen in 2013, opening his Alpine restaurant. Veyrat specialises in traditional dishes, with lots of wild herbs and a little 'molecular gastronomy', chemistry-inspired recipes that produce new textures such as emulsions in cuisine. But such Michelin-starred genius does not come cheap. According to his website, the top 12-course tasting menu at La Maison du Bois would set the diner back \u00a3225.

        "article": "One of at least four airmen captured by Al Qaeda militants after their Syrian Air Force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric. The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province, is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle. Al-Muhaysini, who has long been affiliated with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria, suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the Syrian regime releases notorious jihadi\u00a0Abu Mus'ab as-Suri, who is wanted in Spain for suspected links to the 1985 El Descanso and 2004 Madrid bombings. Scroll down for video . Fear: The captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle . Threatened: The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday, appeared in the video released by Al Qaeda-linked militants from Jabhat al-Nusra this morning . The video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra behind him. Clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash, the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head. The footage is decidedly amateur, is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick, professionally edited videos put out by Nusra's rival jihadi group Islamic State. Nevertheless, the sight of Al-Muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any ISIS release. Al-Muhaysini's primary demand is that the Syrian regime release\u00a0Abu Mus'ab as-Suri - a notorious Al Qaeda linked militant who was arrested in Pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland. Aleppo-born As-Suri - who holds Spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in Spain on suspicion of taking part in the Islamic Jihad Organization's 1985 bombing at Madrid's El Descanso restaurant, which left 18 dead. He is also wanted as a possible witness to the Al Qaeda-inspired  coordinated\u00a0bombings on the Madrid's train system, which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in March 2004. 'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed in Jabal al-Zawiya yesterday . Gathered around: Islamist rebels captured four crew members when the helicopter crashed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . The airman was one of six people on board the Syrian Air Force helicopter when it crashed  in a rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday. It experienced a technical malfunction and made an emergency crash-landing according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syria's state news agency confirmed that a helicopter had crashed after a mechanical problem and said the authorities were looking for the crew. The SOHR stated that opposition fighters, including from the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, had taken four crew members prisoner. Another airman survived the crash but was reportedly killed by his captors, and the fate of a suspected sixth airman is unknown, the Observatory said. SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman said: \u2018A regime helicopter was forced to land in the region of Jabal al-Zawiya in the north-west,\u00a0which is a bastion of (Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate) Al-Nusra Front. \u2018Four of the crew were captured and a fifth man was killed by armed men in a neighbouring village.\u2019 Down: The airman was one of six people on board the Syrian Air Force helicopter when it crashed in a rebel-held area of north-western Syria, near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province yesterday. A girl flashes a victory sign as she poses near the crashed helicopter near Jabal al-Zawiya  yesterday . Pictures provided by the Observatory showed groups of men gathering around a damaged helicopter lying on its side on a rocky hilltop. Mr Rahman said two of the servicemen were being held by Nusra Front, while the other two were captured by an unknown Islamist group. An amateur video posted online showed rebels inspecting the wreckage of the helicopter, which had rolled on to its side on a rocky hill. The aircraft's blue undercarriage was partially torn and the nose badly damaged. Photographs posted by activists online showed the same crash site and at least two airmen in rebel custody. The United Nations claims the Syrian air force uses helicopters extensively to drop barrel bombs in indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. The improvised munitions are giant canisters packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and scrap metal. However, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied in a BBC interview last February that his forces used barrel bombs.",

Loretta Perminas had taken her two children and three grandchildren to visit her mother Jadvyga's grave in Carlton Cemetery in Nottingham on Mother's Day but found flowers and an ornament on the grave had been pushed aside to make way for a large pile of soil. Ms Perminas 54, said: 'It's just heartbreaking. We didn't even have anywhere to put the flowers.' Scroll down for video . Loretta Perminas took her family to visit the grave of her mother, only to find that it had been covered by a large pile of rubble and the flowers and ornaments she had placed on the plot had been pushed aside . The council has since apologised to the family and said they sometimes have to put soil on nearby graves when they dig a new plot. 'To cover up someone's grave with a pile of rubble is so disrespectful - I\u00a0couldn't believe it,' added Ms Perminas. 'We wanted to say our prayers on Mother's Day but we couldn't. My grandchildren had written a prayer. 'How do you explain that their great-grandma's grave isn't there because it's just a pile of rubble? I couldn't get to sleep the next night because I was just so devastated.' The grandmother-of-five had taken her family to visit the grave of her mother, who died last year at the age of 89. Since her death the family \u00a0have been saving up for a headstone but had placed a memorial plaque, vases and a Holy Mary ornament, which had been blessed by the Pope in Rome, on the grave. Ms Perminas said it was 'heartbreaking' to find her mother's grave covered in the large mound of soil . Jadvyga Perminas (pictured left, aged 28) died about a year ago and was buried in Carlton cemetery (pictured right about six weeks before her death last year) Last Wednesday Ms Perminas visited the site and left flowers and angel ornament. But when she returned just days later she found soil and large rocks had been dumped on her mother's grave, as another plot had been dug about six inches away. The family also believe the new plot encroaches on their land, because they bought three at the time so other family members could eventually be buried alongside Jadvyga. Ms Perminas, a jewellery dealer, added: 'We can't afford a marble memorial but it's irrelevant because it's still my mum's grave. 'I go to see it regularly and it was okay on Wednesday. Gedling Borough Council said the rubble had been placed on top of the grave while they dug a new plot . Ms Perminas' family almost didn't realise the pile of rubble was at the site of their relative's grave . Ms Perminas said flowers and ornaments, including of Holy Mary (blue) had been pushed aside . 'Everything I had left there was chucked to the side like it didn't matter. 'She loved the Holy Mary ornament and it cost hundreds of pounds. The plot belongs to us and they have no right to do that.' Ms Perminas's son Adrian said they almost walked past the grave at first, not realising it was under a heap of discarded rubble. He said:\u00a0'It can't have been an accident because they've had to actually move all the stuff, and it's not like there was nowhere else to put the muck. 'Either way, there shouldn't be a grave being dug so close. It's blood-curdling to think they could have disturbed my grandmother's grave.' Gedling Borough Council, which runs the cemetery, has apologised to the family. Ms Perminas said her family had been saving up for a headstone and were devastated by the grave . The plot was covered in flowers before the rubble had been dumped upon it in time for Mother's Day . Peter Barnes, portfolio holder for the environment, said: 'We are really sorry for any distress experienced by the Perminas family. 'Carlton Cemetery is a working cemetery, which means that graves are being dug out and prepared for new burials all the time. 'In this case, a grave was being prepared adjacent to the grave of the Perminas family and, as a result, earth was placed on the adjacent grave, pending the new burial. 'Given the close proximity between graves, this practice is often unavoidable but we always remove any earth that is left on adjacent graves as quickly as possible.' He said that any family items removed as part of a new grave being dug are returned to where they came from.",

        "article": "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United must spend big again this summer if Louis van Gaal's tactics are to bring success to Old Trafford. United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks. And former United midfielder Scholes, who has two season tickets at his old club, is unconvinced that Van Gaal's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad. Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Ashley Young during Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected at Old Trafford . Arsene Wenger was right! I would have loved to have played with Mesut Ozil... but only if he always performed like he did at Old Trafford . Writing in his column for\u00a0The Independent, Scholes said: 'Watching United at Old Trafford on Monday, I know what Louis van Gaal is trying to do with this team. I do like the concept. I just question whether he has the players to do it. 'In recent weeks, Van Gaal has tried what I would describe as a more Barcelona-style approach to games. His centre backs push wide, the full backs push on and the team pass the ball. It has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides, starting with Spurs and the high-pressing game they play, that you have to wonder whether it will be found out. 'To play this way, you really need to be exceptional. Barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years. United have spent around \u00a3220m in the last three transfer windows and yet I would question whether they have the players to operate this system.' Van Gaal has been criticised for utilising Fellaini's height and physical presence at times this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer . United were known for their relentless attacking under Sir Alex Ferguson and Scholes, who was an integral part of the Scot's midfield, wants to see fluid football back at Old Trafford. 'I understand what Van Gaal is trying to do,' Scholes wrote. 'I like that he is playing with the wide players. I also know that as former players we cannot harp on about the old days for ever. Things change, although I believe that certain principles, of attacking, entertaining football, should always be protected. 'Like any other match-going fan \u2013 I have two season tickets for Old Trafford \u2013 I want to see the team play well and win. I just don\u2019t think this system is the best for these players.' Angel di Maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a \u00a360million deal from Real Madrid . Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself out of favour under Van Gaal in recent months . Van Gaal's men are fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham but they could drop out of the Champions League places if they suffer defeat and rivals Liverpool win at Swansea on Monday night. Despite the club's precarious position, Scholes is adamant that the Dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window. He added: 'I still believe that Van Gaal is the right man for the job. I don\u2019t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play. He is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football. But I am afraid to say that if he wants to play this Barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it.'",

        "article": "A teenager who suffered amnesia and forgot her entire life regained her memory - after a hug from her little brother. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago after suffering a rare but serious side effect from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine. Doctors had tried everything, but the devastated teenager was still not able to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day at home, her brother Caleb, then six, walked into her room and gave her a cuddle. She claims at this point, her memories came flooding back. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago and was unable to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day, after a cuddle from her brother Caleb, now 7, her memories came flooding back . Miss Inman said: 'I had forgotten my entire life, which was absolutely devastating. I literally lost everything. 'Mum and dad would get very upset as I didn't recognise them and it was hard for them to deal with it. 'We had tried everything. I would look at family photographs and I knew it was me in them but I just couldn't remember anything about why I was there. 'It totally ruined me. I could not go back to school and I lost my family and friends and did not know who I was. It was dreadful. 'My brother and sister, who were six and eight at the time, didn't really understand. 'It sounds weird and is hard to explain but the first thing I remember was my little brother Caleb. 'Our bond is a really powerful thing and he just came in to my room and gave me a big hug. 'We have always had a close bond and a special relationship and somehow that moment just triggered everything coming back to me. 'After that hug all my family memories came back - every last one of them.' Miss Inman claims she developed severe amnesia nearly two years ago after suffering serious side effects from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine - after suffering severe headaches . Miss Inman had always suffered bad headaches but it was not until just before her 15th birthday that medical staff diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This meant she had abnormally high pressure inside her skull, which was causing excruciatingly painful headaches. She suffered the severe memory loss after doctors performed a lumbar puncture and found she had twice as much fluid in her spine than usual. Miss Inman, who lives in Plymouth, Devon with her parents Julie, 41, Daryl, 42, sister Ellie, nine and Caleb, now seven, said she was awake throughout the procedure. She said: 'It was like a switch was flicked and all my memories just disappeared. 'I didn't recognise my mum or my family. It was a weird feeling in my stomach as I felt like I knew them from somewhere but I couldn't think where. 'I immediately thought my mum must have been important as she did not leave my side through the whole ordeal. 'I thought she must be my mum but I didn't remember anything about her or anything that we had done together. 'It is a known side effect to the treatment. I have since heard that some people forget how to do their jobs and forget their families.' Chloe was sent home from hospital to try to re-jog her memories. But it was only the hug from her brother brought all her family memories back. She said: 'I was off school for two months. I didn't really understand what was going on - I just kept thinking \"I don't remember you\". 'But with my best friend it clicked immediately just by the way we started talking to each other. Miss Inman now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life . 'I had to fight the memory loss and now I remember nearly everything that I couldn't remember before and my life is slowly getting back together.' Despite this, her school work has suffered badly from the ordeal. 'I really struggled with school as I had to take so much time off and had to be taken out of all my lessons.' She now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life.' Miss Inman now studies performing arts at City College in Plymouth, Devon, and also volunteers at St John Ambulance. Her dream is to work as an Army medic. She said: 'It's quite scary looking back on it now. It did ruin my year and really my whole entire secondary school life. 'My pain was ignored for so many years. My consultant tested me for quite a lot of things and ran out of what to give me to help.' Chloe is now on a drug called acetazolamide to help reduce the fluid in her back - \u00a0and has fortunately not suffered from any headaches now for a year. She explained: 'My condition hasn't been properly diagnosed or treated yet because they don't really know what causes it. 'But they know that if it comes back to perform a lumbar puncture as a quick solution - but I'm terrified I could lose all my memory again.' She added: 'My condition is so powerful that it can kill people, either by it not being treated and too much pressure on the brain or people get fed up of being told it's just a headache that they lose faith and end up committing suicide. 'No-one really understands how painful it is.'",

But Nick Clegg's children also have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad-dancing in the kitchen \u00a0of their \u00a31.5million townhouse to\u00a0Meghan Trainor's hit 'All About That Bass'. Becoming the latest political leader to lift the lid on his family life, Mr Clegg spoke about the 'very strong' bond with his wife Miriam and their three sons, and baulked at the idea of betting his family home on his re-election in May. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg revealed how he enjoys dancing in his kitchen, and admitted some of his collapse in support could have been avoided . David Cameron posed in his kitchen chopping tomatoes and carrots, Nicola Sturgeon showed off her top-of-the-range coffee machine. But Mr Clegg suggested he uses his kitchen for dancing rather than cooking. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Lib Dem leader said: 'We are very lucky to have a very strong [family]. 'We both come from very strong, warm families and both of our families are large, boisterous, loud, warm families. 'We do sort of dance together a bit, we were all dancing in the kitchen to All About the Bass the other day and I don't think my kids were very impressed by my dancing but I enjoyed it.' He also revealed how his eldest son, Antonio, is almost too old for a fatherly kiss when he does the school run twice a week. 'He's 13\u2026 I still just get a little kiss in if I can,' Mr Clegg said. Mr  Clegg revealed how his children have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad-dancing with wife Miriam in the kitchen of their \u00a31.5million townhouse to Meghan Trainor's hit 'All About That Bass' Polls suggest the Lib Dems are heading for an electoral bloodbath on May 7, with Mr Clegg facing a battle to hang on to his seat in Sheffield Hallam. He has repeatedly insisted the party will defy the 'cottage industry' of pessimism, but stopped short of betting the family home on his survival. He told ITV's Kate Garraway: 'I'd put a very healthy bet on it. Would I bet my house? That's slightly unfair on Miriam and the boys if it goes pear shaped\u2026 . 'Do I think it is essential to have Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table? Unsurprisingly I really, really do. 'Politics is not for the faint hearted and what goes up, goes down, what goes down, goes up. You can't just give up.' Megaon Trainor's hit song reached number one in the UK and was one of the best selling singles of last year . He admitted he has faced a 'topsy turvy' time in government, and some of his collapse in support could have been avoided. He said: 'I think some of it, I'm sure not all of it, but I think some of it is probably inevitable. If you, as the traditional third party in Government, go into coalition with one of the two bigger ones, it's just a highly controversial thing to do.' Asked if he likes David Cameron, Mr Clegg replied: 'Um, it's not like or dislike really. We've worked out how to work together I suppose, it's quite a business-like partnership.'",

        "article": "A British couple on holiday in Goa were left with just 10p after their \u00a32,000 spending money was stolen from their hotel's safe. Dominique Pattrick, 29 and her husband Brett, 31, had been advised by staff at their three star hotel to store their valuables in a safety deposit box housed near the reception, but just four days into their trip it was raided. The padlock on the secure locker had not been tampered with but all their money, stored in two lockers, was missing. When they asked to inspect the hotel's CCTV, staff told the couple there were no cameras in the the safety deposit room as they feared it would be an 'invasion or privacy' for guests. Dominique Pattrick, 29, and her husband, Brett, 31, were left with just 10p to their name after \u00a32,000 was stolen from their hotel's safety deposit box . The money went missing just four days into the couples sunshine break in the three star hotel in the popular  resort . Bosses at the Silver Sand Hotel in Candolim, then landed them with a bill of \u00a313 for using the locker. Police in Goa suspect the money was stolen by a rogue member of staff at the hotel using a duplicate skeleton key. Mr and Mrs Pattrick, from Bury, Greater Manchester were forced to ring home to get their bank to activate their credit cards so they could finance the rest of the two week trip which was booked through Thomsons Holidays. Now they are only be able to reclaim \u00a3250 due to a clause in their travel insurance policy. Mrs Pattrick, an NHS therapist said: 'It was bad enough that the money went missing from the safety deposit box but to then charge us for using it was bare faced cheek. 'We were left with just a few rupees worth around ten pence and we had to ring home to unlock our credit cards to see us through. On arrival at the hotel the couple were advised to store their valuables in a locker located at the reception . 'The terrible thing was people were trying to make out that no money went missing at all. 'Goa used to be a special place and we got married there but I would never go back now.' The couple were holidaying with friends when trouble occurred on the fourth day of last month's trip. There were no CCTV camera in the secure locker room . Mrs Pattrick whose husband works as a mechanical engineer said: 'The hotel and Thomsons themselves suggested we did not keep valuables in the room and instead use the locker at reception and we assumed that was good advice. 'The money was kept in two wallets inside the locked deposit box along with a watch and four passports and the idea was to get small amounts of money every few days. It was a total shock to see the cash had gone. 'The safety deposit box was not tampered with and the lock was still intact as was left accordingly. Both wallets had even left zipped up as we left them. The only items not missing were our passports, watch and credit cards. 'We alerted the hotel and the police but we couldn't believe it when we heard there was no CCTV cameras in the area of the safety deposit boxes. The manager said there were no cameras in the safety deposit box room because he did not want guest to complain about invasion of privacy. 'It is pretty obvious what happened but they wouldn't accept responsibility for what happened to us. The manager said that the money would have been taken during the night because there were too many people around during the day and he went about calling the night receptionist and night porter to attend the police station for questioning. The police said the money was most likely stolen by a duplicate key.' A holiday rep from Thomsons logged a complaint but warned the Pattricks hotel staff doubted their allegations a rogue employee had taken the missing money. The group later moved to the nearby Marinha Dourada in Arpora. The couple had previously got married in Goa, but have said they would never return after the experience . Mrs Pattrick said her holiday was 'ruined' and she spent the whole break 'crying' as a result of the theft . Mrs Pattrick said: 'It was being implied we had stolen our own money or that the money was never in the safety deposit box to begin with. We were extremely distressed by what she was saying. 'We felt alone and unsupported from the hotel management and Thomson's reps. We just felt we could no longer stay at the hotel and the manager stated ' it was probably for the best we didn't stay at the hotel. 'Nothing was done to help us other than us requesting to move hotel to a lower star rating than we had paid for. The holiday was ruined. Lots of distress and upset was caused and we only had enough money to buy food and drink after the theft. 'Our money was stolen whilst it was in possession of the hotel and they had the timerity to charged us for it. This holiday was nothing short of a nightmare and we felt very much alone and isolated. I couldn't even tell my parents about it. All I did that holiday was cry.' A report by the Calangute police said: 'The unknown employee ie: receptionist and room boy of Silver Sand Hotel committed theft of 2000 pounds from the safe locker by using duplicate key.' A spokesman for Thomsons said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of the group's complaint. As soon as we were made aware of their reported loss our holiday advisors in resort did everything that they could to assist, including helping them to secure a police report for their insurance claim. 'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare and also take the opportunity to remind customers of the importance of taking out a travel insurance policy when booking their holiday.'",

        "article": "This is the moment a five foot long unexploded Second World War bomb discovered under a building site in south London was blown up. A controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at Cliffe in Kent this morning after the German device was discovered under a former pensioners home in Bermondsey in the Southwark borough on Monday. Soldiers of 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment) Royal Logistics Corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives  to blow up the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb. Scroll down for video . Explosion: The unexploded German bomb found in Bermondsey, south London was blown up at a quarry in Kent at 9am this morning . Detonation: Staff Sergeant Ed Clinton (left) and Sergeant Rich McKinnon (right), of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regt Royal Army Corps placed the charges on the bomb and then walked back to a safe area 500 metres to fire the charge . The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday. The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night. It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre. A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there. A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings. Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around. 'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes. 'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.' Proud: The soldiers from\u00a011 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Regiment Royal Logistics Corps stand in the hole left behind after the explosive was blown up . The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion at Cliffe in Kent (the quarry before, left, and during, right) could be heard 10 miles away. These pictures show the devastating effects the bomb could have had if it was accidentally detonated in London . SSgt Clinton and Sgt McKinnon carry spades to the site of the quarry, where two kilogrammes of high explosives were used to blow it up . The authorities warned that 'remaining in your home is placing your life at significant risk' and residents were forced out of their homes on Monday night. Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family. Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day. Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'. Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.'

Discovery: A Royal Logistic Core Bomb disposal expert checking the fuse on the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb at the site in Bermondsey, south London . Destruction: A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings . Dartford Police warned residents in Kent that there would be a loud explosion this morning but they needn't panic. The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion could be heard 10 miles (16km) away. Writing on Twitter, they said: 'EXPLOSION: Plz don't panic if you hear a loud bang... Army due to safely detonate a WWII UXB discovered in London yesterday.' Residents reported hearing a loud bang after the explosion at around 9am claiming it 'rattled' houses. Andy B posted on social media: 'Massive bang heard in Meopham, house shaken!!'. On The Thames said: 'Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #Bermondseybomb is no more!'. Residents were evacuated on Monady night after the 1,000lb German ordnance was discovered by builders under the old site of the Southwark Irish Pensioners. Pictured: Bomb disposal experts excavate the device . A bunker was built around the bomb by Royal Engineers of 33EOD to protect the surrounding buildings in case of accidental detonation. It was created from Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there .",

The 'heartbroken' artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre said he was overwhelmed by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night. Donations began flooding in as soon as news broke that the 120-year-old arts building was on fire at just after 4.15pm yesterday, which engulfed the roof and destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall. Nearly 1,000 people have now given money to an appeal set up by the charity National Funding Scheme which has raised more than \u00a322,000 in just 24 hours. More than 80 firefighters battled to bring the blaze under control, some fighting the fire from above using aerial platform ladders. Billowing black smoke was seen for miles around the theatre while there were reports of people watching on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed. London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building, including the 'priceless' octagonal dome, and salvage artwork from the centre, while some crews remained at the scene yesterday damping down hot spots. The centre reopened parts of the building  undamaged by fire for performances last night. Battersea's artistic director David Jubb said: 'The most important thing' was that nobody was hurt in the fire. 'It's heartbreaking. But we will get through this. Brick by brick. 'Huge thanks are owed to all the emergency services, who literally saved the front half of the building, to staff, artists and volunteers at Battersea Arts Centre, and to everyone who has shown their overwhelming support online over the last 24 hours. 'The passion for the building and the organisation is extraordinary. Thank you all for being part of this. We really need you at this time.' The cause of the fire is unclear but investigators were continuing to sift through the ashes yesterday to look for clues. Station Manager Matt Burrows, who visited the scene, said: 'Firefighters did a great job to save large parts of the building including the octagonal dome which I'm told is priceless and salvaged valuable art work. 'The centre are hopeful that they will be able to open unaffected areas of the building to the public today. We'll continue to damp down and our fire investigators are inspecting the building to find the cause.' Scroll down for video .

This incredible photo shows the flames of the inferno reaching up into the sky behind nearby homes who were warned to keep doors and windows closed against the smoke . Firefighters had advised people living and working nearby to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution after the fire broke out yesterday afternoon. By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters who battled to get the fire under control. An ambulance service spokesman said crews had treated a woman for smoke inhalation at the scene but she had not required hospital treatment. Nicholas Bennett, a magistrate at nearby Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court, said yesterday that black smoke had been 'everywhere, engulfing the  area.' Rumours that the nearby Clapham Junction railway station had been evacuated were confirmed false by Network Rail but Lavender Hill was closed in both directions. Battersea Arts Centre had tweeted that yesterday's performance of Missing was cancelled due to the blaze. Fire destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall but London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building including the 'priceless' octagonal dome . Flames had engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding . London Fire Brigade confirmed that half of the building was damaged by the fire with some parts being completely destroyed . 'Thank you to everyone for the kind words & well wishes,' a spokesman added. London Fire Brigade\u00a0Station Manager John Snelgrove, who was at the scene said yesterday: 'This is a large, challenging fire and crews are working hard to bring it under control. We've got 12 fire engines at the scene, as well as an aerial appliance and an aerial ladder platform fighting the fire from above. 'Firefighters are working with a number of water jets around the building to contain the fire.' Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters were called to tackle the fire Battersea Arts Centre with two aerial appliances - similar to cherry pickers - used to fight the fire from above. At the outbreak of the blaze the Brigade's control officers took over fifty 999 calls from members of the public. Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles from the arts centre as the fire took hold, which needed almost 60 firefighters to try and tackle it . Officers make their way to the blaze in Lavender Hill which has now been shut in both directions as firefighters continue to battle the fire . The London Fire Brigade said that eight fire engines and more than 80 firefighters were dealing with arts centre blaze in Battersea . The arts centre had tweeted: 'There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control.' Comedian Paul Foxcroft, who saw the blaze, said: 'The first thing I saw when I came out of my house were several fire engines hurtling past, then I saw grey smoke in the sky. 'Crowds had started to gather. There were two ladies outside with tears in their eyes. I heard one saying 'Please save it' as more firemen arrived. 'It is an institution, not just for Battersea, but for the whole of the city of London. It is hugely popular so this fire will affect a lot of people. The back of the building was under renovation.' There was an outpouring of grief on Twitter as people expressed their horror yesterday at losing part of the Arts Centre. Dan Price tweeted: 'So sad. London Fire fighting bravely to save Battersea Arts. Everyone is out safely.' Senior Producer at the BAC Richard Dufty tweeted: 'Terrible news. Battersea Arts is on fire. The Grand Hall roof.' Tom Copley \u200fsaid: 'Oh no! Battersea Arts, one of London's most wonderful theatres, is on fire. Hope that no one is hurt and that the building can be saved.' An ambulance service spokesman confirmed that crews had attended the scene but no-one was injured, while occupants nearby were warned to keep their windows closed against the billowing black smoke . The fire could be seen clearly from a nearby train station, sparking fears that Clapham Junction was being evacuated- the rumours were later confirmed as false . Fans of the centre also tweeted their support including James Phillips who tweeted about the 'tragic loss' of the building . Baylen Leonard wrote on Twitter: ' Awful news about fire at Battersea Arts Centre, one of the most innovative and forward thinking arts centres in UK.' Louise Allen-Jones posted: ' Devastated to hear Battersea Arts Centre is on fire. Love that building so much.' One twitter user said: 'Tower on the top of Battersea Arts Centre has just collapsed. People in tears. Police moving people back.' James Phillips added: 'The Battersea Arts Centre fire is apparently contained but large parts of the Grand Hall (which survived the Blitz) are gone. A tragic loss.' The building, which was designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountforcentre, was originally opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall. The space was converted to a community arts centre in 1974. The popular arts venue hosts a regular series of plays and dance shows. It is a registered charity, which raises 70 per cent of its own income every year. Fire crews have not yet been able to determine what the cause of the fire today at Battersea Arts Centre's Grand Hall roof .

        "article": "A San Antonio French teacher caught straddling a 15-year-old in her car. A Donna school security guard suspended for sending inappropriate texts to female students. A Waco band director who had sex with a high school girl in his music room. These are just three of the 74 cases of inappropriate sexual relations between educators and students that have been opened since September. The Texas Education Agency reported that, in the last three school years, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student-teacher relationship investigations in the state. San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison for producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student who he got pregnant. Lisa Zuniga avoided a long prison sentence because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. There were 179 investigations during the 2013-14 school year, compared to 141 probes in the 2009-10 period, according to the Houston Chronicle. The surge of cases in Texas corresponds to a national rise. There were 781 reported alleged cases of sexual relationships between students and school employees, according to the Washington Post. Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education, said that, on average, 15 new young people are reported to have been 'sexually victimized' by their teachers each week, he wrote in the Washington Post. Abbott's firm, Drive West Communications, has been tracking media reports of relationships between students and their educators. According to Abott, they found that Texas has the highest number in the country of teacher sexual misconduct cases. Abott believes social media services have made it easier for teachers to 'develop improper relationships with students out of sight of parents and principals,' he wrote in the piece. Brittni Colleps (left) was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But the lawyer for Ashley Zehnder (right) is arguing that she did not commit a crime by having relations with a student because the age of consent in Texas is 17 . He believes Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have 'created an open gateway for inappropriate behavior'. Some states are already taking action. In New Jersey, teachers are not allowed to add students on Facebook without written approval from their principal. They can also only contact students electronically if its done through district computers. A relationship between biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, and a boy on the school's squad came to light because of technology. Zehnder admitted to the relationship after the boy began showing a naked photograph she had sent him through Snapchat to fellow students at their Pasadena high school. The teacher's lawyer has argued that Zehnder did not commit a crime because the age of consent in Texas is 17. But some Texas teachers have been locked up for years after they were caught having sexual relationships with a student. Two Texas school districts have been rocked by multiple student-teacher relationships occurring just months apart, which included criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova and teacher Breanne Brown . San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison without parole this year after he was charged with producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student he had relations with and is now pregnant with his child. And Kennedale teacher Brittni Colleps was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But former teacher, Lisa Zuniga, was able to avoid a long prison sentence in 2003 because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. A South Texas school district recently got hit with a federal lawsuit after three employees were found to have had sexual relationships with students, according to the San Antonio Express-News. One of those employees, criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova, was the son-in-law of the Donna district's superintendent and allegedly had sex with a female student in his classroom. And barely a month after a health sciences teacher at the Abilene Independent School District admitted to having sex with a student, the district was rocked by another incident in January. According to police, teacher Breanne Brown had sex with a 16-year-old student on 10 different occasions.",

        "article": "(CNN)Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star, claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family, vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-Semitic remarks. In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with \"what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?\" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of \"offensive\" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to \"f---ing kill\" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to \"constant harassment\" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.",

        "article": "President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House this afternoon. As the pair sat in the Oval Office in front of the ornate fireplace, Obama told Prince Charles: 'I think it's fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the Royal Family.' When the 66-year-old said that news was 'awfully nice to know,' Obama added, 'They like them much better than they like their own politicians.' Scroll down for video . President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House . The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present . A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to\u00a0Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance. The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas. Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last . The pair shook hands and smiled broadly for the cameras as Camilla sat nearby on a sofa - she wore a pale gold coat . US President Barack Obama watches as US Vice President Joe Biden reacts to microphone booms moving nearer him . The press pool clamor round to pick up the president's comments . The pair were in good spirits and were both smiling widely during the meeting . Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them. Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun. He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. In December,\u00a0Prince William, who is second in like to the British throne, was invited to the White House by President Barack Obama . Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last. Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans. His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents. Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are directed to the West Wing doors of the White House in Washington DC . The Royal couple walk up the steps to the West Wing of the White House . Outside the White House an animal rights activist wore a a goose costume to thank Prince Charles y for his opposition to foie gras. Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. Outside the White House an animal rights activist wore a a goose costume to thank Prince Charles y for his opposition to foie gras. 'Charlie is my darling for banning foie gras from royal menus,' read a placard held up by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals activist. PETA labels as cruel the force-feeding of ducks and geese required to produce the liver delicacy. 'We wanted to thank him for his kindness and for setting a good example,' the activist, Ashley Byrne, told AFP. In 2008, Prince Charles said he had ordered his personal chefs to stop buying foie gras.",

        "article": "Guilty: Loretta Burroughs, 63, murdered and cut up her husband then hid the body for six years . A 63-year-old grandmother has been found guilty of murdering her husband, chopping up his corpse then moving it from house to house for six years. Loretta Burroughs pretended her husband Daniel had run off to Florida with a younger woman from the home they shared in Mays Landing, NJ. She was found guilty yesterday of first degree murder for stabbing her husband to death, chopping up his body with a knife and a saw, packing it into two plastic totes, and dragging it with her as she moved three times in six years. Loretta was about to move for a fourth time on May 17, 2013, from Ventnor, NJ to Villas, NJ, when authorities arrived at the door of her new home with a search warrant. They were investigating her for fraud in relation to the disappearance of her husband, Daniel S. Burroughs, 63, who was reported missing on September 1, 2007. 'She asked if we were also searching the Ventnor house,' testified Sgt. Lynn Dougherty of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office. When told that they were, Loretta's physical demeanor 'changed completely. Her whole body sunk. She lost the color in her face, she was wringing her hands, very nervous.' In the guest bedroom closet of Loretta's Ventnor home, Detective Caroline MacDonald of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags. As she started to open the bags, she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner. The boxes were transported to the morgue. Scroll down for video . Victim: Daniel Burroughs was missing for six years before his remains were found at his wife's home . Graphic: The jury was shown how the dead man's remains had been systematically taken apart . Gruesome: A woman's handbag, soaked in decomposition fluid, was found in one of the plastic totes. It contained the victim's skull and jawbone. Dr Charles F Siebert Jr, a forensic pathologist, began opening the boxes. Both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions, Siebert testified. He also found dryer sheets, air fresheners, and scented beads to mask the odor of death. Inside the first container, Siebert testified, he found a woman's handbag. 'I described it as olive but I didn't know the color, because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid,' he said. Inside the handbag were a 'cranium and mandible' \u2014 a skull and jawbone. The second, larger plastic container contained more bones, including the left upper arm and lower legs. Siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds. He determined that the person had died by homicide. Dr Stuart Alexander, a forensic odontologist, or dentist, from Cranbury, NJ, testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being Daniel Burroughs. Alexander compared Burroughs' dental records to the teeth in the skull. Donna Fontana, a forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes. 'There was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones,' she said. 'That means the bones were in a protected environment, with no sun exposure, and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals.' Fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones. She said the right tibia, which is the large bone of the lower leg, had been cut with a knife and a saw. Because the cut edge was the same color of the bone, she said it had been sawed at the time of death. Several vertebrae were missing, and others showed signs of trauma, including 'linear cuts as if produced by a knife.' Demonstration:\u00a0Donna Fontana, forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, uses a replica skeleton to show the jury where the bones of the victim's leg had been sawed. Forensic anthropologist Donna Fontana testified that all the wounds to the victim's ribs were made with a knife. The third rib on the left side was completely fractured. Fontana testified that several of the body's 24 ribs were also missing. Of the ribs that showed trauma, the injuries were consistent with knife wounds. One was completely fractured. 'There is a pattern of dismemberment,' Fontana testified. Dismemberment, she explained, is usually done 'to hinder identification and for ease of transport.' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Seth Levy argued that Loretta Burroughs murdered her husband, Danny Burroughs, for money. Danny disappeared on August 3, 2007. A few days later, Loretta told friends and family that he had left her. She said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow Hummer with Florida license plates. In reality, the prosecutor said, Loretta had killed him, and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder. Loretta worked at the Mey House Assisted Living Facility in Egg Harbor Township, NJ, now called Somers Place. In early June 2007, she asked attorney Enid Hyberg, whose mother was in Mey House, to draft a power of attorney. Loretta told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home, but Danny was going out of town. With the power of attorney, Loretta could complete the sale. Hyberg drafted the document. She did not charge Loretta, 'in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother,' Hyberg testified. A power of attorney needs to be notarized. In June 2007, Loretta asked Edward T. Dwyer, whose mother was also in the Mey House assisted living facility, if he knew anyone who could notarize it. 'She said her husband had left her, the house was sold, but the deal wasn't finished because he left,' Dwyer testified. 'I agreed to help her out,' he said. 'She was overly good and generous with my mother.' In June 2007, Dwyer asked his sister-in-law to notarize the power of attorney. Although Danny Burroughs was supposed to sign the document, he did not. Instead, the prosecutor said, Loretta signed Danny's name to it. Loss: Ray Wantorcik had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister-in-law's guilt . Ray Wantorcik, right, was finally able to hold a memorial for Danny Burroughs on May 10, 2014, almost seven years after he reported his brother missing. 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said. Nicole DiDomizio, Loretta's daughter by another man, testified that her mother frequently signed Danny Burroughs' name. In fact, she saw her do it between four and six times. After Danny's death, the prosecutor said, Loretta used the forged document to sell their home. The profit was $77,101. But the money was locked up in escrow, and Danny was entitled to at least half of it. 'She can't get the money if she is married,' Levy, the prosecutor, said. 'But she can get it if she is divorced.' Loretta filed for divorce on February 28, 2009, 18 months after she killed her husband. She told her divorce attorney, Daniel Alsofrom of Northfield, NJ, that her husband had moved to Florida and did not give an address. Alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the Press of Atlantic City. Loretta received half of the money when she filed for divorce, and the other half when the divorce was finalized, Alsofrom testified. As a result, the prosecutor said, between the profit from the house, and selling Danny's possessions, such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes, Loretta received close to $100,000. 'The defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years, with nothing left but the bones,' Levy said in his closing statement. 'The story ends with the defendant being $100,000 richer and Danny Burroughs in the defendant's closet.' After two hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Loretta Burroughs of murder and hindering her apprehension. For Danny's grieving half-brother, Raymond Wantorck, of Glenolden, PA, the conviction was bittersweet. 'Since they found my brother in May of 2013, I was kicking and fighting that I wanted it to go trial,' he said. 'I wanted my brother's remains to be shown to the jurors. 'I have to think to myself, it is my brother that brought justice to this case. He brought justice to himself. Pictures of his dismembered, horribly mutilated body, won the case.' 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said, 'and maybe for me.' Donna Andersen is author of Lovefraud.com. http://www.lovefraud.com/ .",

        "article": "There is no place in Darren McGregor\u2019s mindset for a soppy nod to his old allegiances. He let out a roar of relief, a leap of joy and a pumped fist of celebration after lashing home the key goal that condemned former club Cowdenbeath to a defeat that could damage their hopes of avoiding relegation \u2014 and helped Rangers draw menacingly level on points with his boyhood heroes Hibernian. McGregor\u2019s superb strike was the essential response to the visitors drawing level through Kudus Oyenuga and sparked a three-goal flurry in the final seven minutes that saw Rangers claim a first Ibrox victory since January 3. Darren McGregor led Rangers to a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath at Ibrox on Saturday . Rangers' Haris Vuckic celebrates his second goal during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox Stadium . Rangers' Lee Wallace and Cowdenbeath's John Robertson fight for the ball during the Championship match . The gloss finish was provided by super sub Haris Vuckic, who produced the other two late strikes. Rangers may have been landed with the worst-value loan deal in football history by former directors Derek Llambias and Barry Leach sanctioning the signings of four Newcastle fringe players who have been ill or unfit. But on this form \u2014 with five goals in nine appearances \u2014 the new regime won\u2019t be in a hurry to disentangled themselves from the deal that sees Vuckic here until the end of a season which now features a scrap for the most advantageous play-off positions. Rangers looked in no kind of shape to contend with McGregor\u2019s childhood favourites Hibs for that runners-up berth three weeks ago when they last faced Cowdenbeath. A scoreless shocker at Central Park was one of the most insipid Rangers displays of the past three seasons. The wind and churned pitch were offered up as mitigating factors following that dire effort, but there were no excuses here as a team revitalised by Stuart McCall to gain a first win in six last Sunday at Easter Road sought to build momentum in the spring campaign. Rangers fans celebrated the life of Davie Cooper in the first home match since the 20th anniversary of the wing wizard\u2019s death, with tribute banners and songs. McCall gave the player named after one of the greatest ever Ibrox heroes, David Cooper Templeton, a chance to star on the left flank against the strugglers. In his first start since January 10, Templeton was a marked man. Colin Marshall was booked after 70 seconds for a lunge on the ex-Hearts man. John Robertson soon followed into Brian Colvin\u2019s notebook. Cowdenbeath's Kudus Oyenuga scores his first goal of the game during the Scottish Championship match . Rangers' Vuckic celebrates his first goal during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox Stadium . Vuckic celebrates his second goal with teammate Ryan Hardie during the Scottish Championship match . That was no discouraging tactic because Templeton was in the mood for mischief and he did as much as any Rangers player to tire out the visitors with his trickery. Rangers quickly brushed off a bright start from the visitors that saw Cammy Bell shut down a Sean Higgins chance. The home side moved the ball around briskly, stretching and asking questions of a Cowdenbeath defence that had leaked 31 times in nine matches. Robbie Thomson kept out centre- halves Bilel Mohsni and Lee McCulloch with headers from corners. Nicky Law picked up the scraps of a mazy Templeton run to carve out a chance that smacked off the far post and fell kindly to the visiting keeper. Both home strikers Nicky Clark and Kenny Miller shot wide when presented with their goes at goal. McCall could have no complaints about the volume of chances being crafted by his side. Cowdenbeath\u2019s endeavours to stem the tide were overseen by Lee Makel, deputising for boss Jimmy Nicholl who was preparing for Northern Ireland\u2019s key qualifier against Finland, and he admitted that they rode their luck to go in level at the interval. Rangers needed a helping hand early in the second period and they got one from Thomson as the away keeper allowed a Lee Wallace drive squirm from his grasp. The penalty-box instincts of Clark beat Nat Wedderburn on the slide as he bundled the ball over the line just inside the left-hand post for his seventh of the season. Clark\u2019s grafting and harrying for the ball was noteworthy as Rangers strived for a second but the 23-year-old will have nightmares over his 71st-minute miss. Once again, Templeton tormented down the left and he delivered a devil of a low ball across the face of goal. Vuckic couldn\u2019t reach it but Clark looked to arrive in the nick of time at the back post to provide the finishing touch, but it was the side-netting that rippled from the forward\u2019s wayward shot. Miller\u2019s fresh air header wasn\u2019t much better and failure to put the game to bed meant that Rangers were only one slip away from losing their grip on the contest. Nicky Clark (left) scored the first goal for Rangers in the victory over Cowdenbeath . Rangers' Lee McCulloch and Cowdenbeath's John Armstrong during the Championship match at Ibrox . Nicky Law (left) has a shot at goal for Rangers in the Scottish Championship match with Cowdenbeath . Cue the latest Mohsni muddle as his ghastly pass was intercepted by Lewis Toshney, who spied Oyenuga in isolation 22 yards out. He spun without pressure and took a couple of strides before maintaining his composure and burying a powerful right-foot finish beyond Bell. All the old frailties were in danger of creeping back to bite Rangers as Templeton looked to injure himself attempting a clever backheel. McGregor was booked for a cynical foul to stop another Cowdenbeath break and fears of a fourth successive home draw brought scorn from the stands. McGregor calmed those nerves with his third goal for the club, latching on to a loose ball on the edge of the area and lashing a shot into the far corner. Makel threw caution to the wind in the hunt for another leveller but that played into the hands of Vuckic, whose class exploited the extra space. He and the excellent Wallace produced a terrific exchange of passes to scythe through the remains of the Cowdenbeath defence, culminating in the Slovenian tucking home a neat finish.",

The Lions looked set to collect their first win in nine attempts - and their first under interim boss Neil Harris - as they led 2-0 through goals in each half from Lee Gregory and Aiden O'Brien. But Brentford, also desperate for points at the other end of the table to maintain their promotion bid, pulled one back through Alex Pritchard's penalty before Odubajo snatched a 2-2 draw at the death. Moses Odubajo celebreates as he hits a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Millwall a precious three points . Millwall, looking revitalised since former striker Harris took over from Ian Holloway earlier this month, threatened first after just two minutes when Ed Upson found Martyn Woolford, whose shot from the edge of the box was parried by David Button. Brentford almost went ahead after 15 minutes through a glancing header from Spanish midfielder Jota, but the ball cannoned back off the crossbar. And in the 28th minute Millwall got their noses in front when Gregory latched on to Upson's long ball over the top, rounded Button and fired into an empty net from 15 yards. It was the former Halifax striker's sixth goal of the season and, tellingly, only Millwall's 14th away from home during a troubled campaign. Brentford: . Button Odubajo Dean (Smith - 71') Tarkowski Bidwell Douglas Peleteiro Ramallo Pritchard Diagouraga (Toral - 71') Dallas (Judge - 60') Gray . Substitutes:\u00a0Craig McCormack Bonham Toral Judge Smith Long . Millwall: . Forde, Cummings, Nelson, Hooiveld, Harding, O'Brien (Taylor-Fletcher - 77) Williams, Abdou, Upson, Woolford, Gregory . Substitutes: Fabbrini Beevers Gueye Archer Taylor-Fletcher Maierhofer Philpot . Brentford poured forward in search of an equaliser before half-time but found Lions keeper David Forde in inspired form, the Irishman tipping a Stuart Dallas curler over the top, blocking a header from Jonathan Douglas and turning Pritchard's free-kick around the post. Brentford continued in the same vein after the interval but Andre Gray fired over and Sid Nelson bravely blocked Jota's shot. And the Bees were hit by a sucker punch midway through the second half when O'Brien played the ball out to Woolford, continued his run forward and nodded the winger's lofted cross into an empty net from a yard out for his first senior goal. But Brentford were offered a lifeline with six minutes remaining when Woolford tripped Alan Judge in the area and Pritchard rifled home the penalty. And in the first minute of injury time, with Millwall pegged back in their own penalty area, right-back Odubajo fired through a crowd of players to snatch a dramatic equaliser. There was still time for substitute Gary Taylor-Fletcher to win it for Millwall, but the striker's shot flew agonisingly wide to leave the Lions players with their heads in their hands.",

Victoria Police say they\u2019ve taken him in for questioning but \u2018at this stage there\u2019s nothing to connect him to the crime\u2019. 17-year-old student Masa Vukotic was found with fatal stab wounds . In dramatic scenes, a man was surrounded by police before being taken away for questioning just metres away from where schoolgirl Masa Vukotic was found with multiple fatal stab wounds on Tuesday night. Police surround a man dressed in black near the scene of the crime before taking him away for questioning . The teenager was a a Canterbury Girls Secondary College VCE student who was known by friends as Marsi . Although the person taken in for questioning matches the description of the suspect, the Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia \u2018there are plenty of people who wear black jumpers so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything\u2019. Victoria Police could not confirm that he was remanded near the scene of the crime. The teenager was a Canterbury Girls Secondary College VCE student who was known by friends as Marsi.

Radamel Falcao bagged a brace for Colombia on Thursday night, but his double against minnows Bahrain is unlikely to rescue his Manchester United career. WHAT'S HOT . RADAMEL FALCAO . The Colombian  scored twice against Bahrain and the skies did not turn dark and deadly plagues did not strike. But looking at Bahrain\u2019s starting XI, his Manchester United resurgence is not a sure thing. Radamel Falcao celebrates the second of his two goals for Colombia in their friendly against Bahrain . Falcao pierces through the hapless Bahrain defence on Thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time . MANNY PACQUIAO . Or rather his massive calves. He gets severe cramps, poor chap, so needs a special anti-inflammatory cream. Alas, he doesn\u2019t have US medical insurance and so each small tube costs \u00a31,200. The \u00a395m he is set to make from fighting Floyd Mayweather should help. Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach (right) revealed his fighter suffers from bad leg cramps in training . AARON BADDELEY . The Australian golfer played one of the most absurd holes in memory at the par-four 17th in the Texas Open. He hooked his drive way left and went to look for it in the woods but declared it unplayable. He returned to the tee, reloaded and holed his drive from 336 yards for a birdie three. Andrew Magee (2001 Phoenix Open) has the only par-four ace in PGA Tour history. WHAT'S NOT . FERNANDO ALONSO . The Spaniard (below) has gone rogue. Again. This time he\u2019s blaming his McLaren car for last month\u2019s crash in practice \u2013 a version of events disputed by a 37-page report, numerous experts and 300 sensors on the car. Fernando Alonso IS blaming his McLaren car for last month\u2019s crash in practice . AUDLEY HARRISON . Sad to see a career that has drawn so much derision end with the revelation he is suffering brain injuries and faces bankruptcy. Boxers are a stubborn lot and Harrison was deluded, by his own admission, but those around him should have been stronger. Audley Harrison is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after retiring from boxing . KEVIN PIETERSEN . Poor old Pietersen. He jumps through all the hoops to play for Surrey in a competition that no-one really watches, all so he can maybe, hopefully, possibly play for England again... if an asteroid strikes the bus carrying all the selectors. Who could have known that years of egotistical behaviour and slagging off your captain would count for so much? Andrew Strauss feels Kevin Pietersen's efforts to play himself back into the England Test will be in vain .",

The results leave Carlo Ancelotti's men top, but just two points ahead of a Barcelona side who have a game in hand, while Filippo Inzaghi's Milan are 10th in Serie A with just eight wins in their 26 league matches. The Sunday papers in Spain and Italy have not held back in their criticism of the teams, with Corriere dello Sport's headline reading: 'No future for Inzaghi'. In Spain, 'Freefall' is the headline in Marca. 'No future for Inzaghi' reads the headline in Sunday's Corriere dello Sport after AC Milan drew 2-2 with Verona . AC Milan have struggled for the entirety of this season, and Inzaghi himself was coy about his future after the match. Corriere carry a quote from the former Milan player: 'Will I stay? I'm not the one to ask,' while Gazzetta Sportiva quote Pippo as saying: 'We gave away a goal like fools. I go forward with my head held high.' Nico Lopez was the scorer of Verona's all-important equaliser, in the 95th minute of the match. As Sportiva point out, he was the man who scored the goal against Inter Milan that led to the sacking of\u00a0Walter Mazzarri in 2014. There is crisis at two of Europe's biggest clubs as both AC Milan (left) and Real Madrid (right) failed to win . Over in Spain, Marca claim Madrid lacked ideas and character as they collapsed at San Mames. Despite being top of the league, there are high expectations from fans of Los Blancos, and the 1-0 loss to Bilbao was far from good enough. Aritz Aduriz scored the only goal of the game to 'turn La Liga upside down', and Ancelotti said post-match, 'it's quite confusing what we are doing in attack.' 'There it goes!' reads the headline in Sunday's AS, and they claim Barcelona will 'go out like a motorbike against Rayo', whom they play on Sunday lunchtime. Barcelona can go top of La Liga if they win their game in hand against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday lunchtime . Barcelona can go top of La Liga for the first time in 16 games with a win, and should that happen Ancelotti will have a real problem on his hands. Mundo Deportivo carry a quote from Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi, who left a message for his fans on his Facebook page on Saturday night. If they weren't already aware of the magnitude of their game, Messi's message 'We can't fail' will have certainly left no doubt in their minds.",

Pascal, 56, whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal, is set to head up her own production company as part of her leaving package. Up in smoke: Amy Pascal's office move has been delayed because of a stench of marijuana permeating the building, sources close to the disgraced Sony executive say . The new job role - with a four-year contract - is said to be worth between $30 million and $40 million. The exact location of her new base is not known but it is set to be somewhere in the heart of Hollywood. She will reportedly move into temporary offices until the odor of marijuana sufficiently eliminated. The scent has apparently soaked into flooring and brickwork but nothing a lick of paint won't solve. Source of the problem? The odor was reportedly left behind by funnymen Seth Rogen and his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, as they occupied the space for a short time . In an interview last month, Amy Pascal opened up about her departure and acknowledged it wasn't voluntary. Speaking to journalist Tina Brown at the Women in the World conference in San Francisco, Pascal joked, 'All the women here are doing incredible things in this world. All I did was get fired.\" After a long reign as the head of Sony Pictures, the studio announced Pascal was stepping down and would start a new production venture at Sony. In her new role as producer, she has already inherited several of the studio's biggest upcoming projects, including Sony's next Spider-man film, to be made in partnership with Marvel Studios.",

        "article": "A grandmother from Italy has accidentally poisoned herself, her partner, their son, grandchildren and one of their friends by making them hot chocolate from sachets that was 25 years out of date. The 77-year-old woman, named only as Mrs. Rosetta, from the northeastern town of Vicenza, made the drink after her grandchildren and their friend, aged between nine and 12, asked for it, making extra cups for her son, her husband and herself. Shortly afterwards, all of them were taken to hospital with stomach upsets and vomiting, which authorities traced to the sachets, which expired in 1990, according to\u00a0Il Giornale Di Vicenza. The woman, named as Mrs Rosetta, 77, was taken to hospital with vomiting and a stomach upset along with her husband, son, two grandchildren, and their young friend . It is thought that Mrs Rosetta bought the drink some time in the late 80s, before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen Square protests, and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. The chocolate powder had then laid at the bottom of her cupboard, forgotten, until one day earlier this month when one of her grandchildren asked for it to drink. Discovering the sachets at the back of the cupboard, she promptly mixed it into warm milk and served it, with disastrous results. According to Il Mattino her husband began suffering from vomiting and a stomach upset around an hour after drinking the chocolate, followed by herself, the children, and finally her son. The pensioner, from the town of\u00a0Vicenza, is thought to have bought the sachets some time in the late 80s - before the fall of the Berlin Wall and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister . All of them had to be rushed to the emergency room for treatment, with one of the youngsters being kept in for 20 days, reports Corriere Del Veneto. While it appears to have been an accident, the grandmother has been charged with causing injury, with a file passed to prosecutors for consideration. Hot chocolate mix usually contains powdered cocoa and sugar, which do not usually go off but will decrease in quality over time, and powdered milk, which can go off after long periods. Powdered milk is particularly prone to curdling over long periods if exposed to heat or moisture, or if the packaging is torn.",

        "article": "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to issue a humiliating apology after The Mail on Sunday exposed him for misleading the House of Commons over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of Jimmy Savile. In a statement to the House last week, Mr Hunt pledged that Savile\u2019s charities are responsible for paying up to \u00a340 million due. But this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt \u2013 and that it is the NHS which is liable. The Mail on Sunday has also learnt that a further bill, which may eventually be as large, will be met by BBC licence fee payers. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Jeremy Hunt speaking in the House of Commons last week where he pledged that Jimmy Savile's charities would fit the \u00a340 million bill due to his victims . Last night, in a major climbdown, a Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed that a statement to the House by Mr Hunt on February 26 was inaccurate. \u2018He will be writing to the Opposition to correct it,\u2019 she said. She said the NHS had not set aside a \u2018specific pot\u2019 of money, but added: \u2018We are committed to picking up any claims the estate cannot cover.\u2019 The Savile estate is already effectively bankrupt. Mr Hunt addressed the Commons after the publication of reports which detailed Savile\u2019s abuse of victims at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and elsewhere. He told MPs that a total of \u00a340 million was still \u2018under management\u2019 in two charities Savile established and \u2018that money will be made available to meet claims made by Savile\u2019s victims\u2019. Mr Hunt added: \u2018If it is not enough, the Government will meet any further claims through the NHS Litigation Authority.\u2019 Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate, which is already effectively bankrupt . However, although Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate. Last year the High Court and the Court of Appeal made clear that they cannot be asked to meet any compensation costs or damages. And yesterday it emerged that neither charity held anything close to \u00a340 million anyway. The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around \u00a31.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held \u00a33.4 million. Jo Summers, the charities\u2019 solicitor, said: \u2018There is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims, as this is not permitted by charity law. The only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds.\u2019 The BBC has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises. Yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the Corporation had earmarked, saying only: \u2018The terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims, as well as the NHS and the Savile estate.\u2019 As of November last year, the Savile estate was worth \u00a33.2 million. But almost all of this is certain to be eaten up in fixed payments to lawyers agreed under a \u2018fast track\u2019 compensation scheme for which about 200 people have applied. So far just 39 claims have been rejected. As this newspaper reported last year, under the scheme each claim will trigger payments of up to \u00a316,000 to lawyers. Further payments will be made to law firm Osborne Clarke, which runs the scheme on behalf of Savile\u2019s executors, NatWest. The firm had already been paid \u00a3500,000 when the scheme was approved by the Court of Appeal in November, and will be due more. In many cases, the damages paid will be less than the legal costs. The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around \u00a31.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held \u00a33.4 million . But this is not the end of taxpayers\u2019 liability. As well as claiming under the fast track scheme, alleged victims can also sue Savile\u2019s estate directly in the High Court. In last year\u2019s court hearings it emerged that numerous actions are being considered \u2013 with damages and costs likely to be higher. However, bedevilling these is a lack of documentary records, and evidence of some false claims by individuals. Ms Summers added: \u2018It seems impossible to quantify the potential bill. The number of abuse allegations greatly outweighs the number of claims being brought under the scheme. It could be years before the NHS knows the total cost.\u2019 Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \u2018It is of great concern that Jeremy Hunt could give such misleading information to victims and the Commons on a matter of this significance. He needs to return to the Commons at first opportunity to apologise to victims and correct the record.\u2019",

But Mike Basich has since shunned the frantic lifestyle and opted to live somewhere far closer to his beloved slopes. He now lives in a tiny, isolated cottage in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Truckee, California, and now lives with no electricity or indoor plumbing - but has 40 acres of slopes with no one else in sight. Scroll down for video . Former pro-snowboarder Mike Basich has built a tiny, isolated cottage in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Truckee, California, complete with its very own hot tub (bottom left) It is set in the middle of 40 acres of land with varying terrains - which he describes as his own private resort . The property took five years to build, and involved Basich moving 175 tons of rock and hand-mixing all of the cement used on the foundations and surroundings . It is set in the middle of 40 acres of land with varying terrains - which he describes as his own private resort. Speaking to Laura Ling from Seeker Stories, he described how the property took five years to build, and involved him moving 175 tons of rock and hand-mixing all of his cement. Now he has his own sanctuary complete with a hot tub and a chairlift he made from scratch with his friends. It operates through an electronic motor. Each chair has it's own tray to carry lunch and a drink while the route up has sculpture . 'I like to think of it as getting back to the basics of humanity,' Basich said. 'I like feeling connected to the earth more than I could with a 4,000 square-foot house. Next to the house is a chairlift he built from scratch with his friends. It took him eight months to complete . 'It gave me the strength to do everything myself. The project was fulfilling a childhood dream.' The house is fitted with an oven, made with a door picked up from a junk yard, and a fire where Basich does all of his cooking and heating. He sleeps in a bunk next to a stained-glass window and there are no curtains. 'I go to bed with the sun and wake up with it.\u00a0I don't feel like I'm trying to race time,' he added. 'Like in a city you always feel like you are in a rat race. And here it feels like you are in sync with what is actually happening.'

The out-of-favour striker took to Instagram on Monday to post a\u00a0cryptic\u00a0message, perhaps making reference to his current situation under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Alongside a picture of himself sitting in a car, the former Arsenal man wrote: 'When life puts you in tough situations. Don't say 'why me'. Just say 'try me'.' Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor attached a defiant message to this picture of himself on Instagram . Adebayor has made just 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham so far this season . Adebayor came close to joining West Ham on loan in the January transfer window and he has found it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino's starting XI this year. His last Premier League appearance came as a substitute against Sunderland on January 17 and he has just two top-flight goals to his name this season. Younes Kaboul and Etienne Capoue have also struggled for playing time in 2015 but Pochettino has refused to confirm whether the trio will leave White Hart Lane this summer. Former Arsenal striker Adebayor last played for Tottenham on January 24 in the FA Cup against Leicester . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has demoted Adebayor to the club's third-choice striker in recent months . Speaking about squad selection ahead of his side's 2-1 win at QPR on Saturday, the former Southampton boss said: 'Always for every game it's my decision, my choice. 'I think that you understand. In the end, all of our squad is fully fit and you need to pick players. 'I am happy with all, but if we have 26 or 27 players in the squad then more than 18 is impossible.'",

Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara. They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria. Scroll down for video . Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group . The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest. A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her. 'Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. The woman was detained in Turkey trying to cross into Syria (pictured), a known route for would-be jihadis . They said messages and images on her mobile phone indicated she was planning to head to Islamic State territory. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of government rules against speaking to the media without prior authorization. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the detention of a British national in Ankara and are providing consular assistance.' The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists. This is the moment two 'naive and impressionable' teenage cousins who dreamed of careers in medicine and engineering were stopped in Turkey by immigration officers at border control as they tried to flee  to join ISIS on Saturday . Exodus: Amira Abase (left), 15, and Kadiza Sultana (right), 16, also travelled to Istanbul from UK on February 17 before reportedly entering Syria - where they could now be under the control of deadly female insurgents . Last month three British girls \u2013 Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 \u2013 travelled to Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State. It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place. Yesterday a High Court judge took the unprecedented step of making a 16-year-old boy a ward of court in a bid to stop him travelling to Syria. The boy, who cannot be named because of a gagging order imposed by the court, is a member of a family steeped in militant Islam. He has dual Libyan and British citizenship. Two older brothers have been killed fighting in Syria and a third continues to fight despite being injured. An uncle was held in Guantanamo Bay. Mr Justice Hayden said he was concerned to 'keep this lad alive' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate. He said he was a vulnerable young person who had grown up in a family 'where the male members are patently committed to waging jihad in war-torn Syria'. The decision was made in the Family Division of the High Court after an application by social services at Brighton and Hove City Council. Life of terror: 15-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) - one of three British teenagers who is now believed to be inside Syria - contacted Aqsa Mahmood who is considered to be one of the leaders of brutal all-woman militant group al-Khansa .",

Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania, is offering \u20ac500 (\u00a3350) to the right man, who will perform the bedroom necessities and then leave. Although the man will provide the sperm, he will have no parental rights over the child whatsoever. Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania has posted a Facebook advert asking for a man to impregnate her . According to The Mirror, Adelina posted the advert on her Facebook page with the words: 'Meeting men is not a problem. Meeting one who wants a baby is.' 'So, rather than wasting my time on a pointless relationship I\u2019m going to pay for it.' Before she agrees to sleep with the potential partner or hand over any money, the man will have to undergo a fertility test and sign an agreement to waive rights as a father. Adelina added: 'Men are so immature all they think about is themselves. 'I am a mature, independent woman and I want a baby - not a man who behaves like one, but a proper one.' Adelina now has more than nine thousand followers on Facebook and even has her own fan page. Her announcement comes just a couple of weeks after a Russian woman advertised for a man to impregnate her online. Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia also recently advertised for a man to impregnate her . Elena Komleva, from Cheliabinsk in southern Russia, placed the advert on a social media website - and was soon flooded with offers.

Taking to her Vkontakt page - the equivalent of a Facebook profile - she wrote: 'My mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting. But nobody wants to marry me yet. 'So, if you are young, strong and healthy drop me a line. 'My mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner. She knows what I need.' She has already been inundated with offers from men, with many posting replies to her advert.",

Veteran broadcaster Nick Robinson has been abused online after announcing he is battling cancer. The BBC said at the weekend that its political editor is to take time off to have a tumour removed from his lung. But he was immediately the subject of vile abuse online from Twitter trolls who accused him of both pro-Tory bias and anti-SNP sentiment. Stephen Smyth, whose Twitter \u2018handle\u2019 \u2013 his online name \u2013 includes an SNP logo, sent a message reading \u2018karma\u2019 direct to Mr Robinson, 51, and the BBC. Other Twitter users described Mr Smyth as an SNP member and urged the party to expel him. Last night, the SNP had not confirmed or denied if he was a member. Phoenix45blog \u2013 the 45 seemingly a reference to the percentage who voted Yes \u2013 wrote: \u2018A bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good.\u2019 This prompted widespread condemnation on the site, with posters calling it \u2018vile\u2019 and \u2018disgusting\u2019. One, Alex, tweeted: \u2018You are one sad individual.\u2019 Initially, phoenix45blog replied: \u2018Nope, I\u2019m quite happy about this news.\u2019 But he later changed his mind, tweeting: \u2018I apologise unreservedly for the prior tweet. It was tasteless. I wish you a speedy recovery Nick. #contrite.\u2019 Jimmy James \u2013 whose Twitter profile sports the number 45 \u2013 said that \u2018diagnosis aside\u2019 Mr Robinson was an \u201c****hole\u201d. It was not just cybernats who were guilty of abuse. Maenad Nanna tweeted from Wales: \u2018Self-respecting lung tumour wants removing from mendacious @BBCNews Tory shill Nick Robinson.\u2019 When Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted he wished Mr Robinson well, one individual replied that he was a \u2018little Englander scumbag like that **** Cameron\u2019. A second tweet responding to the same message said: \u2018Looks like @DavidCameron\u2019s director of communications is off sick, poor man.\u2019 Sick: Two of the vile messages sent to the BBC political editor after he announced he has cancer . The comments were widely condemned \u2013 including by the SNP. Former Labour First Minister Lord McConnell said they were \u2018sick\u2019. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her support, wishing Mr Robinson a speedy recovery. The presenter became a hate figure among some Nationalists during the referendum campaign, with protesters outside BBC Scotland\u2019s Glasgow headquarters calling for him to be sacked for what they saw as biased coverage. At the time, Alex Salmond refused to condemn them, calling the demonstrations \u2018joyous\u2019. During the referendum campaign, the SNP was constantly embarrassed by the online army of cybernats. JK Rowling and David Bowie were two of many who earned their wrath for speaking out in favour of the Union. Dispute: The SNP had a public spat with Robinson, 51, during the campaign, with dozens of members making official complaints and some even calling him a 'liar' in banners as they paraded through Glasgow's streets . Last night, Scottish politicians warned such abuse threatened to silence democratic debate in the run-up to May\u2019s General Election. A Scottish Labour spokesman said: \u2018These tweets are beneath contempt. There is no place in Scottish life for this kind of bile. \u2018Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP must immediately distance themselves from these vile comments and call on their more extreme supporters to stop polluting social media with vicious personal attacks. \u2018This online bullying is in danger of destroying public debate.\u2019 A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u2018These comments are despicable, but won\u2019t surprise anyone who saw the depths some people stooped to during the referendum campaign. \u2018It\u2019s important all political parties lead by example and condemn this sort of behaviour.\u2019 An SNP spokesman said: \u2018We deplore all internet abuse, as we have made consistently clear, and the First Minister has wished Nick Robinson well for a speedy recovery.\u2019 When Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted he wished Mr Robinson well, one individual replied that he was a \u2018little Englander scumbag like that **** Cameron\u2019 Mr Robinson hopes the operation to remove a bronchial carcinoid tumour from his lung will take place within the next month so he can return to work before the General Election. He remarked of his illness and its proximity to the election: \u2018Timing lousy. Prognosis good.\u2019 Both the broadcaster\u2019s parents smoked, but while he has admitted to the \u2018odd drag on cannabis at university\u2019, he has said he has always been so anti-nicotine that he \u2018was the sort of irritating child who used primary school art classes to make anti-smoking propaganda\u2019.",

Ted Wiseman claims his wife of 46 years, Yvonne, is complaining about his bed time habits and the tidiness of the house they shared in Halesowen, West Midlands. The 79-year-old admits that the love-of-his-life, who died at 65 from a stroke in May 2014, had always worn the trousers in their relationship. Ted Wiseman says his late wife has been contacting him from beyond the grave ever since she died last year . Mr Wiseman's wife Yvonne died at 65 from a stroke in May 2014. The couple are pictured on a night out over Christmas in 2012 . Mr Wiseman said his late wife gave him a stern telling off from beyond the grave because he was wearing her slippers (file picture) But in the last year, he says, his wife has been contacting him from beyond the grave - and telling him off for wearing her slippers and sniffing in bed. Mr Wiseman said: 'Yvonne was the gaffer so I'm not surprised she's still bossing me around now. 'Last month I left a tea towel on the side, and when I turned around it had been put back in its rightful place. 'Yvonne was so house-proud that she hated anything being out of place. I was drifting off to sleep the other night when she told me to \"Stop sniffing\". 'She always used to complain about my habits in bed. 'Some people might be upset about being nagged by their wife, but it's quite comforting to me.' Throughout Mrs Wiseman's life she not only controlled her adoring family, but everyone else who came near the house. Mr Wiseman (left) says his late wife Yvonne (right)\u00a0is complaining about his bed time habits and the tidiness of the house they shared . Mr Wiseman is pictured holding a detergent ball that he says Yvonne put in the washing machine when he had left it out . Mr Wiseman said: 'One day a young lad knocked on our door saying he was being chased and could he come in. 'Yvonne was having none of it and just chased him back down the driveway. 'Although she was strong and forthright, Yvonne was never nasty. I'd often suggest going places or doing something and she'd just chuckle and say \"no\". And that was the end of that. 'I never won those arguments.' During their marriage, Mr Wiseman, a former lollipop man, and Yvonne, a care home worker, had two children and five grandchildren. Son David was with his father when Yvonne first made her presence known from the other side. Mr Wiseman says his late wife has been telling him off for wearing her slippers and sniffing in bed . The pair were sitting in an Indian restaurant when they watched a side dish slowly glide across the table to rest next to Ted. David, 45, said: 'We were waiting for mains and there were dishes all over the table. 'It was perfectly flat, but all of a sudden this one dish moved from one side of the table over next to me. 'I just knew there and then mum was still with us. She was always trying to sort us out, even when we were out and about.' After that meal, Mr Wiseman contacted a medium to help explain the ghostly goings on. During her visit, he said he received a stern telling off from his late wife through the clairvoyant demanding he take her slippers off. Mr Wiseman said he received a stern telling off from his late wife through a clairvoyant - demanding he take her slippers off . Since then, Mr Wiseman claims Yvonne has moved a dirty soap dispenser off the kitchen worktop and even helped with the laundry. He said: 'I had just put a load in the washing machine and had put some condition on the top. 'When I turned around to grab the powder and start the wash, the conditioner had gone. I checked the drawer and it was already in there.' All of Yvonne's visits have made Ted a believer in the afterlife. He said: 'I used to be a sceptic, but not anymore. I'm seeing it almost every week at least. 'It's definitely happening to me through Yvonne.'",

        "article": "\u2018There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress,\u2019 Charles Dickens wrote about having to chasing a hat in The Pickwick Papers. But in the modern world, the same could easily be said about repeatedly forgetting an important password. Now researchers have turned to the great Victorian author to help find a way of making passwords both secure and more memorable. Researchers have turned to the works of Charles Dickens (illustrated) to generate secure but memorable passwords according to new research by US-based computer scientists.\u00a0They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords . They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords. The process works by looking for two characters that commonly appear together but then generating a third letter that does not. Millions of internet users still rely upon easy-to-crack passwords such as \u2018qwerty\u2019 and \u2018123456\u2019, but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts. However, a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise. Researchers have shown that passwords such as \u2018mnbvcxz\u2019, \u2018qaz2wsx\u2019 and \u2018adgjmptw\u2019 can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength. The analysis was made by hosting firm WP Engine\u00a0using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant Mark Burnett. They spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people. For example, \u2018qaz2wsx\u2019 was in the top 30. They also noticed that a website called Zxcvbn scored these words as zero, or low, for so-called entropy. Entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of \u2018information entropy\u2019. This comes from information theory and is measured in bits. The more bits a word is assigned, based on the number of guesses it would take to crack, the stronger the password. Other words that received a low score include \u2018qwertyuiop\u2019, \u20181qaz2wsx\u2019 and \u2018zxcvbnm\u2019. This is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard, known as \u2018keyboard walks\u2019. The same approach is used to generate the third character using the second and third letter and so on. The result is 56-bit passwords that look like English but are not, making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess. Among the examples produced by the approach from the Tale of Two Cities were: 'The cusay is wither?' and 'Ther highly to a vice of eart'. This password would be entered as they are typed above, including spaces. According to Dr John Clements, a computer and software engineer at the California Polytechnic State University who devised the approach, these are easier to remember than random strings of letters and characters that are often recommended by password generators. He said: 'Users are very bad at choosing passwords. 'Today, the general assumption - evidenced by the lack of systems using randomly assigned passwords - is that users cannot be expected to recall secure passwords . 'If we\u2019re convinced that random passwords are a good idea, and that recalling a 56-bit password is at least within the realm of possibility, we must try to find a set of passwords that are as memorable as possible.' Research on passwords has shown that most people tend to use letters or words that are easiest for them to remember. Mark Burnett, a Utah-based password researcher who recently published a list of 10 million passwords taken from those shared over the internet, found that the most commonly used password is 123456 followed by the word password. Others tend to use their own name or use a password that is identical to their username. These are easy to break as most hackers will use easy to remember passwords when trying to break into an account. They will also tend to use real words when attempting to guess someones password. The graph above shows the distribution of letters following 'ca' in Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.\u00a0Among the examples produced by the approach from the Tale of Two Cities include: 'The cusay is wither?' and 'Ther highly to a vice of eart'. These would be entered as they are typed, including spaces . 1. 123456 . 2. password . 3. 12345 . 4. 12345678 . 5. qwerty . 6. 1234567890 . 7. 1234 . 8. baseball . 9. dragon . 10. football . 11. 1234567 . 12. monkey . 13. letmein . 14. abc123 . 15. 111111 . 16. mustang . 17. access . 18. shadow . 19.\u00a0master . 20. michael . 21. superman . 22. 696969 . 23. 123123 . 24. batman . 25.\u00a0trustno1 . Source: Mark Burnett . Online security experts recommend using a random string of letters, numbers and characters that use both upper and lower case letters. An eight-character password generated in this way can produce around 72 quadrillion possible variations - making it virtually impossible to guess. However, these are difficult to remember. Dr Clements' approach, which was highlighted by the magazine New Scientist, uses Markov models which are a way of generating random states based on states that currently exist. In the approach he took, two letters like 'ca' may appear together in a piece of text, then the chance that they are followed by the letter 'r' is 278/1397 for example. However the chance of those two letters being followed by the letter 'f' or 'x' is far less in that piece of text. By randomly generating letters using an algorthim that selects those letters based on meeting certain pobability rules of it appearing with the two preceeding letters in a piece of text, the method produces random but familiar looking passwords. Dr Clements said that the approach is not just limited to the works of Dickens. Indeed it could be used to generate passwords from a person's own emails, for example. He said: 'Naturally, the choice of A Tale of Two Cities is largely arbitrary - any corpus of reasonable length will suffice. 'One intriguing possibility would be to choose the full text of all of the e-mails in a particular user\u2019s history. 'This text would presumably reflect the style of text that a particular user is accustomed to read and write, and should in principle be extraordinarily memorable.'",

But just yards from where the upper classes of the capital resided in opulence, the poor scratched an existence in chronic misery in East End slums. Disguised as a stranded sailor, American journalist Jack London took to the streets of Whitechapel to document the struggles of London's destitute, in what is believed to be the earliest contemporary account of life on the city\u2019s streets. He wrote The People of the Abyss (1903) based on his first-hand account of living in the East End for several months the previous year, sometimes staying in workhouses or sleeping on the streets. In eighty-six days he gathered an enormous amount of material, read hundreds of books and thousands of pamphlets, newpapers, and Parliamentary reports, composed his book, typed it all out, took two-thirds of the photographs with his own camera. The conditions he experienced and wrote about were the same as those endured by an estimated 500,000 of the contemporary London poor. Now the seminal work has been republished as handbound box set.

        "article": "(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington. The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference. While some of Netanyahu's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state, the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu's baseless charge that Iran's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission. The earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing Netanyahu's message to the American people. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament, painted Netanyahu as the leader of a \"tin pot regime\" that is not as concerned about Iran's nuclear program as it is of Tehran's growing regional influence. The hardline Kayhan newspaper, the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the speech \"trash talking\" but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction. The paper, skeptical of President Hassan Rouhani's nuclear negotiations with the Americans from the beginning, said Netanyahu's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in Tehran: the Israeli leader and his American supporters are openly signaling the dispute with Iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there. Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it. As one hardline newspaper, Khorasan, put it, \"although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran, the [recent] remarks of the two [leaders] shows that they both seek the same goal.\" The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners' stance in Tehran. The moderate outlets, supportive of President Rouhani, have put a different spin on Netanyahu's speech. Unlike the hardliners, they are not painting the Obama-Netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from Tehran. Instead, they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the U.S. and Israel. The moderate faction sees the controversy around Netanyahu's speech to the Congress and his failure to squeeze the Obama White House to toughen its negotiation terms with Tehran as an indication that Netanyahu is the one who is isolated. The hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point, and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 Democratic members of the Congress from Netanyahu's speech. It is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary Iranians to Netanyahu's speech. But one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary Iranians outside the corridors of the state: his invocation of festival of Purim, which commemorates the salvation of Jewish people in ancient Persia. The historic event is recorded in the Book of Esther but Netanyahu's characterization implied that the Persian people's history of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the Jewish people is an ancient mission. \"Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us,\" Netanyahu said. With that line, he put the ruling Islamists in Tehran on par with ruling Persian empires that have come before them. As is already evident in the Persian-language social media, this will not go down well with ordinary Iranians, many of whom are not supporters of the Islamist system in Tehran and will resent the charge of eternal Persian anti-Semitism. They wish Netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the Islamist rulers in Tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-Semitic views -- and the people of Iran whose history with the Jewish nation is far more amicable than Netanyahu's portrayal of history suggests. What is more instantly measurable is the impact of Netanyahu's speech among officials in Tehran. The Iranian response to Netanyahu's speech to the Congress is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power. For the moderates, the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder Netanyahu got from the White House is itself a vindication of President Rouhani's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to Iran's 12-year nuclear saga. The hardliners have been quick to paint Netanyahu's visit to Washington as an example of the insincerity of the Americans in dealing with Iran, but not even the hawks in Tehran are claiming that Netanyahu's presence in the U.S. Congress is grounds to shift Iran's nuclear diplomatic strategy.",

        "article": "As a Tory MP in the 1980s Harvey Proctor had a special talent. Some MPs courted attention through their colourful personal lives. Others with their extremist political views. Harvey Proctor found controversy in both. In an age before politicians were out of the closet \u2013 and when the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21 \u2013 it was an open secret in Westminster that the impeccably turned-out Proctor was gay. But his political downfall in 1987 \u2013 accompanied by newspaper headlines of teenage rent boys and spanking parties \u2013 was one of the most dramatic scandals in recent memory as he pleaded guilty to charges of gross indecency after repeated public denials that he had done anything wrong. Harvey Proctor, former Tory MP, had his home searched by police as part of a probe into historic allegations of child sex abuse . Downfall: Harvey Proctor on his way to magistrates' court in 1987 to answer charges of gross indecency . As for his politics, his views on immigration were considered so far beyond the pale that while serving as an MP he was beaten unconscious at a demonstration in Scarborough, had red paint thrown over him when addressing Coventry University, and burning papers were thrust through the letter box of his tiny terrace home in Billericay. He shared the house with his feisty mother Hilda. \u2018I\u2019m the only woman in his life,\u2019 she once told reporters. It wasn\u2019t quite true. There was also Margaret Thatcher. Proctor, who became MP for Basildon in the 1979 general election which swept Mrs Thatcher to power, was a lifelong fan of the Iron Lady. Proctor\u00a0was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys to the media . But within weeks of being elected he was irritating her and the Tory high command with his strident views on migration, backing a motion calling for a ban on immigration from Commonwealth countries. Urging the abolition of the Commission for Racial Equality, he demanded the forcible repatriation of 50,000 \u2018coloured\u2019 immigrants a year, proposing a \u00a37,000 payment to encourage them to go. He was also one of seven Tory MPs who rebelled against legislation allowing parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment in schools. And he attempted to halt the growing tide of political correctness by launching a campaign to save the golliwog. Born and brought up in Scarborough where he went to the local grammar, Scarborough High School for Boys, he eschewed his Christian name, Keith, and always went by his second name, Harvey. He studied history at the University of York, where he had his first of many brushes with notoriety. As chairman of the university Conservative association he invited Enoch Powell, who had been sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet after his \u2018rivers of blood\u2019 speech on immigration, to make a keynote address. There was a predictable uproar and the meeting became a riot. It was a sign of things to come \u2013 whenever Proctor addressed a university as an MP he was the subject of angry and often violent protests. After university he worked for the Conservative Party research department in Old Queen Street near the Houses of Parliament. By the time he became MP for Basildon in 1979, he was already a darling of the Tory Right as a leading figure in the notorious Monday Club, a lobby group for the Conservatives but considered so extreme that in 2001 the party severed all links with it. The group advocated voluntary or assisted repatriation for non-white immigrants, capital punishment, and denounced Nelson Mandela as a criminal and terrorist who deserved to be locked up. Tall and gangly \u2013 he was once described in the Commons as a loping greyhound \u2013 the softly spoken Proctor revelled in the notoriety of being one of the most outspoken voices on the Tory backbenches. On Wednesday, detectives arrived at Belvoir Castle (pictured) near Grantham \u2013 the seat of the Duke of Rutland \u2013 where Proctor has lived since 2003, and searched the 16,000-acre estate . When Labour-controlled Basildon council passed a motion of no confidence in him as the local MP because of his views on race, he was delighted. After the re-drawing of political boundaries jeopardised his majority in Basildon, he was selected for the safe neighbouring seat of Billericay, which he won convincingly at the 1983 election. Proctor was loved by his local party because of his uncompromising views. He called for the suspension of grants to students if they lacked self-discipline and for administrative and other non-academic parts of universities to be sold to the private sector. His devoted Tory followers in Basildon and Billericay were oblivious to his homosexuality. While he was out with political friends he never discussed his private life. \u2018It\u2019s not relevant to my work as an MP,\u2019 was his stock reply. Fiercely ambitious, Proctor was consistently overlooked for ministerial preferment by Mrs Thatcher because of views on immigration which even some Tories viewed as racist. The Whips, in charge of party discipline, also feared his sexuality would be an issue that would return to haunt them. They were right. The first story to emerge in public about it was in 1981, when Terry Woods, a flamboyant art dealer who was his boyfriend, had left the MP\u2019s London flat after a row and Proctor refused to let him back in. The fracas led to a court appearance in which Woods claimed he was in a relationship \u2013 albeit it a very tempestuous one \u2013 with the MP. Proctor repudiated the claim and got away with it. Lurid allegations surfaced in a Sunday newspaper in September 1986 claiming he had organised gay spanking sessions with canes and teenage rent boys in his flat \u2013 allegations he dismissed as monstrous. Proctor resigned after he was charged over spanking parties with teenage rent boys at his flat and lost his house and flat, before signing on the dole . He was embarrassed again soon afterwards when Woods, who remained his long-term lover, was found in his underpants by the police outside the MP\u2019s apartment. He admitted that he \u2018loved\u2019 Proctor but insisted the relationship was not sexual. Days later a story emerged of how a naked Arab boy had been found under Proctor\u2019s hotel bed on a Tunisian holiday. When police eventually charged him over the teenage rent boys in his flat, Proctor bowed to the inevitable and announced he was standing down as an MP, admitting to a charge of gross indecency and accepting a fine of \u00a31,450. Proctor was ruined. He had to sell his house in the constituency and the flat in London and was on the dole for a year. But with the help of a \u00a32,000 government grant and friends \u2013 including Jeffrey Archer, Michael Heseltine and other MPs who between them raised \u00a375,000 on his behalf \u2013 he turned from politics to hosiery, opening a shop, Proctor\u2019s, in Richmond selling shirts, gaudy waistcoats, silk ties, and natty cuff links. Infamously, he hung a sign in the shop window saying: \u2018Shirt lifters will not be prosecuted.\u2019 Initially business seemed to be flourishing \u2013 John Major, when he became Prime Minister, ditched his Marks & Spencer shirts in favour of Proctor\u2019s more elegant wares \u2013 and he opened a second shop in Knightsbridge. But he could never escape his past. One day in 1992, two men walked into the Richmond shop. One of them demanded: \u2018Have you any boys for tying up before you spank them,\u2019 and then the men started punching him. After a \u00a32,000 government grant he set up a chain of shops under his name selling shirts, ties and cuff links . Proctor\u2019s friend Neil Hamilton, then a government minister and in the shop at the time, came to Proctor\u2019s aide and received a broken nose for his pains. From then on, the shops went into decline. They were forced into liquidation in 2000 and Proctor disappeared beneath the radar only to re-emerge in 2004 at the Duke of Rutland\u2019s ancestral seat, the gothic Belvoir Castle, where he is the events manager. The 68-year-old Proctor now lives in a large country house on the 18,000-acre estate near Grantham \u2013 the birthplace of his heroine Margaret Thatcher. A house now being searched by the police.

        "article": "A Catholic high school has enraged hundreds of teenage girls by banning some types of dress from its prom, and demanding students send in pictures of their outfit for approval. Delone Catholic High School, a $5,000-a-year school in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania, started making the demands of its students this year. Authorities have declared war on short hems, cleavage, bare midriffs and nude-colored linings ahead of the May 1 prom. Banned: The above two dresses both violate the rules of Delone Catholic High School. The right-hand dress was deemed acceptable when a 'modesty piece' was added . Delone Catholic High School, a $5,000-a-year school in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania . Some girls say the guidelines were sprung on them by surprise, and have been forced to alter their gowns, or, worse still, been left with inappropriate garments that they can't take back, according to local station Fox 43. Simone Hostetter, who owns a local dress shop, told the channel that parents were being driven to despair by the policy, which could leave them more than $300 out of pocket. She said: 'They\u2019re frantic, more so the parents have been really frantic, calling me with, \"Please, please please would you exchange her dress it\u2019s not allowed.\"' Naked controversy: 'Nude' linings, such as those on the dresses above, were deemed unacceptable at the school, and banned . Hostetter has changed her policy to allow returns in this case - and has started published pictures of her dresses on Facebook, spelling out which ones pass the school's modesty test, and which do not. The school insists the sartorial censorship is vital to preserving 'Catholic values and moral integrity' at the school. In a statement it said guidelines were spelled out in September, and the 'only change' from previous years is a requirement for girls to send in pictures for advance approval. They said the move was a preferable alternative to turning students away at the door. Allowed: These two dresses did pass the test of prom censors at the school. Students and parents are petitioning for the new rules to be dropped . Students and parents have expressed their outrage online, starting a Change.org petition aimed at swaying the principal. It calls the new standards 'antiquated and unreasonable', and complains that the prom is so soon that they have no time to act on the rule change. Writing underneath, student Cheyenne Altland said: 'I feel that my fashion choices for prom do not have any bearing on the strength of my Catholic Faith and my school can not tell me otherwise.'",

But 27-year-old YouTube sensation Andrew Ucles, who hails from Wollongong, south of Sydney, is not your average Joe. In a peculiar new video uploaded to his channel this week, the animal enthusiast lies on a large meat ant nest in a dubious bid to walk in the shoes of an echidna. Andrew Ucles drops down on top of the nest of angry meat ants, with the colony quickly swarming over his body . \u2018I thought I would try to stick it out for 10 minutes on an ants nest to give me some sense of an idea what feeding time is actually like for an echidna,\u2019 he commentates. Despite the ear plus jammed in his nose for protection, Ucles falls short of his goal, lasting about 30 seconds before lurching to his feet. \u2018I\u2019ve got ants in my pants\u2019 he declares, laughing maniacally as he bounds into a nearby lake. Earlier in the same clip, Ucles-who aspires to Bear Grylls and Steve Irwin-scoops up an echidna with his bare hands.

In another video uploaded last month, Ucles he uses a red bellied snakes to lure rabbits out of their burrows and capture them in his trademark style. A graduate of Environmental Science, the rogue environmentalist snares the likes of snakes, crocodiles and sharks with his unprotected mitts. Ucles claims his barehanded method teaches people about the fragility of ecosystems, in turn promoting animal conservation. While his logic isn\u2019t exactly hole-proof, his popularity is: Ucles YouTube channel has over two million views, and he\u2019s recently featured in an internationally acclaimed television documentary.

Ucles reportedly stayed with an aboriginal tribe in dentral Queensland, who taught him their lifestyle and hunting techniques.",

The Poland international is expected to feature in the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United on Monday night, provided he recovers from the virus which stopped him from being on the bench for the midweek Barclays Premier League win at QPR. Szczesny, 24, has not started a league game since the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, where he was culpable for the goals and afterwards was also caught smoking in the showers. That indiscretion resulted in a fine from the club. Wojciech Szczesny (right) has not started a game for Arsenal since Southampton on New Year's Day . The Polish shot-stopper has been ousted by David Ospina (right) but is likely to play on Monday night . Despite Colombian David Ospina making the most of his opportunities in recent weeks, Wilson, part of the Gunners' 1971 league and FA Cup-winning side, still believes 6ft 5in Szczesny has what it takes to cement a regular place between the posts once more. 'From the time Wojciech got into the Arsenal first team there were a lot who asked if he was good enough and I thought, \"this boy has the potential to really be a solid, outstanding goalkeeper\". I still believe that because he is - for his position - still relatively young,' Wilson said. 'All I would a say to him is \"look, Arsenal is one of the greatest football clubs. If you go from here I am not sure you are ever going to get a club as good as this. At your age now you need to dedicate yourself to being the best you can be, to the exclusion of a lot of other things in your life\".' Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson says\u00a0Szczesny must work hard to regain his place in the team . Ospina has made the most of his opportunity, tying down the No 1 goalkeeping position at the Emirates . Wilson recalled: 'I was a very late starter, but once I was in the Arsenal side, my family almost came second to my ambition. 'I devoted every moment to regular training and then when the boys went in for their bath, I stayed out [on the field]. 'I wanted to make sure I never ever left the game saying I could have been better, so my message to Wojciech would be \"come on, prove how good you can be\".' Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is confident Szczesny, who has played in Arsenal's last two FA Cup ties, will be sharp if selected again. Arsene Wenger (centre) will have a tough choice on his hands if\u00a0Szczesny (right) impresses in the FA Cup . 'Wojciech is used to playing in big games and I think he will take that as a big challenge to show his quality,' the Gunners boss said. 'He works very hard in training, so I don't think that will be a problem.' Arsenal head to Old Trafford in search for a first win there since September 2006, but on the back of good league form. Wenger said: 'We are the holders of the FA Cup, this competition is important to us and we want to go there to produce a result.'",

But now the buxom blonde - formerly brunette - has garnered such status that Kardashian lookalikes are cashing in on their likeness of her - to the tune of thousands. Jo\u2019Anne  Patton, 32, has had so much success as a Kim Kardashian lookalike in Leeds that she estimates earning up to \u00a336,000 over the course of the year for just six appearances per month. Scroll down for video . Jo'Anne Patton, 32, right, works as a Kim Kardashian lookalike - and she's seriously cashing in on her likeness to the reality TV star, left . The lookalike, who currently works as a PA, said: \u2018For some events, for example a teenager having a Sweet Sixteen or another birthday party, then people pay well into the hundreds for a Kim Kardashian appearance because she is their idol. \u2018She\u2019s very popular in that age group because she\u2019s such a good role model\u2019, Miss Patton added. \u2018At the moment I have a full time job and do the Kim Kardashian stuff as a side hobby, but now because there\u2019s the appetite out there for her, it\u2019s something I\u2019d really like to do full time and create a business out of it.\u2019 Jo'Anne has had so much success as a Kim Kardashian lookalike in Leeds that she estimates earning up to \u00a336,000 over the course of the year . The lookalike, who currently works as a PA, only has to put in around six appearances a month . While she only works as Kim's doppleganger part-time, because there's the appetite out there for her, she says it's something she'd really like to do full time and create a business out of it . Kim Kardashian is a 34-year-old American socialite and TV personality who shot to fame after she starred with her family in the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians \u2013 commissioned shortly after a sex tape of her was leaked in 2007. Kardashian is a somewhat controversial celebrity, not least because of her infamous bottom/waist ratio and rumours of cosmetic surgery to enhance her buttocks, which have expanded proportionally with her fame. Nonetheless, she has successfully launched and marketed her own clothing lines, perfume ranges and spin-off shows and Kardashian\u2019s mobile game, in which players can try to become a Hollywood star, was last year\u2019s fifth highest earning game in Apple\u2019s App Store. She has over 27m Twitter followers and 23m Instagram followers and is currently worth around \u00a341m ($64m). Miss Patton, right, says that Kim Kardashian, left, has done really well for herself and has her fingers in a lot of pies and is flattered that some people think she looks like her . Miss Patton says that Kim's profile has become bigger and bigger, adding that it's not just her bum that's made her a household name but her business acumen . The PA admits that keeping up with Kim's appearance costs over \u00a31,300 per month . In October she starred on the cover of Paper magazine wearing nothing but pearls and a smile, revealing her bare buttocks to the world above the headline \u2018Break the Internet\u2019. The following day the magazine released the fully-frontal nude photographs of the shoot, and its website reportedly saw an average of 15.9m views in one day, compared with its usual 25,000. Many have decried Kardashian\u2019s suitability as a 'role model' but Miss Patton said: \u2018Kim Kardashian has done really well for herself and has her fingers in a lot of pies [and] I am flattered that some people think I look like her. \u2018Her profile has become bigger and bigger - not just her bum - and she has been extremely clever in how she\u2019s marketed herself.\u2019 Jo-Anne, left, aged 8 and, right, at school aged 15, says she was bullied over her looks as a youth . Jo-Anne, left, aged 16 and, right, aged 19, says she would consider being a lookalike as her full-time job . Miss Patton works for celebrity lookalikes agencies in Leeds and London, whose clients include banks, magazine and television companies, and large retail stores . She credits her 27-inch waist and 40-inch buttocks to 'a lot of Nandos together with squats and weights' Miss Patton was bullied at school for her looks and said that to be told she looked like Kim Kardashian helped with her confidence levels. \u2018I was more insecure when I was growing up and I was bullied at school\u2019, she said. \u2018I had acne, I wasn\u2019t in with any of the cool crowd.. So it\u2019s flattering if a few years later you put on some make-up and people tell you that you look like Kim Kardashian when you go out.\u2019 Nails - \u00a350 . Hair extensions -\u00a3460 . Tattooed eyeliner - \u00a3450 . Facials - \u00a365 . Fake tan - \u00a320 . Make-up - \u00a350 . Gym membership - \u00a340 . Fake eyelashes - \u00a315 . Clothes - \u00a3200 . Hair, skin and nail supplements - \u00a340 . Total: \u00a31390 . The PA admits that keeping up with Kim\u2019s appearance is no mean feat, and with costs of over \u00a31,300 per month, the look doesn\u2019t come cheap. Despite having breast implants 14 years ago, Miss Patton has had no other cosmetic surgery and says she would not like her bottom to be any bigger. She credits her 27-inch waist and 40-inch buttocks to \u2018a lot of Nandos together with squats and weights in the gym\u2019, and added that: \u2018It\u2019s also important to me that Kim Kardashian is curvy, and is not a skinny role model.\u2019 Two years ago Miss Patton joined celebrity lookalikes agencies in Leeds and London, whose clients include banks, magazine and television companies, and large retail stores. The role of the lookalikes is to 'perform' their character at private parties, conferences, gala dinners and theme nights, as well as mingle with the crowd and have their photograph taken. \u2018My first booking was a private birthday party and I was really nervous\u2019, said Miss Patton. \u2018I wore a tight cream and black body-con Lipsy dress, because Kim likes those dresses, and did my hair and make-up as best I could. \u2018Luckily, the host and all her friends love Kim Kardashian so in the end it was great, as I just smiled and had my picture taken with everyone.\u2019",

        "article": "Tour de France winner Chris Froome has welcomed 24-hour drug testing in cycling. Froome's comments come in the wake of a damning report by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission to address doping in the sport and criticism from Olympic champion Nicole Cooke that the 2013 Tour de France winner was allowed a therapeutic use exemption to compete at the Tour de Romandie last year. 'I for one welcome 24hr testing. It may be an inconvenience but if it can help clean up the sport that I love lets do it,' Froome said on his official Twitter account. Champion cyclist Chris Froome says he would welcome 24hour drug testing in the sport he loves . Froome trains for Team SKY in the mountains of Alcudia, Spain in January . Cooke has called on cycling's governing body, the UCI, to do more to police the 'disturbing grey area' of TUEs and believes Team Sky rider Froome should not have been granted a TUE for a powerful corticosteroid to compete at the 2014 Tour de Romandie after complaining of chest pains. The former Olympic and world road-race champion who retired from cycling two years ago, wrote in The Guardian that UCI president Brian Cookson should apologise to the rest of the riders in the race for failing them. 'I don't think it is at all right that Chris should have the race and prize money taken off him retrospectively, but Cookson needs to issue a very clear message: he should be apologising to the rest of the riders for failing them,' Cooke said. 'That TUE application should not have been approved; Froome and Sky should have had a clear choice of either riding without steroids or pulling out. 'I never found I could be anywhere near the front of a long race when I was ill.' Froome has been criticised for winning the 2014 Tour de Romandie while taking therapeutic drugs . The Sky cyclist's greatest achievement thus far has been winning the 2013 Tour de France . The CIRC report, published on Monday, showed how the culture and previous practices of the UCI allowed Lance Armstrong to cheat, including the retrospective issuing of a TUE to cover up a positive test at the 1999 Tour de France. When the granting of Froome's TUE came to light last June, the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency said procedures had been properly followed. But Cooke feels Cookson should not leave himself open to a situation where he could be accused of favouring a Sky rider - 'the Sky team of which Cookson was a founding board member,' she said. However, Cookson said the rules had subsequently been tightened to ensure all TUE applications went through an independent committee. 'Ms Cooke's accusation is simply wrong,' said Cookson, who since ousting Pat McQuaid as UCI president has overseen the CIRC report that sought to shed light on cycling's darkest days and introduced new anti-doping measures. Former Olympic gold medalist Nicole Cooke has criticised Froome for racing while taking therapeutic drugs . 'I made it a firm pledge that I would separate myself from all anti-doping processes, specifically to avoid any potential conflict of interest, both for me personally and for the UCI in its role as governing body for the sport. 'And I have lived up to that pledge. 'When it came to our attention that we were following an outdated procedure, we looked again at our processes and in order to ensure absolute integrity. 'The UCI confirmed in June 2014 that all TUE decisions must pass through the TUE Committee and be approved by three members unanimously, which is a stronger commitment than what is required by the international standard for therapeutic use exemptions. 'This has added an extra layer of accountability to the decision-making process.'",

Murdered: Edith Sax, 50, a Hosuton nurse whose body was found in her backyard pool in 2014, didn't accidentally drown but was likely murdered, investigators have revealed . Scene: Sax was found floating face down in her pool on April 25, 2014, still wearing her scrubs from work . Spouse: The victim's husband, Steve Sax, a radiologist, has been cleared as a suspect, police say. She had four children and he had three, and they married nine years ago . 'It is clear that the person or persons involved in a relationship with Edith Sax that they knew intricacies in the house and her schedule,' Detective Vashawnda McLean told Click2Houston. A $30,000 reward was offered for information that leads to an arrest in the death. Mrs Sax husband, Steve Sax, whom she married nine years ago, is not a suspect in the murder, police say. Investigators do believe however the killer stand to gain from the substantial inheritance the mother-of-four left. 'I cannot write a huge check into a trust for someone who killed my wife,' Steve Sax told ABC News. Mrs Sax's children are from a previous marriage, while Mr Sax has three children of his own. He said the families quickly blended. 'Edie was the most fierce defender of her children,' he said. 'She loved them utterly.' Overwhelmed: At a press conference in Houston this week, her family, who until recently believed Mrs Sax's death was accidental, appealed for information from the public . Appeal: Mrs Sax's eldest daughter,\u00a0Natasha Rafiq (left), and her husband, Steve Sax (right), both spoke at the press conference. A $30,000 reward is on offer . Investigation: Detective Myron Dillingham revealed at the press conference that Mrs Sax had injuries on her body that suggested she had been held under the water in the pool . Members of Mrs Sax's family appeared at a press conference in Houston this week to plead for help from the public. For months they believed she died accidentally. Two men were said to have been seen leaving the house the day Mrs Sax was found, police now say. 'She didn't deserve this, and we didn't deserve this in the family,'\u00a0Natasha Rafiq, Sax's oldest daughter, said. 'We're lost and we are seeking justice for our mother.' 'I would implore anyone who had any information regarding my mother's murder to come forward and help us have a little bit of peace.' Sax was a nurse practitioner who started her own business, Vanguard Geriatrics, which provided home care to elderly in Texas. Scene: Edith Sax was found dead at her West University Place home on April 25, 2014 .",

        "article": "Students are being targeted on social media by escort agencies offering highly paid work. Freshers on Facebook and Twitter are increasingly being sent messages by groups looking for lap dancers, escorts and 'cam girls'. The adverts come as the average student debt rises to \u00a344,000 following the introduction of \u00a39,000 tuition fees in 2012. Lap dancing can earn students between \u00a350 and \u00a3800 per night, according to research by the University of Leeds. Escorts can earn thousands of pounds per week. Saffron Gold is an escort agency near Manchester. It posted adverts in student groups including \u2018Manchester and Salford University students\u2019 and \u2018University of Manchester \u2013 Freshers 2013/2014\u2019 at the beginning of Freshers' Week . Men are more likely to perform from their bedrooms on webcams, which can earn them up to \u00a3100 per hour,\u00a0The Times reported. Saffron Gold is an escort agency near Manchester. It posted adverts in student groups including\u00a0\u2018Manchester and Salford University students\u2019 and \u2018University of Manchester \u2013 Freshers 2013/2014\u2019 at the beginning of Freshers' Week. The agency, which has a profile picture reading 'keep calm and book an escort',\u00a0described their roles as flexible and said it was looking for 'attractive, charming ladies aged between 18 and 40 with good figures and great personalities'. It added: 'We are happy for ladies with different profiles to apply for our escort vacancies because all our clients are not the same and they have different needs and preferences.' In an earlier advert Saffron Gold wrote it was looking for 'new and experienced' girls. Twitter users in East Anglia were also targeted by an agency that sent dozens of messages urging students to join them. Anglian Escorts followed thousands of students in 2012 in the hope they would see its recruitment adverts. The life of an escort was made public by Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour' Its account was suspended - but it has since been reactivated and hundreds of messages are sent every day. In one Tweet the agency wrote: 'Looking to employ #escorts in East Anglia apply here! Premium escort agency.' A report completed at the University of Leeds found that club managers also deliberately put flyers out in Freshers' Week urging students to join. It said: 'A club manager in a northern city site explained how he always put flyers out at Freshers' Week inviting female students to audition.' London-based agency Haute Girls specifically advertises having students on its books. It states on its website: 'Faced with the options of poorly paid term time jobs and more lucrative escorting, a cash-strapped London student may turn to the later, especially when escorting gives them the extra time and flexibility to study.' The life of an escort was made public by Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour'. Her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in London and working as call girl to fund her studies. Laura Watson, a spokesman for the English Collective of Prostitutes, said they mostly deal with female students on their hotlines. She said: 'From a student perspective there has definitely been an increase in calls to our helpline since loans were brought in.' Academics at Swansea University will release a report on the extent of students turning to the sex industry next week.",

        "article": "More than any other telescope in orbit, Hubble has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge. For 25 years, astronomers have used it to peer deep into distant galaxies with unrivalled clarity, revealing the breathtaking beauty of our universe. In the April issue of National Geographic, some of the most stunning images beamed back for the telescope have been revealed. The Horsehead Nebula is a cold, dark cloud of gas and dust, silhouetted against the bright nebula IC 434. The bright area at the top left edge is a young star still embedded in its nursery of gas and dust.\u00a0The nebula is relatively close at 1,500 light years from Earth . Hubble has helped scientists understand how planets and galaxies form, detected black holes and changed our theories surrounding dark energy, a mysterious force that causes the universe to expand faster and faster as time goes on. The hundreds of thousands of images beamed back from Hubble have helped scientists unravel cosmic mysteries as well as estimate the age of the universe to about 14 billion years old. Among them is the Horsehead Nebula - a cold, dark cloud of gas and dust, silhouetted against the bright nebula IC 434 1,500 light years from Earth. Another remarkable image shows a display of starlight, glowing gas, and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust that forms the spiral galaxy NGC 130. This is one of Hubble's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy. Some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate-mass stars, when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space. In 2002, a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our sun, temporarily making it the brightest star in the Milky Way. The mysterious star, called V838 Monocerotis, has since faded back to obscurity. But observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of a phenomenon called a 'light echo' around the star have uncovered remarkable new features . This huge, young stellar grouping, called R136, is only a few million years old and resides in the 30 Doradus Nebula, a turbulent star-birth region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way . The telescope captured a display of starlight, glowing gas, and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4-foot-by-8-foot image of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 130.\u00a0This is one of Hubble's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy . 'Launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, amid flurries of hope and hype, the Hubble Space Telescope promptly faltered,' explained Timothy Ferris writing in April's issue of National Geographic . An iconic image from Hubble captures the dying breaths from planetary nebula NGC 6302. Known perhaps more appropriately as the Bug or Butterfly Nebula, this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light-years away from us within the Milky Way. But at first, astronomers didn't expect Hubble to amount to much. 'Launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, amid flurries of hope and hype, the Hubble Space Telescope promptly faltered,' explained Timothy Ferris writing in April's issue of\u00a0National Geographic. 'Rather than remaining locked on its celestial targets, it trembled and shook, quaking like a photophobic vampire whenever sunlight struck its solar panels. 'Opening its protective front door to let starlight in perturbed the telescope so badly that it fell into an electronic coma. 'Worst of all, Hubble turned out to be myopic. Its primary light-gathering mirror, eight feet in diameter and said to be the smoothest large object ever fashioned by humans, had been figured perfectly wrong.' The telescope's design had been a compromise. While astronomers had wanted a bigger telescope in a higher orbit, they could only get 350 miles (550km) high so that astronauts in space could reach it for repairs. Next month, the telescope - which is the length of a large school bus and weighs as much as two adult elephants - will celebrate its 25th anniversary. To celebrate Hubble astronomers recently revisited one of its most stunning photos to date, known as 'the pillars of creation.' Taken in 1995, the team revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16. The new Hubble photo is sharper than the original, and also has a\u00a0 wider field of view.\u00a0It also reveals the base of the cold, gassy columns for the first time. And in January the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the Andromeda Galaxy - the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way. The Hubble image shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy\u2019s pancake-shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light-years. The sweeping view, which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour, also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago. The panoramic image has 1.5 billion pixels \u2014 meaning you would need more than 600 HD television screens to display the whole image. It traces the galaxy from its central galactic bulge on the left, where stars are densely packed together, across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outskirts of its outer disc on the right. 'That human beings find them to be as beautiful and evocative as photos of earthly sunsets and mountain peaks affirms anew that nature is all of a piece, and that we're part of it,' said Ferris. Some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate-mass stars, when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space.

        "article": "Would you reveal your biggest regret in the name of art? A young Romanian photographer took to the streets of  the UK and Romania to find strangers brave enough to confess their deepest, darkest secrets on camera. Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi, 22, from London, captured people of all ages  in various locations  in a bid to explore ideas of human interaction and communication. A new photo project shows people holding their regrets on handwritten signs. This woman's deepest regret was when she stole her sister's money . The girl on the left wrote: 'I regret that I forgot to take my baby doll with me today' and the boy (right) wrote\u00a0'I regret I do not have more time to play' Standing straight clutching holding their signs, the unnamed subjects stare straight into the University of Portsmouth graduate's lens, allowing viewers to judge them and draw their own conclusions. While some declared they had no regrets, others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state. Alcohol addiction, theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves. A young man with a smiling toddler in a pram confessed his drinking problem while a teenage wears the ghost of a smile as she admits stealing her sister's money. A couple now living in a British seaside town said: 'Our biggest regret is that we didn't move here many years ago. WE LOVE IT HERE' These young men regret supporting Middlesbrough and smoking cannabis . A remorseful woman regretted not being able to help her child more and another wished she had different parents. There were positive messages too though, with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live, while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her. Alecsandra said of the project: 'This question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor, thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years.' The girl on the left wrote 'Not having the confidence to be the best I can' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote\u00a0'What I did last night' This man regrets: 'Not saying \"I love you!\" enough' But while many people Alecsandra asked were happy to open up about their experiences, others flatly refused. She said: 'It is true that many of the surveyed people had some abstention regarding their answers, and some of them said that it is too personal, but I had the chance to meet kind people to whom I could talk.' The project was inspired by the work of Gillian Wearing, OBE, an English conceptual artist who was part of the Young British Artists' movement in the 1990s. Wearing uses photography and video to document the confessions of ordinary\u00a0people and won the Turner Prize in 1997 for her '60 Minutes Silence' and 'Sacha And Mum' videos. This woman revealed that she regretted: 'That I did not have the right parents' The man with the pram on the left confessed 'Developing an addiction to alcohol' and the man on the right wrote 'Not becoming a footballer' Alecsandra believes that her project had the power to help the people she met, by helping them to offload their burdens. She said: 'I think that frequently when you share your thought with somebody, even if it is strange person, you release the black stain which is on the soul and you can feel free. 'I do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets. 'In my opinion, there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them. 'Not thinking about regrets is better, because what you have done is in the past.' Submit your own regrets into the project here, or view the entire photo series on\u00a0Alecsandra's\u00a0website. This woman said: 'I regret I could not help my child more' This woman regrets not having enough courage . Although this man taking part in the photography project said he had no regrets .

        "article": "(CNN)Could mobile technology turn the tide in the fight to eliminate racism from football? Anti-racism organization Kick It Out (KIO) says there's been a 35% rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that's largely due to a new phone app. \"The app has had a massive impact,\" KIO media and communications manager Richard Bates told CNN, noting that it accounted for 27% of all complaints. \"Self-policing is so important when it comes to stamping out racism in football. People are confident that their complaints will be taken seriously.\" The 184 reported incidents recorded during the last five months of 2014 covered racial and religious discrimination, as well as sexual orientation, gender and disability offenses. The increase was measured against the same period the year before. KIO's mobile phone application, which was released in 2013, encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a \"Report It!\" tab and entering the name of the football ground, positioning of the offender, and incident details. Although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested, KIO emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key. Every single objection logged by fans, either on the phone, via email, or on the app, triggers an investigation by the English Football Association (FA). These include 73 incidents on social media (a 24% increase), which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified, and at times having their accounts deleted. The FA, which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013, encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents. \"Reporting abuse, whether witnessed or experienced, is an important part of the game's overall anti-discrimination work,\" said an FA spokesperson. \"There are clear ways for players and fans to do this, and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future.\" Bates admitted that it takes \"bravery and courage\" for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones, but pointed to the effect British expatriate Paul Nolan has had after he filmed Chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the Paris metro last month. The amateur video obtained by The Guardian newspaper, and posted on its website, shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station, only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers. The Chelsea fans can then be heard chanting: \"We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.\" Chelsea were in France to play Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League first-leg tie - Europe's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1. Five people have been identified and suspended by Chelsea, who have launched an ongoing investigation. Later in February, KIO says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men, thought to be West Ham fans, singing anti-Semitic songs on a train while traveling to Tottenham Hotspur's White Hart Lane ground ahead of an English Premier League game. \"Would we know that these Paris and London incidents had happened if they weren't on video?\" Bates asks, adding that KIO is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app. \"If you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively, it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators,\" he says. In a report released in 2013 entitled \"English Football's Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan\", the FA explicitly talks about \"raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level.\" KIO's jurisdiction extends to all of English football, including the amateur ranks. It is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which solicits complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior. It also polices the actions of players, which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past. In 2012, Rio Ferdinand refused to wear a KIO T-shirt before a match while playing for Manchester United. He was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against John Terry after the Chelsea defender was accused of racially abusing his brother, Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers. Terry was banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000 by the FA for his actions.",

        "article": "According to the fashion world, the Seventies are back \u2014 and there\u2019s no one happier about it than me, as someone who lived and breathed every second of it. Designers such as Prada, Tom Ford and Gucci showered catwalks last year in flares, jumpsuits, wide-brimmed hats and wild prints. But the retro revival doesn\u2019t stop at the ankles; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every High Street in the country. As a top model during the Seventies, I lived in platforms. Bigger was always better, especially because \u2014 at 5 ft 8 in \u2014 I was a little on the short side for the fashion world. Scroll down for video . As a top model during the Seventies, Jilly Johnson (pictured in early Seventies) spent a lot of time wearing platform shoes . I had to bluff my way through shoots with billowing bell-bottoms and chunky shoes that looked fun, flirty and fabulous. But now, aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren, I\u2019m not sure I can carry them off with such aplomb. Surely thin, slimming lines and elegant shapes are what I\u2019m after rather than weighty clodhoppers? To find out if they can ever be flattering, I put eight pairs through their paces. Kurt Geiger, \u00a3130 . Shoes: www.kurtgeiger.com . Completely inappropriate \u2014 but I think these are divine. I had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by Terry de Havilland like these more than 40 years ago. Sadly, those days are gone. No one over 30 should attempt these now. At 6 in, they are impossible to walk in, though the colour is fabulous. I\u2019d call these ankle breakers. Height: 6 in . Wearability: 3/10 . Clarks, \u00a3150 . Shoes: www.clarks.co.uk . Help! These look like dumb-bells stuck to my feet. They are out of proportion with my legs. I look absurd. Not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them. No thank you. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 0/10 . Next, \u00a335 . Shoes: www.next.co.uk . These work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge. They would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly. I\u2019d buy them in a heartbeat. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 9/10 . Russell & Bromley, \u00a3125 . Shoes: www.russellandbromley.co.uk . These are reminiscent of my Seventies \u2018peace, love and brown rice\u2019 days. The clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s. I clumped about as though walking on stilts. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 2/10 . Dune, \u00a379 . Shoes: www.dunelondon.com . My absolute favourites: the front platform (about an inch thick) is just enough to boost your height without looking clunky. Orange is a bright and breezy colour for spring and summer. Height: 4.5 in . Wearability: 10/10 . Zara, \u00a349.99 . Shoes: www.zara.com . I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I love these skyscrapers. Forty years ago, I would have practically slept in them. Padded soles and thick ankle straps mean they are surprisingly comfortable. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 6/10 . Topshop, \u00a355 . Shoes: www.topshop.com . From the knees down I look great, but I\u2019m not sure a 61-year-old can get away with these. They are as subtle as a sledgehammer and too cumbersome in heavy looking black. Height: 5\u00bd in . Wearability: 6/10 . Office, \u00a365 . Shoes: www.office.co.uk . One of the sturdiest pair of heels I\u2019ve ever worn. The soft leather and mule style is spot-on Seventies. The open toe is perfect for summer and these are age appropriate, too. Hallelujah! Height: 4 in . Wearability: 10/10 .",

As many as 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese since 2011, according to shocking figures from a series of Freedom of Information requests. At just one trust nearly 400 babies born in the last four years weighed 9lb 15oz or more - the marker for an obese baby. Hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year including some weighing more than a stone, Freedom of Information requests have revealed (stock image) Peterborough and Stamford \u00adHospitals Trust also recorded 280 exceptionally large babies and another 265 arrived at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Warwickshire. There has also been an increase in the number of babies weighing 12lb or more. Seven clinics reported births of so-called 'sumo babies' in 2013 - including two where the babies weighed more than a stone. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing. 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight. 'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is  a continuous upwards spiral. Danica Slavin (second from right) gave birth to two babies, Eva (right) and Jack (left), who both weighed over 10lbs. They had to be delivered via caesarean at Jessop Wing maternity unit in Sheffield but are now happy and healthy . Eva (above) was born in 2013 and weighed 12lb 6oz - 5lb more than the average baby girl . One mother has given birth to two big babies in the last 18 months. Danica Slavin had her first daughter Eva Lily Margerrison in 2013 and was shocked when she weighed in at 12lb 6oz. But she was even more surprised when three weeks ago she gave birth to her son Jack, who, at 10lb 3oz, was nearly just as big. Both babies had to be delivered via caesarean at Jessop Wing maternity unit. The 21-year-old mother, from Sheffield, met her partner Sam Margerrison four years ago when they worked at fast-food chain Burger King. She said: 'I don't know why Eva and Jack were so big because me and my partner Sam weren't big babies. 'I was tested for gestational diabetes with both babies but that was ruled out. 'I just had big babies.' She explained that Jack was currently on formula and Eva enjoyed her fruit and vegetables. She also dismissed claims that the size of a baby at birth related to its parents. 'You obviously don't expect a baby of that size,' she said. 'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies. He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally. 'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' Toddlers are also being hospitalised for being obese, with 28 two-year-olds and 33 three-year-olds admitted since 2011, Laura Connor revealed in her\u00a0Sunday Mirror\u00a0investigation. Freedom of Information requests were sent to 153 hospital trusts in the country and received 110 replies. Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust - 372 . Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals Trust - 280 . George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust - 265 . Bedford Hospital NHS Trust - 220 . London North West Healthcare NHS Trust - 165 . The average weight of a baby boy is 7lb 8oz and for a girl it is 7lb 4oz. Childhood obesity can lead to a number of medical problems including diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer. A Royal College of Midwives spokesman said: 'It starts pre-conceptually. If a woman is trying to get pregnant then she should already be eating healthily and not drinking or smoking. 'It is a common myth that the woman should eat for two. Really, she should be just taking in lots of vegetables and a balanced diet. 'Long walks and gentle jogs can also help.' Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight'",

Preliminary information indicates the explosion at Zasyadko mine was caused by methane gas, according to DAN, the official news agency for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). \"This did not happen because of shelling,\" an emergency services official told the news agency. The explosion occurred just before 6 a.m. local time, when 230 people were at the mine, the official website for separatist-controlled Donetsk city said. Of those, 157 were evacuated in the initial hours after the blast, including 14 injured and one dead, according to the website. Fifteen rescue teams are working at the scene, it said. Zasyadko mine is one of the most dangerous in terms of methane in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform, which reported that 240 people had died at the mine since 1999 -- 101 miners were killed in a single accident in 2007. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, accused the pro-Russian separatists who control the area of denying Ukrainian rescue teams access to the site, Ukrinform reported. He urged Russia to tell the separatists to allow in the rescue workers. \"You took millions of Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk hostage and are now brutalizing miners' families by not letting in help,\" Ukrinform quoted him as saying. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also called for rescuers to be allowed in. \"I demand Ukrainian rescue workers and investigators to be granted access at the site of the tragedy,\" he tweeted. However, DPR representative Denis Pushilin said Ukraine had not offered help with the rescue, and the DPR will ask Russia or separatist authorities in Luhansk for help if needed, according to the separatists' news agency. Separatist leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko issued an order to close the mine a month ago, but managers ignored the order because the mine legally belongs to Ukraine, Ukrinform cited the separatist news agency as saying. A shaky ceasefire is currently in place in Donetsk and the neighboring Luhansk region, the center of a months-long conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

A British tourist struck down by 'the bends' on a scuba diving trip in the Maldives died after it took nine hours to get her to a decompression chamber. An inquest heard Melanie Stoddart, 38, died of decompression sickness shortly after arriving in the Indian Ocean island for a 12-day holiday with her boyfriend. There was a delay in Ms Stoddart receiving medical help because there was initially no boat or plane to take her to hospital. And upon her arrival at hospital, medics did not even treat her for decompression sickness, the inquest into her death was told. Her parents, Peter, 68, and Irene, 64, slammed the 'sheer incompetence' of the authorities in the Maldives and warned other tourists to 'take note' before booking a similar trip. The inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver from Prestwich in Greater Manchester, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year. On the third day of her organised trip, she was in a party of 12 holidaymakers and two instructors who went to Vaavu Atoll for the last scuba dive of the day just after 3pm. The inquest was told she returned to the surface after about 30 minutes and asked for medical help as she was feeling unwell. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort nearby. When it became clear her condition was deteriorating the resort's doctor said she needed to be taken to a decompression chamber, but there was no transport available. A speed boat only arrived from neighbouring Bandos Island, more than 40 miles away, when insurance checks had been carried out. A doctor sedated Ms Stoddart, but decided she was not stable enough to be put in a decompression chamber. She was then transferred for a second time by boat six miles to the capital of Male where CT scans of her head and chest were taken at the ADK Hospital. But at 2.15am the next morning she went into cardiac arrest and died half an hour later. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort (pictured) nearby . The court heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year . Initially a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and it took specialist tests carried out on samples of brain tissue to detect\u00a0damage caused by nitrogen bubbles being present in her blood stream. Divers' disease, or 'the bends', is a condition caused from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. Consultant Pathologist Dr Andrew Hitchcock told the hearing that the minute damage caused by the bubbles and a ruptured left ear drum suggested Ms Stoddart had  decompression syndrome. Her father, Peter Stoddart, of Holmeswood, Derbyshire, told the court his daughter was a qualified diving instructor and member of a club who had dived all over the world. 'Nothing was too much for her, she never failed and was never fazed,' he said. He said the family had spotted 'discrepancies' in the reports from police and tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide which raised serious questions about the safety procedures in place. 'It's my opinion there were no proper safety procedures in place on these islands,' he said. 'For a people and a country that relies on diving for its main income I would assume there would have been. 'The time lapse was nine hours and that is just not acceptable,' he added. 'If she had been in a chamber within an hour she would have been stable enough to deal with it.' Melanie Stoddart was diving from the MV Sea Spirit (pictured) in the Maldives when she was taken ill . The ADK Hospital in the Maldives capital of Male where Ms Stoddart died in the early hours on April 4, 2012 . Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Paul McCandless said: 'Melanie was a practiced and experienced sea diver who took unwell on a dive. Due to a lack of appropriate transport at that time of day there was a delay in taking her to an appropriate facility. 'Once there, there was a partial misdiagnosis that she was not suffering from compression sickness. She was deemed to be too unwell to go into the chamber and was transferred to hospital . 'It is possible that if her condition had been diagnosed sooner that she would not have died when she did.' He added: 'Holidaymakers need to be aware of what emergency procedures are in place should any particular difficulties arise.' After the hearing Melanie's mother Irene, 64, said: 'My daughter's death was down to sheer incompetence. She received no treatment for nine hours, how can that be right?' MailOnline has contacted tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide for a comment.",

        "article": "The College of Policing have conducted a study into chief officer misconduct (file picture) Police chiefs put gifts for their lovers on taxpayer-funded expenses and preyed on young female colleagues out of arrogance, a scathing report has found. They saw themselves as captains of industry rather than public servants, research into a string of misconduct scandals concluded. A culture of entitlement meant some in the highest ranks believed they had a right to perks and privileges including gym membership, school fees, overseas travel, hospitality and executive cars. The report added that too many forces tolerated bullying with a \u2018boys club\u2019 culture that allowed misconduct to thrive. It was compiled as part of a College of Policing drive to improve leadership and integrity within the 43 constabularies in England and Wales. Academics studied the cases of 33 police chiefs, all assistant chief constables or above, who were investigated for, or guilty of, offences including financial misconduct, dishonesty, bullying, racism and sexism since 2008. Although not named in the report, one is understood to be Terry Grange, the then chief constable of Dyfed-Powys Police who used his corporate credit card to pay for meals with his mistress and exchanged politically insensitive and sexually explicit emails with her via the force computer system. In 2008, the Independent Police Complaints Commission upheld the allegations it investigated. Mr Grange did not face disciplinary action because he had already retired. In October 2012 Sean Price, of Cleveland Police, was the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years for gross misconduct after he lied to the police watchdog and ordered a member of staff to do the same. Experts commissioned by the College of Policing, a professional body for police in England and Wales, studied misconduct investigations triggered by complaints about professional conduct made by spouses or partners when the relationship collapsed. Other cases studied included internal probes over expenses incurred while officers conducted affairs, and inappropriate and potentially predatory sexual conduct towards junior colleagues. The study carried out by the College of Policing was described as the first step towards understanding how police leaders can get drawn into misconduct . Police chiefs were also investigated for misconduct over pay, perks, hospitality, travel and expenses, racism, sexism, dishonesty and abuses of their force\u2019s recruitment and procurement processes. One senior officer was given an executive car fitted with blue lights and sirens, even though not trained to use it, because emergency vehicles received tax breaks. The report found: \u2018It was clear in a number of cases that there were factors specific to particular chief officers that appeared to be relevant to their behaviour. [They had] individual weaknesses that were regarded as risk factors. Some [interviewees] suggested that arrogance is a corollary of decisiveness, which is considered a desirable and necessary attribute in chief officers.\u2019 The academics, who interviewed nearly 40 senior police officers and investigators, found that despite cuts of millions of pounds from police budgets, senior officers retained a culture of entitlement towards taxpayer-funded perks. It said: \u2018Some chief officers tended to see themselves as being more akin to \u201ccaptains of industry\u201d than public servants \u2013 with all the entitlements and privileges that came with the CEO role. \u2018Several interviewees described a \u2018\u2018culture of entitlement\u201d at chief officer level. A culture of entitlement among some leaders had become ingrained to an extent that rendered it impervious to the changing ethical landscape associated with austerity.\u2019 Sean Price, former chief constable of Cleveland Police, left, and Grahame Maxwell, former chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, right, were at the centre of misconduct investigations . The College of Policing has a number of offices including one in London, on the 11th floor of this building . It found chief officers operated in a \u2018distinctive environment that presents considerable risks, pressures and temptations\u2019. They were powerful police officers, who were often isolated and unchallenged by less senior officers. Part of the problem was that challenging a senior officer\u2019s judgement was \u2018widely considered to be career-limiting\u2019. But the report said there were encouraging signs police chiefs were shifting to more inclusive and open leadership styles, which was less likely to lead to corruption within forces.",

MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged. Police and prosecutors have been criticised for arresting journalists on suspicion of a range of offences in the wake of phone-hacking allegations, rather than concentrating on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud. MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders (pictured) of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged . An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost \u00a333.5million up to the end of September 2014. Since 2011, 64 journalists have been arrested but only ten convicted, four of them being jailed. One has accepted a caution and seven have been acquitted.

        "article": "Almost half of savers who chose to cash in their pensions as part of the biggest reforms in a century will be making an 'irrational decision', according a financial watchdog. On April 6, over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension, rather than being forced to buy a guaranteed monthly income for life. The Treasury has pledged to offer appointments to help them decide what to do with their money. Next month over-55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension - but experts are predicting chaos when the changes come in as the Treasury advice service is not yet up and running . However, the Financial Conduct Authority is warning that up to 40 per cent of savers who cash in their pensions will be 'irreversibly worse off'. And in some cases they even say people who cash in will be left destitute as they enter old age. Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, told the Telegraph: 'In many cases it may not be in the member's best interests. 'We need to ensure that those who are considering it are fully aware of the potential benefits they are giving up.' The warning comes amid concern that some savers still cannot book an appointment with the Government\u2019s pension guidance service \u2013 despite just one month to go before the reforms. Insurance firms say they are being contacted by floods of frustrated customers who are unable to even book a face-to-face or telephone appointment . Experts are predicting chaos when the changes come in, with the \u2018Pension Wise\u2019 service still without a telephone number or booking service. Insurance firms say they are being contacted by floods of frustrated customers who are unable to even book a face-to-face or telephone appointment . Richard Jones, of Scottish Widows, said: \u2018I am concerned the Government is over-reliant on its website. Many people will want face-to-face or telephone guidance. \u2018I am worried they are not going to be able to cope with the initial surge. \u2018We have had customers calling since the start of the year who want to talk to the Government about what they want to do in April but they can\u2019t. Thousands of customers who are trying to figure out what to do and cannot even book an appointment yet.\u2019 Scottish Widows, which corners 10 per cent of the retirement market, has recruited an extra 400 staff to deal with queries about the pension reforms and expressed their dismay that the Government had hired fewer than that themselves. Only 300 official experts will be on hand to help hundreds of thousands of savers make the right decisions about their pensions when major reforms kick in. Many will have little or no previous expertise in pensions, which could lead to huge delays and many missing out on proper guidance. Job adverts being placed by Citizen\u2019s Advice have revealed that, while it essential that applicants have good numerical and communication skills, no pensions knowledge is required.",

A defence chief is to become the highest paid Whitehall civil servant after he was awarded a lucrative pay package to sort out botched reforms. Tony Douglas, who will be in charge of the department\u2019s equipment programme, is to be given a \u00a3285,000 salary and a \u00a3250,000 performance-related annual bonus, it has been revealed. His basic salary \u2013 double what the Prime Minister earns \u2013 is 25 per cent more than that of Bernard Gray, the man he will succeed. It is nearly three times a brigadier\u2019s \u00a3103,166 salary and 15 times a regular soldier\u2019s pay of \u00a317,945. The fatcat deal comes as 22,000 troops have been axed, along with warships, fighter jets and tanks, under an Armed Forces shake-up. Analysts warn of further devastating cuts to come. Andy Silvester, campaign director at the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018If there isn\u2019t a dramatic improvement, taxpayers will be rightly furious at the size of this pay packet. 'As in every part of the public sector, his performance in the job must be open to public scrutiny, and any bonuses awarded must be truly earned.\u2019 The Ministry of Defence announced the appointment of Mr Douglas, currently chief executive of Abu Dhabi Airports, on Wednesday. He will start in September and is the latest in a line of senior business figures lured into the public sector with the promise of private sector levels of pay. In a statement released by the MoD, Mr Douglas said he would take pride in providing \u2018utmost service quality\u2019 and \u2018value to the taxpayer\u2019. He will take over from Mr Gray, who provoked a furore when he charged the taxpayer \u00a323,000 for luxury hotel stays in his first ten months in the job \u2013 at a time when his department faced huge budget cuts. He then faced calls to resign after he failed in his efforts to part-privatise the way the MoD buys defence equipment, costing taxpayers millions of pounds. Mr Douglas's salary will be double that of the Prime Minister, three times that of a brigadier, on \u00a3103,166, and\u00a015 times a regular soldier\u2019s pay of \u00a317,945 (file image) Mr Gray, a former Labour adviser and businessman who had been appointed to help bring down the military budget, saw his total pay deal rocket to \u00a3385,000 last year. The figure \u2013 which included his total pay and perks \u2013 was up 30 per cent on the previous year. He will remain on a basic salary of between \u00a3220,000 and \u00a3224,999 for the rest of his tenure this year \u2013 and his performance-related bonus could be the same again, or even higher. Appointed in December 2010, Mr Gray was in charge of part-privatising the agency which buys all forces\u2019 kit from pots and pans to fighter jets, but all the bidders pulled out. It was revealed in 2012 that he spent \u00a323,000 on 106 overnight stays at hotels in London and Bristol during his first ten months even though his home was a 60-mile drive from his offices in Whitehall and the equipment arm of the MoD in Bristol. He also had access to a taxpayer-funded official car and driver worth \u00a349,000. Official figures revealed last year that more than 85 MoD staff earn over \u00a3100,000 a year.",

        "article": "An 800lb man, whose depression and size once brought him to the brink of suicide, vowed to lose 150lbs in order to qualify for the weight loss surgery needed to save his life after a series of dangerous falls sent him to the hospital 10 times in nine months. When Joe Wexler, 31, first joined TLC's obesity series My 600lbs Life, he was using food as an emotional crutch and consuming roughly 10,000 calories a day. And on last night's episode of the series, a weight loss specialist insisted that, if Joe had to get down to 650lbs, he would be unable to undergo the live-saving surgery he so desperately needed. But despite making the life-changing decision to move from Johnson City, Tennessee, to Houston, Texas, to be close to Dr Younan Nowzaradan, Joe struggled to shed the necessary weight - and actually managed to gain a further 15lbs in just one month. Scroll down for video . No hope: Joe Wexler, 31, can be seen calling an ambulance after he fell at his home in\u00a0Johnson City, Tennessee. \u00a0At nearly 800lbs, he was unable to get up by himself . Team work: It took multiple emergency technicians to lift Joe off of the floor to take him to the hospital . 'I'm mad at myself,' Joe said tearfully. 'Not only did I not lose, but I gained. I am really scared.' During his appointment, Dr Nowzaradan attempted to address his patient's weight gain - however Joe continued to make excuses for his failure to follow orders. He blamed being on the road during the move to Houston, noting that he was forced to eat fast-food at convenient stores and rest stops. Joe alleged that he ate two grilled chicken sandwiches a day, but\u00a0Dr Nowzaradan told him that his claims were mathematically impossible. 'Joe is still in denial about how much he is eating,' Dr Nowzaradan explained. 'He is still eating just as much, if not more.' He told his patient that he was on 'borrowed time' and 'spiraling out of control'. 'At this rate every day is a question as to whether he is going to make it,' Dr Nowzaradan said. 'Any number of things could [become] a deadly situation with him.' Daily chore: Joe can be seen getting dressed after bathing himself. He said he would rather die than have someone have to do that for him . Best friends: Joe's sister Annie came to visit him and make him lunch . Feeling lost: Annie cried while explaining that she felt unable to really help her brother . Fearing for Joe's safety, Dr Nowzaradan sent him for testing to ensure he was even healthy enough to return to his own home. And after Joe was cleared to leave his doctor's office, he was appointed a nutritionist to help him get his eating under control. During their first meeting, Joe admitted to her that his 'greatest struggle with food is emotional eating'. 'If I feel bad, I go to it,' he said. One of Joe's biggest emotional hardships was feeling rejected by his father. Joe had always struggled with his weight. As a child he longed for his father's attention, but his dad chose to shower him with gifts instead of his love. 'I would have given up every one of those things that I had if he would have paid me any attention,' Joe said. Smiling child: Joe said he was always chunky, noting that he struggled with his weight his entire life . Strained relationship: As a child, Joe longed for his father's attention, but he was given material items instead of affection . Slippery slope: Joe said he eats to deal with his feelings and his father's rejection . His sister Annie noted that he had always been big, but when their parents divorced his weight 'spiraled out of control'. 'If there was some way to fix him myself, I would,' she said tearfully. Joe explained that he had free reign to do whatever he wanted when was younger - and that included eating whatever he wanted. After hitting 777lbs, Joe was unable to walk without falling and his mom said his 'spirit had been broken'. At the start of the episode, he was forced to call an ambulance after his legs gave out and he had fallen to the floor. 'I feel like a prisoner inside this body,' Joe said. 'I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. When I fall I can't just get up on my own, so I have to call an ambulance. It's really embarrassing.' He used to work an I.T. job from home, but after his company told him he had to return to the office or he would lose his job, he was left unemployed. Huge shock: During his visit to weight loss surgeon\u00a0Dr Nowzaradan's office in Houston, Texas, Joe was sad to learn that he weighed 777lbs . Big goal: Dr Nowzaradan told Joe and his mother Robin that he needed to get down to 650lbs to be a candidate for gastric bypass surgery . Helping hand: After gaining 15lbs,\u00a0Dr Nowzaradan had Joe meet with a nutritionist who taught him how to read food labels properly . Joe had become a recluse and the only thing he was able to do on his own was bathe himself. 'I refuse to let anyone bathe me,' he said. 'It is the only thing I won't allow,' He added: 'I would rather die than make someone have to do that for me.' Joe admitted that he once considered killing himself after he saw a television program about a morbidly obese man who had died because of his weight. 'I was looking around trying to find some way to off myself,' he said. 'I kept thinking it would be better for everybody. I didn't care anymore.' After meeting with his nutritionist, Joe knew he was 'as good as dead' if he failed to lose weight. And slowly but surely he started to drop the pounds. His next appointment with\u00a0Dr Nowzaradan showed that he lost 71lbs. Support system: Joe, who has had suicidal thoughts because of his size, met with a therapist to deal with his inner turmoil . Work it out: Joe also hired a trainer and visited the gym for the first time in his life . Although Joe was pleasantly surprised, he was reminded that he still had a long way to go in order to get down to 650lbs. He decided to keeping seeing a therapist in order to gain control of his emotional eating. 'A lot of stuff is coming up to the surface, and it is hard not to get depressed,' Joe explained. 'Last time I got this depressed I thought about hurting myself, and I don't want to end up in a place that dark again.' He added: 'I think about dying and leaving my mother and my sister behind and I refuse to do that to them. I refuse to let them bury me.' Joe, who has a habit of eating his feelings, said it was really good to talk to his therapist because it was something he had never done before. He also took the initiative to meet with a trainer and go to the gym for the first time in his life. 'I have faith that I am going to be able to do this,' he said. 'I just have to stick with it and keep fighting.' Major milestone: Joe was able to get down to 652lbs and was later approved for weight loss surgery . Next step: Dr Nowzaradan can be seen operating on Joe during his gastric bypass procedure . Fresh start: Joe happily walked out of the hospital after learning that he had lost 200lbs since the start of his journey . Because of his new found resolve to lose weight, he stopped asking his mother for food and started cooking himself healthier meals. He noted: 'Food is killing me when it should be doing the opposite of that, so I am trying to eat even healthier.' And his hard work paid off. The next time he met with\u00a0Dr Nowzaradan he weighed 652lbs. The doctor scheduled his gastric bypass for the following week. 'If I could jump up and down for joy, I would right now,' Joe said. 'I am as happy as can be.' His mom cried tears of joy when she learned the news. Dr Nowzaradan reduced Joe's stomach size by 80per cent during the surgery. A week later, it was revealed that Joe lost even more weight and was down to 592lbs. 'I finally get to put to rest the curse that has followed me around since I was two years old,' he said. 'This begins the new chapter, and I can't wait to see where the book leads.'",

An art gallery manager sold a customer\u2019s \u00a35,000 painting to somebody else by mistake \u2013 before commissioning an \u2018ugly copy\u2019 to try to con its owner. The Envie d\u2019art gallery, in South Kensington, London, had been asked to look after the painting while the home of the customer who purchased it was undergoing renovations. But when the art lover asked for it to be delivered three years later, the gallery gave him an apparent imitation - and then tried to convince him it was his original. The Evening Standard reports that gallery manager Geraldine Hassler had mistakenly sold the painting while they were storing it for the customer. The newspaper quotes a source as saying that the gallery initially said it was having trouble locating the painting and asked the customer whether he had a picture of the artwork to help them trace it. He did not have an image \u2013 but weeks later he was informed it had been found in Envie d\u2019art\u2019s Paris gallery. Once it had been picked up in London, the customer spotted differences and asked if the artist had carried out any extra work on the painting. After being told this had not happened, he took his purchase home, only to find that the artist\u2019s signature was dated three years after he bought it. The Evening Standard quotes the source as saying that the customer eventually found an email picture of his original and saw that he had been given a \u2018rather ugly copy\u2019. The source said the gallery manager had \u2018panicked\u2019 when the customer asked for his painting back and ordered a new commission that was \u2018in the spirit\u2019 of the original \u2018for a new client\u2019. After being threatened with legal action, the gallery eventually admitted its error.

Howard Dixon, who has served students his famous chili dogs and burgers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for 15 years, is now unemployed after the university closed the fraternity with immediate effect. It comes after members were filmed chanting 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' to the tune of 'If You're Happy And You Know It'. 'I think that was kind of stupid and selfish for them to do something like that,' Howard told CBS. 'And knowing this was an organization supposed to be about brotherhood - that wasn't no brotherhood.' Scroll down for video . Out of a job: Howard Dixon, the chef for Oklahoma University's disgraced fraternity, has said he will miss the job and his 'family'. He is pictured moving out of the fraternity house on Tuesday . Moving out: He was seen removing items and loading up his car outside the frat house in Norman on Tuesday . Packing up: Dixon carries his cooking belongings from the frat house (right) as police officers stand nearby . But Howard added that he will miss his job and the fraternity's members. 'There'll never be another job like this one again,' he said. 'This was one of a kind. I'll miss my family.' On Tuesday, photos emerged showing Mr Dixon moving his belongings out of the house. After it emerged that the beloved chef would be losing his job, Oklahoma University alumni launched online fundraisers, which have already raised more than $45,000 for the man and his family. One former SAE member created an\u00a0Indiegogo fundraiser, writing: 'He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids... Because of these kids' actions, many will be affected. None more so than Howard.' Howard, he writes, 'was always there to chat with you' but now 'he is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade.' Support: Howard has worked as a chef at Oklahoma University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years and alumni remembered his famous chili dogs and how he had an 'infectious' smile . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was performed by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday. The society has since been shut down . By early on Tuesday, the fund had amassed more than $33,000 - and it is not the only one. Simultaneously another former SAE brother set up a\u00a0GoFundMe page\u00a0slamming 'the disgusting chant' and lauding Howard as 'hard-working and loyal'. That page has raised more than $11,000. A Twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote: 'I went to an OU SAE tailgate one time, (had a great time) an i met that man howard, he grills a mean burger.' All members of the fraternity had until midnight on Monday to leave the premises, University of Oklahoma President David Boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage. On Tuesday, Boren expelled two students after he said they were identified as leaders of the chant. Hitting back: The fraternity's now-defunct building has been spraying with graffiti reading 'TEAR IT DOWN' Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above; students left last night .

The grandfather preyed on by fraudsters . Derrick Blake was shocked when he received a cold call from somebody who knew details of his past financial investments. The caller used the information to try to scam the grandfather, 75, into handing over his bank details. Mr Blake, who is a carer for his wife Anita, now believes the scammer got his details from B2C. The caller claimed to be from a utility company Mr Blake previously had shares in, but sold seven years ago. They told him he still had 180 shares with them and offered to buy them from him. Luckily, he consulted his son, who immediately realised it was a scam. He said: \u2018What is shocking is how they knew all this information about me. How did they know I had those shares? \u2018One caller also knew I had arthritis \u2013 where did that come from? They know more about my life than I do, it seems.\u2019 Mr Blake, a retired Thames waterman, often receives surveys asking him very specific personal information, such as how much his house is worth, his earnings and investments. He and his wife, who has recently suffered three strokes, have also been offered will-writing and funeral services, which Mr Blake described as \u2018insensitive\u2019.

Wye Valley called Mr Nealer on his home phone and sent him letters claiming he had won such a prize.

Like several other pensioners on B2C\u2019s database Mr West, 68, has had conmen try to hack into his PC. On these occasions he has been telephoned by people from China or India claiming to be calling on behalf of Microsoft. \u2018They start by saying that my computer needs updating or has errors and then ask me to turn it on and log in,\u2019 he said. Thankfully, Mr West \u2013 a chartered engineer \u2013 consulted a computer expert he knew, who told him immediately it was a scam. On Microsoft\u2019s website it says that such cons are unfortunately common. Thousands of people are thought to have been scammed over the phone, including the elderly (file picture) Couple targeted by computer scammers . Malcolm Williams and his wife, Carol, receive at least two nuisance calls a day \u2013 and almost fell victim to the same con artists as Mr West. They suspect they were targeted because they were on the same set of data being sold by B2C. Both couples were told, by a company falsely claiming to be Microsoft, that their computers needed fixing so they could access it remotely and steal their personal details. The couple get cold calls both on their mobiles and landline. The nuisance calls have got worse in the past three weeks. Mr Williams, 66, a retired cabin crew member for British Airways, said he was outraged that his details are being sold. \u2018What right has anyone got to be selling these kinds of details? We are always so careful about giving information away and never answer calls when they ask for our details.\u2019 The disabled man plagued by calls . Retired lorry driver John Edghill receives \u2018constant\u2019 calls from businesses claiming to be from the Government or trying to get him to answer personal survey questions. The 65-year-old, who lost both his legs in a road accident in 2004, said: \u2018I am so careful not to give anything away about myself. I never tick boxes on forms where it says your information can be shared.\u2019 Mr Edghill is also getting a growing number of calls about his finances and pension. He said cold calls made life a misery for disabled people who had to struggle to get to the phone, only to find it was a call about marketing or a scam. Widower who fears answering his phone . Kenneth Longford receives around four nuisance calls a day \u2013 which he believes is as a result of once filling in a form with a clothing catalogue. Ever since he did so, he has received a growing number of calls ranging from PPI to prize-draws. Mr Longford, 72, who lost his wife Vicky in 2010 to motor neurone disease, said he was \u2018disgusted\u2019 to discover his details had ended up on B2C\u2019s database. The father-of-two and grandfather-of-five, who lives alone in a bungalow, added: \u2018I barely ever answer the phone nowadays. \u2018It\u2019s worrying for people who are more vulnerable than me, and who knows who has my information now.\u2019",

        "article": "Frank Lampard has no regrets over delaying his move to New York City FC \u2013 but has already pencilled in the date when he faces Steven Gerrard for the first time. The Manchester City midfielder was expected to join the club's sister outfit for their maiden MLS season which kicked off earlier this month. But in a controversial move which angered many of the new franchise's supporters, he extended his stay at the Etihad Stadium to the end of the season as Manuel Pellegrini's men attempt to retain their Premier League title. Frank Lampard delayed his move to New York City FC to see out the season with Manchester City . The former Chelsea legend has no regrets in controversially putting off his move to the MLS . Lampard's decision has been questioned after starting only two games for City in 2015 . With Lampard's former club Chelsea now six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand, and having started just two matches since the turn of the year, some have questioned the logic behind the decision. But the veteran midfielder, who won 11 trophies in a glittering 13 years at Stamford Bridge, has no such thoughts. 'I\u2019m very fortunate,' he said. 'This part of my career, coming to City, was something I never saw coming and when I look back and think, blimey, at 36 I got asked to come to the champions and a club with this pedigree of player here. 'I\u2019m delighted that happened as it has done and I\u2019m delighted with the future I\u2019 ve got and the opportunity to go on and play in New York and individually try to help there, but also be part of a new football club in one of the greatest cities in the world.' The veteran midfielder poses in front of the New York skyline after signing for the new franchise . The 36-year-old was all smiles after being introduced as a New York City player in July 2014 . Lampard will join former Spain and Barcelona star David Villa (centre) at his new club . Former England team-mate Steven Gerrard will also head across the Atlantic at the end of the season to join rivals LA Galaxy. And Lampard is relishing the prospect of facing his old pal - when asked when the match takes place he was quick to answer. 'August 23,' he said without hesitation. 'It\u2019s at their place. It\u2019s the day after my daughter\u2019s birthday so I should know!' Lampard believes Liverpool legend Gerrard, 34, has made the right call to follow him to the US after 17 years in the first team at Anfield. Steven Gerrad was sent of in his last game against Manchester United ahead of his own move to America . Former England team-mates never quite clicked while playing together for the national team . Lampard is looking forward to renewing hostilities with Gerrard once they are both playing across the pond . 'I\u2019m pleased for Stevie,' he said. 'I think it\u2019s a very good move for him. What more can he do at Liverpool? 'He\u2019s had a fantastic career.' Lampard added that the pair, who retired from international duty a month apart last year, became close during their time with the Three Lions. 'We get on very well, particularly in our latter years, as captain and vice-captain of England,' he explained. 'I\u2019ve a huge amount of respect for him and look forward to getting up against him out there.' Gerrard has signed to join MLS champions LA Galaxy where David Beckham and Robbie Keane have starred . Another of the MLS's marquee signings has been Brazil legend Kaka arriving at Orlando City . Lampard believes it is the right moment to go for Gerrard, who was sent off 38 seconds after coming off the bench in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. 'I think only individuals know the right time for them,' he said. 'I wasn\u2019t sure about my time as a Chelsea player. The decision got made for me. When the decision is not made for you, and you have to make it yourself then it\u2019 s more difficult maybe. Only he knows that and I think at the minute I would say yes because what more can he do? If not their greatest player he will be right up there with the greatest players ever.'",

        "article": "The US military\u2019s Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including Ebola. By encoding RNA and DNA in a specific way, Darpa say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease. This could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas. US military's Darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases. It involves encoding RNA and DNA with instructions for antibodies. A person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy (stock image shown). This enables a person's cells to fight an infectious disease . \u2018We\u2019re going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm,\u2019 said Darpa programme manager Dan Wattendorf at an event in San Francisco, reported Fusion. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. \u2018There\u2019s a low-cost of goods, no cold chain, and we would produce the correct antibody in [any] individual directly.\u2019 The method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease. \u2018Instructions\u2019 on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into RNA and DNA, which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease. Their cells then start creating the antibodies, protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease. Darpa is currently funding the project through Emory University in Atlanta. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria. Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as US pharmaceutical company Mapp Biopharmaceutical's experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp. Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective, would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu, malaria and Ebola. Shown is a transmission electron micrograph (Tem) image of the Ebola virus . Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming. This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warned last month that humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens. Professor Brooks says it will be 'the death of a thousand cuts' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world. 'It's not that there's going to be one \"Andromeda Strain\" that will wipe everybody out on the planet,' Professor Brooks said, referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen. 'There are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems.' Darpa has awarded Emory up to \u00a37.3 million ($10.8 million) over three years to direct the project. Emory is using blood samples from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to test the method. Initially, the technology was being developed in hopes of protecting soldiers from seasonal flu or germs that cause diarrhea on the battlefield, but the Ebola outbreak presented an opportunity to accelerate the research. To succeed, researchers will need to identify an effective delivery system to carry the genetic instructions into the body and learn how to quickly identify the most protective antibodies. The goal is to get the process down to 90 days for most diseases. The group is in the process of characterising several Ebola antibody candidates to find which are the most potent. At that point, the researchers and Darpa will seek out drug company partners. Testing in people could begin within two years, with the goal of having a better weapon for the next outbreak - whatever it may be.",

        "article": "The father of a Scottish woman who fled to join Islamic State has denied she was involved in recruiting three London schoolgirls believed to have travelled to Syria. Aqsa Mahmood, 20, left her home in Glasgow in November 2013 and married an IS militant the following February. Today, her parents told ITV News she had been in contact with them to deny recent reports that she had encouraged Bethnal Green Academy students Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16 and Amira Abase, 15, to join the radical Islamist group. Scroll down for video . The father of jihadi bride Aqsa Mahmood (pictured left and right) denies she was involved in recruiting three London schoolgirls believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State . Muzaffar Mahmood said his daughter had claimed she didn't even know the names of the girls, and he added that he believed her. 'She texted when this was going on,' he said. 'She was never in contact with them and I believe her. 'A lot of press - everything happening is Aqsa Mahmood.' But after the girls went missing last month, it emerged that Shamima had messaged a Twitter account belonging to Mahmood asking her to follow her. She did so, opening a private line of communication. At the time, the family expressed their horror that she may have been involved in recruiting the girls and branded her a 'disgrace'. Muzaffar Mahmood said his daughter had contacted the family to insist she didn't know the names of the missing London schoolgirls, and he said he believed her . Aqsa's mother Khalida Mahmood also called for her daughter to leave Syria and return to Britain . Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message (pictured) to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication . But today, Mr Mahmood said: 'They are making her\u2026everything happening is Aqsa Mahmood. 'Security services\u2026if they know anything they should come out with it. 'She was very angry with me that 'why are you not standing up for me? I wasn't in contact. I don't even know their names. 'That's what she told us. We feel really bad when we hear in the press that she recruited them. 'We regret what she is doing and we condemn what's going on over there but she hasn't been in touch with them [the runaway girls] at all. It's very painful.' The former diagnostic radiography student had been educated at a top private school in the city, but after joining the terror group, began tweeting under the nom de guerre Umm Layth. She posted a series of radical messages, including a call for others to copy the shocking murder of soldier Lee Rigby, the Boston Marathon bombing and the massacre at the Fort Hood US Army base in Texas. Kadiza Sultana, 16 (left), Amira Abase, 15 (centre) and Shamima Begum, 15 (right), all pupils at Bethnal Green Academy in east London, are believed to have travelled to Syria as jihadi brides . Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends were pictured preparing to board a flight to Istanbul, Turkey . Mahmood has also posted a series of blog posts entitled 'Diary of a Muhajirah' instructing young women on how to prepare for life in Syria and what to do expect there. She also wrote a guide on how to be a war widow in January, sparking rumours her extremist husband has been killed. After the former student's identity was revealed in the media last September, her family branded her a 'bedroom radical' and condemned her actions. Sharmeena Begum was named as the first of four Bethnal Green Academy schoolgirls to have fled home to join IS . At a press conference, they said: \u2018We still love you Aqsa but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. \u2018All parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we feel nothing but sorrow and shame for Aqsa. 'Aqsa you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.\u2019 Her family said Mahmood was \u2018brainwashed and deluded\u2019 but maintained there was no individual to be blamed for her radicalisation. But today, when asked if there was anything that pointed to her being radicalised, Mr Mahmood said: 'This is something we want to know. She did pray and wore a scarf. 'Freedom of expression and she's allowed to do that. There's nothing wrong with that, we never see she's going that far. 'That's something we're still trying to find out. Who are these people radicalising all the children here and why is something not happening to them? Where are people going all the time? 'There are people here who are doing this. And police and security services? We've not had any answers yet.' Mr Mahmood pointed the finger at intelligence services for failing to discover who was 'radicalising our children', and claimed he and his wife had simply given their daughter freedoms afforded in any 'normal' family. He also criticised British police for not doing more to 'save our daughter' when she initially made the journey. His comments come after the families of the three London schoolgirls appeared before appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee this week. And the country\u2019s top police officer was forced to apologise to their families over a misplaced letter relating to a fourth girl\u2019s disappearance, who was identified this week as Sharmeena Begum. The report will air on ITV News at 6.30pm and Ten and can be found online at itv.com/news . Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee this week . Bethnal Green Academy student Shamima Begum, 15, sent an open message to Aqsa Mahmood, 20, who had fled to Syria from Glasgow to be a 'jihadi bride' in 2013, asking her to open a private line of communication. Four days later, the teenager flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15. Last month, a lawyer for Mahmood's family said they were 'full of horror and anger' that she was being allowed by Twitter to 'recruit and encourage' others to travel to Syria. 'You are a disgrace': The family of Aqsa Mahmood (pictured) said they are 'incredulous' that her messages are not being checked and her victims' families did not get a 'knock at the door' Aamer Anwar said they were 'incredulous' that her messages were not being checked and her victims' families did not get a 'knock at the door'. He said the grooming of children through Twitter by terrorists was 'tantamount to child abuse'. The family's statement in full: . 'The family of Aqsa Mahmood are full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to ISIS. They are not sure how much more misery that Aqsa can inflict on her own family but the fact that she is now accused of destroying other families is beyond the pale. However the Security Services have serious questions to answer- Aqsa's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago, yet despite alleged contact between the girls and Aqsa, they failed to stop them from leaving the UK to Turkey a staging post for Syria. Sadly despite all the Government's rhetoric on ISIS, if they can't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join ISIS, what is the point of any new laws? As for Aqsa- you are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam. You are killing your family every day with your actions, they are begging you stop if you ever loved them.'",

Despite having his differences with the Saints last summer the France international has impressed this term . However, Arsenal are increasing their interest in the Frenchman and are prepared to make an offer . His stock has risen this season after a string of excellent displays for Ronald Koeman\u2019s side. Schneiderlin, 25, was furious last summer after the club refused to sanction a move to Tottenham during the final weeks of the transfer window. But his subsequent attitude impressed the club, who want to reward him for his work this season. However, with the Gunners in the background, Schneiderlin is by no means guaranteed to sign a new deal. In that case the Saints will slap a high price on him in an attempt to put off potential suitors. Upwards of \u00a325million has been discussed by the Saints hierarchy if they are forced to part with the Frenchman at the end of the season.

        "article": "Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is quite a mouthful. Which is why locals refer to this region of lakes, castles, and beaches in the North-east of Germany as MV, or Meck-Pom. The Pom refers to Pomerania, now mostly in Poland. It has a long coastline on the Baltic and is the third largest of Germany's 16 Laender - but the least populated. So you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage, except in your lunch. Back in focus: 'Meck-Pom' offers blissful beaches along Germany's Baltic Sea coastline . After World War II, Meck-Pom was part of Communist East Germany, which might account for its low profile. The regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside, so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated. Since reunification 25 years ago, all that has changed. The result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully-run resorts. The sea accounts for the region's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund and Greifswald - were part of the 13th-century trading confederation, the Hanseatic League, which did business with Scandinavians and Slavs around the Baltic. Two of the cities, Wismar and Stralsund, are World Heritage Sites. Towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red-brick, moulded and baked from the sodden clay. The harbour has bars, cafes and shops for windsurfers, anglers and bucket-and-spaders. On the road, go-kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests. A day's fishing off a boat costs \u20ac39 (\u00a327), including lunch from a stewpot. At the beach resorts of Boltenhagen and Warnemunde, holidaymakers on hire bikes (\u00a36.50 a day) pedal through pine-filled parks to the sea-front. A steam train called Molli plies a coastal route to Heiligendamm, location of the five-star Grand Hotel. It has a sanatorium, a Michelin-star chef, a castle (for weddings) and a children's house with games. Quietly charming: The pretty Alte Markt square in Stralsund sums up the region's appeal . Meck-Pom is a refuge in peace and war. Forewarned of the Allied bombing, citizens of Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden fled here. 'The castles were full of refugees,' says Freiherr Helmuth von Maltzahn, proprietor of 16th-century Schloss Ulrichshusen, which his ancestor Ulrich built among the inland lakes. Helmuth, born in 1949, bought back his burnt-out family home and turned it into a 40-room hotel. At sunset, cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks, for a moment, like an intricate, interweaving MV-formation. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Hamburg from \u00a379 return.

        "article": "A multi-million-pound office building just off Trafalgar Square has been taken over by anarchist squatters. Around 50 people are currently living in the former offices of the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall in central London after moving in on Friday night. The self-proclaimed 'Bourgeois Squatters' today vowed to stay put for 'as long as possible' in the building, not far from Buckingham Palace, which they targeted because it was originally opened by Tony Blair. Scroll down for video . Takeover: Squatters are living in this building on Pall Mall in central London, formerly home to the Institute of Directors . Window: The window is full of anarchist posters denouncing globalisation and the capitalist system . Inside: The interior of the empty office building now contains the squatters' personal belongings . They claim they are intending to highlight a 'housing crisis' in London - but insist that not all the squatters are political activists. Although they have already received a court summons, they ignored the document and did not attend the legal hearing. The property has ashtrays and drinks glasses strewn across the floor, while half-eaten in what appear to be Ocado and Co-op bags have been piled up in rooms. The anarchists say that they have not done any permanent damage to the building, designed by Scottish architect Alexander Peebles, apart from vandalising the plaque which records Mr Blair opening the premises in 2001. The building is currently on the market with estate agent Cluttons after being vacated several months ago by the IoD, which used it as an annexe to its main headquarters a few doors away. Food: Half-eaten meals in what appeared to be Ocado and Co-op bags were seen in a corner of the squat . Vandalised: This plaque recording the opening of the building by Tony Blair was defaced by the squatters . Posters: The Cluttons advert was defaced, while another poster showed the heads of Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron on stakes . Hallway: A welcome table appeared to have been set up at the bottom of the stairs in the building . Mockery: One of the anti-capitalist messages painted on a poster in the window . One squatter, 28-year-old Dominic, who was previously jailed for assaulting a police officer during an anti-capitalist protester, said that the group intended to take care of the building. Referring to the mess on the floor, he said: 'We do clean up after ourselves every morning - we just haven't had the chance to do it yet. 'When we leave they will get the building back in pretty much the same condition in which we found it in. We respect the property.' He added: 'We call ourselves Bourgeois Squatters. We all have different views. Some are here to make a political point, but some are not. 'But the main point for us all is that there are million, even billion, pound properties standing empty and I think it is disgusting that these buildings are left empty when there is a housing crisis going on in London. Message: A protester known as Patrick writes out a sign to be put in the window . Cheery: One message simply said 'Have a nice day' in contrast to other more aggressive posters . Washing up: This morning the squatters claimed they had not yet had time to do the cleaning . Claim: The squatters say they have a legal right to be in the building and have ignored a court summons . Aggressive: Some posters declared 'Class war' and 'The working class strikes back' 'We have a wide range of people here - chefs, caterers, law and politics students, and even an aspiring model - with an age range from about 18 to 60.' Dominic claimed the building's link with Mr Blair was one reason the squatters moved in. 'We just saw it was empty and decided to take it,' he said. 'It is a massive building to be empty, and we could see that plaque through the door - the building was opened by Tony Blair who is a war criminal and has blood on his hands, so we decided to take it.' Some of the posters in the window proclaim an apparently violent message - one has a picture of Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg's heads on spike, with the words: 'The only cuts we want to see.' Another shows a picture of a cemetery captioned 'We have found new homes for the rich.' Defiance: One poster made a reference to the late anti-war protester Brian Haw, who lived in Parliament Square . Contraband: A police hat appeared to be hanging from a coathook in the office building . Celebration: A squatter draped in the Irish flag in an apparent homage to St Patrick's Day . The squatters say they will stay 'as long as possible', but do not yet know how long they will be able to remain. 'We took it on Friday and already by Sunday we had a notice asking us to go to court, but I don't think anybody went,' Dominic said. Although the property still has electricity and running water, the squatters insist they are not stealing the utilities. A spokesman for the IoD, which represents the interests of company directors, said that the institute has had no link to the property since moving out. He added: 'We don't mind a good strong, serious, debate - even if we don't agree with the squatters with a lot of things - and they are entitled to their opinion. 'We vacated this building six months ago, but there\u2019s a chance there are some old Hayek or Adam Smith books left behind. Who knows, perhaps they\u2019ll learn something.' The Metropolitan Police said they were unable to act unless they received a complaint from the landlord. A spokesman for Cluttons did not respond to a request for comment.",

Lewandowski had been the one to throw the ball in the air before\u00a0Szczesny pulled off the amazing shot . The pair are currently on international duty with Poland ahead of Sunday's Euro qualifier against Ireland . Szczesny has not played for Arsenal in the Premier League since a disappointing performance in the defeat by Southampton on New Year's Day, after which he was caught smoking in the showers. He has made three appearances for the Gunners in the FA Cup victories over Brighton, Middlesbrough and Manchester United, but it is widely suspected that manager Arsene Wenger now considers David Ospina to the club's first-choice stopper. And former Poland goalkeeper Jerzey Dudek believes that Szczesny should look for a new club at the end of the season if he is to continue his international career. Dudkek told TVP Sport, 'If I were in his place, I would wonder whether there are still opportunities to arise at Arsenal and wouldn't wait as long as (Swansea City's Polish 'keeper) Fabianski, because you can see that Arsene Wenger is firmly set on David Ospina.' Szczesny has fallen out of favour at Arsenal and has not played in the Premier League since January .

        "article": "A BBC boss has insulted nearly half the country by dismissing them using marketing jargon. Creative director Alan Yentob was trying to rebut the allegation that the corporation caters only for the \u2018metropolitan elite\u2019. The executive, who earns around \u00a3330,000 a year, insisted that the BBC appeals to all sorts of audiences because it airs programmes that \u2018reach out to\u2026 C2s [and] DEs\u2019. Scroll down for video . BBC creative director Alan Yentob has been mocked for using marketing speak to deny that the broadcaster was elitist describing working class people as 'C2s' and 'Ds' as he defended Jeremy Clarkson's sacking . Mr Yentob's comments quickly attracted the attention of social media users, who criticised the way he had described viewers . Robert MacDonald, tweeted: 'Did Alan Yentob really just say 'lots of our programmes reach out to C2 Ds' (in rejecting BBC is for 'metropolitan elite')?' C2 and DE are terms used by marketing professionals to describe the working classes \u2013 more than 47 per cent of the UK population. Mr Yentob\u2019s extraordinary declaration on Newsnight on Wednesday was an attempt to prove what an inclusive organisation the BBC is, amid concern that a huge swathe of its audience will stop tuning in now Jeremy Clarkson has been axed from Top Gear. However, his comments backfired as viewers used social media to accuse him of arrogance and sounding so \u2018out of touch\u2019 they thought it was a spoof. They accused Mr Yentob of using obscure jargon that only the metropolitan elite would understand, in a way that suggested that working class viewers are a niche audience. John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, accused Mr Yentob of \u2018arrogance\u2019 which only confirmed his status as part of the metropolitan elite. He said: \u2018In essence, he\u2019s admitting that the BBC doesn\u2019t do much for the working classes, and he is doing that in a way that is not making it easy for many people to understand.\u2019 Mr Yentob \u2013 who earns more than \u00a3180,000 a year as creative director as well as an estimated \u00a3150,000 fee for editing and presenting the BBC arts series Imagine \u2013 made the remarks as he attempted to explain the decision to fire Clarkson. Mr Yentob was appearing on Newsnight to defend the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson, whose contract is not being renewed after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon . Twitter user Sacred Antinous wrote: 'Yentob describes all those who aren't 'metropolitan elite' as C2DEs. Our licence fee is so well spent on this man of the people #newsnight' The terms C2s and Ds are marketing terms to describe working class people . Presenter Emily Maitlis asked if getting rid of the Top Gear host would make it harder for the BBC to reach \u2018a demographic... increasingly disregarded\u2019 by a corporation which \u2018plays largely to the metropolitan elite\u2019. Apparently unaware of the irony, Mr Yentob responded: \u2018I don\u2019t know that I would buy that, actually, about the metropolitan elite. 'There are quite a lot of programmes which reach out to audiences which are C2s, DEs, which aren\u2019t the metropolitan elite.\u2019 The terms are part of the Approximated Social Grade, which defines social groups by occupation. AB (22 per cent of the UK) broadly covers higher and intermediate managerial. C1 (31 per cent) is supervisory, clerical and junior managerial. C2 (21 per cent) is skilled manual while DE (26 per cent) is semi-skilled and unskilled, plus the unemployed. Others questioned whether the BBC really were keen to make programmes that appealed to all audiences . Toby Wood said: 'Only metropolitan elite luvvies speak like Alan Yentob on @BBCNewsnight - he's in more opaque bubble than Westminster politicians #Clarkson' A BBC spokesman said: \u2018There\u2019s nothing elitist about making programmes and services used by 97 per cent of people every week, and that\u2019s the point Alan made.\u2019 Mr Yentob admitted that axing Clarkson marked \u2018a bad day\u2019 for the BBC. But he said director general Lord Hall felt he had no choice after the Top Gear star\u2019s unprovoked physical and verbal attack on his producer. However, he refused to rule out Clarkson returning to the BBC. Clarkson  attacked Mr Tymon (pictured) leaving him in such a state that he later took himself to A&E . The BBC has said that Top Gear will continue without Clarkson, but there are doubts as to whether co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May will return . Consumers are sometimes grouped into classes or social grades used to describe their social grade and earnings for market research purposes. Social grade A denotes people of upper middle class who have higher manergerial, administrative or professional roles, B and C1 are middle class, C2 are the skilled working class, D are working class and E are low grade workers or state pensioners with no other income. These social grade demographics were originally developed by the National Readership Survey to provide audience research for advertising in newspapers and magazines to show the audience for each publication. However, they now more widely used in\u00a0market and statistical research and analysis, as well as social commentary.",

        "article": "Holland beat Spain 2-0 in a friendly on Tuesday to earn embattled coach Guus Hiddink some breathing space after a poor start to his second term in charge of the national team. Centre back Stefan de Vrij and midfielder Davy Klaassen scored first-half goals in the morale-boosting victory. Spain, thrashed 5-1 by Holland at the World Cup, never looked like gaining revenge thanks to a combination of bad finishing and good goalkeeping by Kenneth Vermeer. Stefan de Vrij (second from left) heads a cross from team-mate Wesley Sneijder past Spain goalkeeper David de Gea to make it 1-0 . Holland defender De Vrij celebrates after giving the hosts the lead against Spain after just 13 minutes . Davy Klaassen doubles Holland's advantage after seeing his initial effort saved by Spain goalkeeper De Gea . Klaassen celebrates  as De Gea screams at his defence after conceding a second goal after just 18 minutes in Amsterdam . It was a double celebration for De Vrij (left), Daley Blind (centre) and Bruno Martins Indi as they celebrated 25 caps for the Holland team . Holland:\u00a0Vermeer, Janmaat, de Vrij, Martins Indi, Willems, Blind (De Guzman 73), Sneijder (Wijnaldum 62), Klaassen, Narsingh, Huntelaar (Dost 79), Depay (Afellay 84) Subs not used:\u00a0Cillessen, van der Wiel, Veltman, Bruma, Nigel de Jong, Luuk de Jong, Promes,  Krul . Goals: De Vrij 13, Klaassen 16 . Spain:\u00a0De Gea, Carvajal, Albiol, Pique (San Jose 68), Bernat, Fabregas, Mario Suarez (Ramos 68), Isco (Silva 45), Cazorla (Iniesta 76), Juanmi (Morata 62), Pedro (Vitolo 45) Subs not used: Casillas, Bartra, Busquets, Koke, Juanfran,   Sergio Asenjo . Referee: William Collum (Scotland) Hiddink's second stint as coach has been disastrous so far. In seven matches ahead of Tuesday's friendly, his team had beaten only Kazakhstan and Latvia in European qualifiers and lost to Italy, the Czech Republic, Iceland and Mexico in qualifiers and friendlies. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, missing Chelsea striker Diego Costa, fielded an experimental side at the Amsterdam Arena, while Hiddink again had to make do without his injured stars Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben and was also missing center back Ron Vlaar. The veteran coach made five changes to the team that needed an extra-time equaliser on Saturday to salvage a 1-1 draw against Turkey that left Holland third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group A. Scorer De Vrij had a double celebration as he, along with Daley Blind and Bruno Martins Indi, marked their 25th cap. Blind posted a picture of the trio on Instagram with the message: 'Happy with the win against Spain! What a result! Also proud of my achievement; 25 caps for the Dutch squad! Congrats to @stefandevrij3 and @brunomartinsindi.' After the game, Dutch captain Wesley Sneijder said: ''We had a point to prove after the match against Turkey and we did that well.' De Vrij gave Holland the lead in the 13th minute when he headed in a cross from Sneijder after Spain only half-cleared a corner. Ajax midfielder Klaassen scored his first international goal to double the Dutch lead three minutes later when he slipped away from Santi Cazorla and fired a shot that David de Gea parried before Klaassen hammered in the rebound. Vermeer preserved the lead with two good saves around the half-hour mark as Spain pressed forward. First the Feyenoord keeper advanced off his line to deny a rushing Gerard Pique and two minutes later scrambled to swat away the ball after Pedro had dispossessed Bruno Martins Indi. Willems, brought in to left back to provide more attacking options, looked vulnerable early, giving away the ball twice in dangerous positions before providing the assist for Klaassen's goal. 'We have to learn from those mistakes where we shot ourselves in the foot,' Hiddink said. Goalscorer De Vrij slides in on Spain midfielder Mario Suarez during the first half on Tuesday evening .

Spain looked the more dangerous team after the break but could not convert its chances. Cesc Fabregas and Vitolo both missed good chances before substitute David Silva finally found the net in the 70th minute - only to be ruled offside. In between, Martins Indi missed a simple chance to put the match beyond Spain's reach when he headed a Sneijder cross into the ground and over the bar from close range. 'It's a shame we didn't take three points at the weekend,' Hiddink said. 'But this gives the team confidence.'",

Now, however, Marca hint that Bale will be able to shine even given the right role at the Bernabeu.

        "article": "A portrait of a rare Amur tiger family captured on film in the wild has provided clues that the notoriously solitary male big cats may play a role in rearing cubs. Scientists have long believed that the large adult males tend to leave females to raise their young and they are known to even attack and kill cubs when they come across them. However, in an astonishing new set of images captured by a camera trap in the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in eastern Russia, a large male Amur tiger is seen leading a family of three cubs and their mother through the snowy forest. Scroll down for video of the tiger family passing the camera trap . The above photograph, captured with a camera trap, shows a family of three Amur tiger cubs and a female being led through a snowy forest by a large male in the\u00a0Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in east Russia. It was created by stitching together several images . The images could help scientists learn new details of the role male tigers play in rearing their young. Dr Svetlana Soutyrina, deputy director for scientific programs at the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve who set the camera traps, said: 'We have collected hundreds of photos of tigers over the years, but this is the first time we have recorded a family together. Also known as the Siberian tiger, the Amur tiger is one of the most endangered big cats on the planet. They are a subspecies of tiger, that along with the Bengal tiger, are the biggest cats in the world. The largest male measured more than 3.5 metres (11 feet) in length and can weigh up to 318kg (701lbs). Their range once extended right across Siberia and down into China and South Korea. However, heavy poaching and loss of their natural range due to habitat loss has caused their populations to plummet. There are now just 500 left living in the wild. 'These images confirm that male Amur tigers do participate in family life, at least occasionally, and we were lucky enough to capture one such moment.' There have been a few rare examples of male Bengal tigers taking an active role in parenting in the past but it has never been seen in Amur tigers. In 2011 a male was found to be caring for a pair of orphaned cubs in the Ranthambore tiger reserve in Rajasthan, India. However, such behaviour is extremely rare and more commonly male tigers will kill the cubs of another male to reduce competition. After mating male tigers tend to leave a female to rear the cubs herself but will provide protection for them while they remain inside his territory. Large males will often have several females in their territory. In some rare cases they have also been seen to kill prey to feed his family. The pictures were captured as part of a project between the Wildlife Conservation Society's Russia Program, the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park. Camera traps set up in the forest captured the family in a series of 21 images over a period of two minutes as they walked past. The resulting images were then stitched together to show the family as a whole. Jonathan Slaght, , Russia Program Project Manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'Male Amur tigers, which have home ranges that typically overlap the home ranges of several females, try to associate with those females as they patrol their own territories. 'An adult male might pass through a female\u2019s territory every one or two months so, if the male and female were to meet up every time, this behavior might occur 6-12 times per year. 'However, considering that an adult male Amur tiger has a home range between 1,000-2,000 square kilometers, and an adult female has a territory about 400 square kilometers, having a camera trap in the right place at the right time to document this\u2014especially with young in tow\u2014is incredibly rare. 'In fact, this behaviour of an adult male Amur tiger traveling with a family unit of a female and her cubs has never been photographed before.' The large male tiger was the first to trigger the camera trap (above) as he broke the trail for his family through the forest in east Russia . The Amur tiger cubs, two of which can be seen above, followed closely in their parents footsteps, triggering the trap as they passed . Amur tigers are among the most endangered big cats in the world - thee are just 430-500 left remaining in the wild. Dr Dale Miquelle, Russia director for Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'This is the first time such behaviour has been photographed for Amur tigers in the wild. 'These photos provide a small vignette of social interactions of Amur tigers, and provide an evocative snapshot of life in the wild for these magnificent animals.' The tigers were captured on film using camera traps that were set up in the forests of Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in eastern Russia .",
        "highlights": "Extraordinary picture shows male leading female and cubs through Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve in east Russia .\nLarge adult male tigers usually have several mates within their territory and leave females to raise their cubs alone .\nMales are usually highly aggressive and can pose a threat to small cubs - killing those belonging to rival males .\nAmur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are critically endangered with less than 500 thought to be left  in the wild .\nThe new picture\u00a0suggests that male tigers may play a far greater role in rearing cubs than was previously believed .",

The Louisiana Tech chapter is the third SAE house accused of using the horrifying song that was sung by members of the fraternity at the University of Oklahoma over the weekend. On Wednesday, the president of the University of Texas said he had ordered an investigation into claims brothers at SAE in Austin had used the tune. The fraternity headquarters is investigating in Texas, as well. The vile song 'there will never be a n***** SAE' was sung at the fraternity's chapter at Louisiana Tech University in 2010 and 2011, a former pledge and a former member claim . SAE is also investigating reports that the song was used at the SAE chapter at the University of Texas-Austin . According to BuzzFeed, one former members of the fraternity and one former pledge both said they had witnessed the racist chant in 2010. The former SAE member, who remained anonymous, said he had heard it at least a dozen times in 2010 and 2011. 'The chant was never taught to us during our official pledge education. It was taught in private,' the former SAE said. He added that the university didn't make up the song, claiming it had been 'going around' the fraternity for years. Louisiana Tech administrators told BuzzFeed on Thursday that they had met with leaders of SAE there and warned them that they had 'zero tolerance' for racist behavior. The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said . Dylan Merriman, who was an SAE pledge, told BuzzFeed he was at a party at the fraternity when a drunken brother chanted 'there will never be a n***** SAE.' Merriman said the member then pointed at a picture of his SAE brother and exclaimed, 'There was never a n-word in this chapter and there never will be.' Merriman said he left the fraternity not long after the incident. SAE spokesman Brandon Weghorst confirmed Thursday investigations into chapters at the University of Texas-Austin and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. Weghorst says none of the allegations have been substantiated, and the UT chapter is being 'fully cooperative.' He says the Louisiana Tech probe is still in its early stages. Late Wednesday, the board of trustees and alumni of the University of Oklahoma's SAE chapter acknowledged in a statement the chant surfaced at the chapter 'three to four years ago.' OU President David Boren said the university is investigating fraternity members to determine their 'level of responsibility.'",

        "article": "These are testing times for Scotland. The embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible Six Nations whitewash await on Saturday. Yet, still, some have faith. After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special. The 32-year-old, who has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career, is not one to take a backwards on the field of play. And he insists that, despite results, Vern Cotter's men are heading in the right direction. Scotland lock Jim Hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine-year international career . Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to Championship rivals England before they take on France in the evening kick-off. An onslaught awaits. But the man who Cotter calls his 'great, old warrior' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon-fodder. And Hamilton, who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012, said: 'I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future. 'Having had the experiences I have had playing for Scotland and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity, something good will come of the time we are going through just now I am sure. 'This squad is in a very good place, more so than in most Six Nations I have been involved in despite the results. On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game, but I think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up. Hamilton insists Scotland are heading in the right direction under Scotland coach Vern Cotter (above) 'We have some fantastic players coming through. Jonny Gray was just 21 on Saturday. Then you have Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Fraser Brown. We are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff. 'The biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could-have, should-have, would-have side. The nearly team. But that will change under Vern Cotter with this group of players, no question. 'I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team. 'Are we better than the wooden spoon this year? Yeah, we probably are. 'If we beat Ireland at the weekend, am I going to be happy with how we did in the Championship? No. I want to win games. I'm here to win Championships. I am here to be part of a Scotland successful team that will come good soon. 'Whether that is with me starting games, on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys, I am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward . 'I will stay here as long as I possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will. I genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very, very well.' Hamilton's optimism is not based in fantasy. Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do \u2014 and, at times, their play has been a joy to behold. All they have to do now is execute Cotter's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their Six Nations matches thus far. 'I genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off,' said the big second row. 'Having played for Leicester and for Saracens in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win, we got used to winning. It's a habit but losing is, as well. 'We can change that habit against Ireland and although we may go into it off some losses, we have positives to take from them. Young flanker Adam Ashe (right) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games . 'For example, look at the England game when we lost early points but went in at half-time winning 13-10 \u2014 which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad. 'Also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic, haven't they? 'It is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80-minute performance. Can we win the game against Ireland at the weekend with what we've got? Of course we can. 'We have shown enough signs that we are good enough and provided we stop making naive mistakes, we can finish the Six Nations with a win and show how well this group of players is progressing.",

Jakub Moravec, 37, had travelled from his home in the Czech Republic to enjoy the natural phenomenon in the scenic surroundings. But he was lucky to escape with relatively minor injuries to his  arm, chest and face after the bear broke into his tent and attacked him. Injured:\u00a0Jakub Moravec, 37, was hospitalised after the bear attacked him as he slept . Scars: Mr Moravec suffered a number of cuts to his arms, chest, shoulders and face following the attack . The remains of a polar bear, which attacked Mr Moravec on Spitsbergen island after travelling to watch tomorrow's solar eclipse . Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Moravec said:\u00a0'We were sleeping in the tent, and when I woke up the polar bear was standing on top of me. 'It went straight to my head. Luckily my colleague shot it.' Moravec said he felt 'happy and fine' and that he only felt scared afterwards. During the attack, he said his thoughts were only 'to save my head'. Zuzanna Hakova, who was part of the same Czech tour party, said that her mother had shot the bear three times using a revolver. She said:\u00a0'We woke to shouts of 'Bear! Bear!' coming from the second tent. 'We had a rifle on the outside of each tent and we also had a revolver in our tent. 'The ones being attacked had no chance of getting their weapon, so my mother took her revolver and shot at the bear three times.' Moravec was one of a group of six campers who had travelled to the\u00a0Svalbard islands in Norway's Arctic to enjoy the eclipse. Attack: The polar bear attacked the tents were the six campers were sleeping, before being shot dead by authorities . Camp: The remote Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible . He is now being treated in Longyearbyen, the islands' capital, for injuries to his face and arm. Police spokesman Vidar Arnesen said the group were on a combined ski and snow scooter trip on the remote islands more than 500 miles north of the Norwegian mainland. Norwegian media had reported that there are many seals in the area, a food source that attracts the bears. The Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible, along with the Faroe Islands. The moon is expected to pass between Earth and the sun on Friday, with a total eclipse beginning at 10.11am GMT in Svalbard and lasting for three minutes. Scene: The tourists had travelled to the Svalbard islands in Norway's Arctic to enjoy the eclipse . Isolated: The group were on a combined ski and snow scooter trip on the remote islands more than 500 miles north of the Norwegian mainland when the bear attacked . Approximately 2,000 tourists from around the world are expected to descend on Svalbard for the chance to observe it. Local authorities have repeatedly warned eclipse chasers of the region's dangerous polar bears. People leaving Svalbard's inhabited areas are required to be accompanied by an armed local guide or carry a rifle. An estimated total of 3,000 polar bears live in the region, far outnumbering the 2,500 inhabitants. There have been five fatal polar bear attacks in Svalbard in the past four decades. The most recent attack occurred in 2011, when 17-year-old British student Horatio Chapple was killed whilst on a school trip.",

        "article": "(CNN)University of Virginia student leaders have scheduled a campus forum with police Friday to discuss allegations of brutality following the bloody arrest of a 20-year-old student that prompted protests at UVA. The incident early Wednesday involved uniformed alcohol control agents and Martese Johnson, an African-American student at UVA. It made headlines around the country and prompted Gov. Terry McAuliffe to order an independent Virginia State Police investigation into what happened. The on-campus forum is scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday. In a Facebook post, the university's Student Council said representatives from Charlottesville, Virginia, police, Albemarle County police and the state Alcohol Beverage Control were to attend the forum \"to engage in a conversation about their relationship with students, or lack thereof, and about the issue of police brutality.\" Johnson's arrest prompted protests among students demanding \"Justice for Martese\" after images circulated showing his bloodied face and clothing. While what happened Wednesday remains under investigation, video from the incident shows Johnson pinned to the ground, screaming: \"I go to UVA! ... You f****** racists! What the f***? How did this happen?\" An officer can be heard telling the man to stop fighting. According to the student's attorney, Daniel Watkins, \"just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head.\" He needed 10 stitches to close the gash in his head, Watkins said. Johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, according to the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which acknowledged he suffered injuries during his arrest. The agents were placed on administrative duties during the investigation, the agency said. The Black Student Alliance said the arrest reminds black UVA students \"of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice.\" In a news release, the university called the arrest disturbing, and University President Teresa Sullivan issued a statement saying that \"every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence.\" Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring appealed for patience. \"Certainly the images that we've all been looking at in Charlottesville are shocking, but it's really important that we get the facts out and understand exactly what happened,\" Johnson said. Friday's forum will be held at a theater on the UVA campus. The Student Council said media would not be allowed to ask questions or bring cameras into the forum but said the event would be live-streamed on the Internet. \"This is a student space -- a chance for students to ask the questions they feel are most pressing to Virginia's most senior law enforcement officials,\" the group said on Facebook. Students leaders asked their contemporaries to tweet questions in advance. As of midmorning Friday, only a handful of tweets had crossed using the proposed hashtag \"#policedialogue.\" \"Is the problematic influence of implicit bias discussed at all during police training,\" Twitter user yaejmeister asked. Among other questions, one student asked why alcohol control agents have police powers. A  third wondered \"is catering to UVa's hypersensitivity preparing our students for the world outside of 'grounds'?\" The incident comes amid a continuing nationwide debate over the use of force by police, particularly involving African-Americans, following the deaths last summer of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. Grand juries in both communities declined to indict white police officers in the deaths, leading to angry protests nationwide and calls for renewed attention to claims of police bullying and brutality.",

Twitter confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the company was working with authorities to verify the seriousness of the threat which claimed employees' necks are 'a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate'. The chilling warning, written in Arabic, featured a picture of Dorsey in a gun's cross-hairs and the Twitter logo. It was posted on Sunday on an anonymous site based in Poland which is used by programmers to share code. Dorsey, who is worth an estimated $2.5billion and lives in California, made no mention of the threat online on Sunday as he tweeted his 2.87million followers. The threat featured a picture of Twitter billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey in a gun's cross-hairs and the Twitter logo . The alleged threat,  first reported by Buzzfeed, mentioned Dorsey and included the words: 'We always come back.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, a Twitter spokesperson said on Monday: 'Our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials.' When entered into Google translate (which does not provide an exact translation) the message is titled: 'Tweets in response to a campaign to delete accounts.' It goes on: 'You started this failed war'. The message then appears to address Dorsey directly and Twitter employees. It reads: 'Hey Jack... when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the Caliphate and supporters scattered among your midst!' It also claimed killing employees 'outside a neighborhood pub' would be no more preventable than the massacres of Charlie Hebdo killer Amedy Coulibaly and Copenhagen shooter Omar el-Hussein. The message later reads: 'Imagine the scene and wait for its occurrence at any moment, and the earliest opportunity! 'Virtual your war on us in the Internet will pull you real wars on earth!' It closes with the threat: 'Is the message reached my Twitter?' ISIS have posted horrific videos and images of executions, including beheadings, on mainstream sites online. According to Twitter's rules: 'You may not publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others.' Twitter and YouTube both removed violent material and propaganda linked to ISIS. California-based Dorsey made no mention of the Twitter threat as he tweeted his 2.87million followers on Sunday night . Killers: The message compared its threat to the murders carried out in Paris by\u00a0Amedy Coulibaly (left) and in Copenhagen by\u00a0Omar el-Hussein (right).

        "article": "What an incredible day of rugby that was. I thought it might be exciting, I hoped it would be exciting but never did I think it would hit the levels it did. What a shame, then, that Scotland allowed themselves to get caught up in the story which unfolded rather than focus on their task at hand. In the second half at BT Murrayfield, Vern Cotter\u2019s men lost the plot rather than doing the basics right and there did not seem to be anyone giving direction in the last 20 minutes. It is an inexperienced side and we saw that naivety in spades on Saturday. Scotland's dismal Six Nations campaign ended with a 40-10 thrashing by Ireland at Murrayfield . Scotland should not concede 40 points at home and lose by a margin of 30 points to Ireland. A championship that promised so much has, ultimately, delivered very little and Scotland\u2019s dismal run in the Six Nations continues. In 12 matches, we have won only once and that was courtesy of a last-minute drop goal in Rome last season. That says it all really. It is particularly painful when placed against the style and substance displayed by the Irish, England, France and Wales on what was a stunning day. For the tournament to go down to the last second of the last game was amazing but it was what happened in the lead-up to those tense dying moments which made Saturday truly remarkable. Scotland's huge loss on Saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table . I thought Wales would rack up a load of points against Italy but they only did this in a devastating second-half display. As that game was drawing to a close, with Wales 28 points better off than Ireland and looking like scoring again, it appeared that it was game over and Wales would win the Six Nations. But they missed the chance and Italy scored down the other end. There was a collective cheer in Italy, Ireland and England because it gave the latter two countries a chance. I felt Wales were still favourites as, although I thought Ireland and England would win their games, I didn\u2019t think they would be able to accumulate enough points to go above Wales. How wrong I was! I felt it was a perfect day for Scotland to really show what they were all about because there was no pressure on them whatsoever and they could just go out and play with total freedom. To a point, they did this but so did Ireland \u2014 and they did it far better than their hosts. Ireland were crowned Six Nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge England and Wales . Both England and Ireland had targets they knew they had to win by to have a chance of lifting the Six Nations trophy. This very rarely happens in rugby and I thought this might mean their focus would be on scoring tries rather than playing the game in the normal safety-first manner. England did adopt this approach and it ultimately cost them but Ireland were able to operate a normal game plan, mainly because of how Scotland were playing. It was an exciting first half where Ireland dominated the early stages but Scotland hung in and eventually played some really good rugby that led to Finn Russell\u2019s try. That was just about it for Scotland and the last 40 minutes of the Championship was painful \u2014 with so many mistakes, turnovers, penalties conceded and poor leadership. England beat France 55-35 at Twickenham but it wasn't enough to overhaul Ireland . Wales had earlier moved into pole position when they beat Italy 61-20 in Rome . With that thumping victory, Ireland set England a target of 26 points that they had to win by to snatch the trophy. The difference in this game was that France really did come to the party and easily produced their best performance of the Six Nations. Mind you, so did England \u2014 and 90 points scored tells you that the attack was very much on top with defence an optional extra at times. That England came within a metre and six points of winning the Six Nations was incredible and the drama was off the scale. When France won a penalty after 80 minutes had passed, the whole of Ireland celebrated but the drama was not over. Inexplicably, France ran the penalty on their own line and gave England one more chance to win the ball back and caused a nation to have a collective heart attack. Eventually they saw sense and kicked the ball out to finish off the most amazing day in the history of the RBS Six Nations. When the dust settled, Ireland were crowned Six Nations champions but huge credit goes to England, Wales and France for their contribution to an incredible day. As for Scotland and Italy, they contributed as well but in a very different way.",

The new boss has revealed that he was waiting for the Black Cats to sack Gus Poyet and was surprised it did not happen sooner. Indeed, in the wake of Sunderland\u2019s 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday there were reports that Advocaat was set to take over, despite this being some 48 hours before Poyet was dismissed. Reports in Holland suggest Dick Advocaat was surprised his predecessor Gus Poyet was not sacked sooner . Poyet was sacked after Sunderland were beaten 4-0 at the Stadium of Light by rivals Aston Villa . Advocaat said John O'Shea (left) will have to play despite not training in the week as the squad is small . The Dutchman said: \u2018I expected they would do it (sack Poyet) earlier, but they didn't. \u2018Poyet was a coach who is very self-focussed. They were looking for someone with experience, a guy who knows what it's about. For this short time they didn't want to take the risk to get an inexperienced coach.\u2019 Advocaat will take charge of the team for the first time at West Ham tomorrow and, with his new club just one point above the Premier League drop zone, he has revealed his stark message to the players. \u2018As I said to the players, it\u2019s quite simple. This is a big, big club \u2013 do you want to play in the other league?\u2019 he said. \u2018With this club, this stadium, you cannot play in the lower league. I think they realise how important it is. Midfield player Sebastian Larsson has also missed training but will be called upon by Advocaat . Advocaat believes Sunderland have a competitive squad when all of their players are fully fit . \u2018We have nine games to go and are still a point ahead, so we have everything in our own hands. \u2018Keeping this team in the league is the most important thing. \u2018There is enough quality in this squad to stay up. We have a difficult programme, as do the other teams, but it\u2019s all up to us and I have a good feeling about it.\u2019 Meanwhile, it has been reported that Advocaat is open to the idea of staying at the club beyond the end of the season. However, it appears some of that was lost in translation from an interview in his homeland and Sportsmail understands he will return to Holland in May.",

Photographs taken in the northern town of Barqah, close to the border with Turkey, show members of ISIS' feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field. The images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs, in the hope it will convince militants to reject the 'slow suicide' caused by cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Up in smoke:\u00a0Photographs taken in the northern town of Barqah, close to the border with Turkey, show members of ISIS' feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field. Flames:\u00a0Petrol is seen being poured over the boxes of cigarettes, which are then set alight . Shocking: The cigarette burning images emerged as it was revealed ISIS has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self-declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs . Images of the mass cigarette burning have been widely shared by ISIS supporters on social media. The terror group has ruled that smoking cigarettes causes cancer and is therefore a form of suicide.\u00a0Taking your own life is deemed a major sin by ISIS and failed attempts - or in the case of cigarettes 'slow' attempts - are considered comparable with murder. Despite this many fighters continue to regularly smoke and abandoned ISIS positions are often found littered with cigarette butts - suggesting a thriving black market exists in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the militants' control. To counter this, ISIS appears to now be relying less on threats and punishments to convince militants to give up smoking, and more on using similar shocking images of cancer victims that now appear on packets of cigarettes in the West. In typical ISIS fashion, however, the terror group took the method to its logical extreme, showing grisly images of lungs being set alight to symbolise the damage smoking does to a human body. Getting ready: The photographs of the cigarette burning in northern Syria show members of ISIS' notorious Hisbah religious police force using huge planks of wood to prepare a bonfire . Images of the mass cigarette burning have been widely shared by ISIS supporters on social media . The photographs of the cigarette burning in northern Syria show members of ISIS' notorious Hisbah religious police force using huge planks of wood to prepare a bonfire in a stretch of barren countryside outside the town of\u00a0Barqah. Several lorries are seen arriving at the site and countless cartons of cigarettes are unloaded - the cargo presumably having been confiscated from local black market salesmen. Petrol is then seen being poured over the boxes of cigarettes, which are then set alight and burst into flames while the chilling black banner of the Islamic State flutters in the wind nearby. Once the fires have been extinguished, the landscape is seen littered with vast piles of burnt cigarette packets. Delivery: Several lorries are seen arriving at the site and countless cartons of cigarettes are unloaded - the cargo presumably having been confiscated from local black market salesmen . Remains:\u00a0Once the fires have been extinguished, the landscape is seen littered with vast piles of burnt cigarette packets . Last November it was revealed that a French jihadist fled ISIS after just two weeks when he decided he would rather face jail in his home country than put up with the terror group's strict ban on smoking. Flavien Moreau, 27 was the first French citizen to be tried for joining ISIS and was sentenced to seven years jail by a court in Paris. Moreau, who has 13 previous convictions ranging from armed robbery to assault, is a Muslim convert. He moved to Syria in 2012 to join ISIS after becoming radicalised in France. But he returned to France just two weeks later, unable to cope with the strict ISIS regime, and was swiftly arrested. Moreau told the court: 'I really struggled with not smoking... It was forbidden by the katiba. I had brought Nicorette gum with me, but it wasn't enough. I left my gun with my emir and I left.' French intelligence officials remain concerned about the number of French nationals involved with ISIS. It is believed at least 930 are actively fighting in Iraq and Syria.",

The Royals face an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford next week following Saturday's goalless draw in Yorkshire. But before that Steve Clarke's side must attempt to ease any fears of being sucked into the Championship relegation battle with two tough matches, the midweek visit of the Seagulls followed by a trip to promotion-chasing Watford on Saturday. Reading manager Steve Clarke watches on from the dugout as Reading drew 0-0 with Bradford on Saturday . Reading captain Alex Pearce broke his nose during the FA Cup last-eight clash . 'Between now and the replay there's two important games for both sides,' said Clarke. 'We want the same resolve and desire on Tuesday night, and hopefully a couple of goals and three points.' Clarke must decide whether to risk centre-half Alex Pearce, who suffered a broken nose in the bruising encounter at Valley Parade. 'I was delighted with the attitude from the players, it was top class,' added Clarke. 'I thought it was typified by our captain coming back on with a broken nose, nothing was going to stop him. His nose is miles over here somewhere. But he went back on, a proper centre-half. 'It would have been easy to say \"I'm not going back on\", but no, Alex said \"patch me up, straighten it later\" and he was straight back on the pitch.' The central defender played on after being patched up on the sideline at Valley Parade . Clarke said that Pearce's attitude typified his side and urged more of the same against Brighton on Tuesday . Brighton, a point and a place below Reading in 19th, will be without striker Sam Baldock who looks set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Kazenga LuaLua is likely to come into the starting line-up in Baldock's absence and the winger expects a stern test against the Royals. 'It's going to be a tough game for us, but every match is going to be tough now,' he told the club website. 'Reading are not far from where we are in the league, but it's still going to be a very difficult game. 'They've a powerful team that has a lot of pace and they've got some good wingers as well. With the squad they have, they may feel they should be in a higher position, but this league is very tough and competitive.'",

Meyer, 26, proposed to Palin, 24, Friday night at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas, Palin said on her blog. \"The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated 'Bless the Broken Road' to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!\" she wrote. \"It's amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God's hands.\" Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer's Instagram, \"This is so 'MERICA that my mind is blown right now.\" Meyer received the nation's highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient -- and the first Marine -- to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother's failed vice presidential bid through appearances on \"Dancing with the Stars\" and a Lifetime show about raising her son, \"Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp.\" She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, \"Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.\" She was previously engaged to Tripp's father, Levi Johnston. The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film \"Amazing America,\" Sarah Palin's show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. \"He met Tripp during that time, and I've seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He's visited us in Alaska, and I've visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,\" she wrote. \"He's wonderful with Tripp and I'm so proud to be marrying him.\" The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. \"I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever,\" Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes. Bristol Palin shared an Instagram picture of a ring and another of the happy couple smooching. \"Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!\" she said. The couple started recently began sharing images on social media of themselves together. Palin posted a photo last week of the couple out in the snow with Tripp. Meyer has also shared a few pictures of him with Sarah Palin. \"Thank you for being the amazing person that you are. I appreciate your leadership and dedication to our country!\" he said in a post on her birthday in February. Sarah Palin also congratulated the couple, noting that Meyer \"flew up North\" to ask Bristol Palin's father and grandfather for her hand in marriage. \"Our families couldn't be happier for Bristol and Dakota! We're honored to welcome Dakota into our family.  He's an American hero and patriot whose service to our country -- like all his fellow Medal of Honor recipients -- has been above and beyond the call of duty; but even more important is he's a good and kind man who loves Bristol and Tripp, and is loved by them,\" she said on Facebook. \"Yes, God working behind the scenes to turn beauty from ashes. Had tough circumstances in their lives not occurred, and had they reacted differently to those circumstances, they'd have never met.\"",

The 29-year-old surpassed all expectations in October 2013, when Peter Ebdon, Mark Williams and Stephen Maguire were among his victims, before Ding Junhui inflicted a 5-0 defeat on the Indian cueman in the title match. Nudged back in the calendar to March this season, 50th-ranked Mehta would have longed to put together another decent run in his home tournament, but the figure of world number eight Walden loomed large in the draw. Ricky Walden saw off Aditya Mehta to deny the Indian a repeat success at his home tournament . And International Championship winner Walden came through a 4-2 winner to reach the last 16, where China's Tian Pengfei awaits him. Former world champions John Higgins and Williams advanced, Scotsman Higgins winning 4-2 against Jamie Cope and Welshman Williams with a final-frame break of 127 to fend off one-time Crucible king Ebdon 4-3. Next up for Williams is world number six Judd Trump, who was given a scare by amateur Adam Duffy and was far from persuasive as he edged through 4-3. Trump has been struggling with a shoulder injury and even considered withdrawing from the tournament. Trump said after beating Duffy: 'The shoulder is better than it was in my first match, though it is still not perfect. 'I don't expect much tomorrow, I will just battle like I did today and see what happens. I'm not going to play my best here. I just need to try to be patient because I know I'm going to miss balls that I don't usually miss.' Williams is hoping to hang around in Mumbai - because he is smitten by the local cuisine. Williams said, according to World Snooker's website: 'I've had two curries a day since I've been here. They are the best curries I've ever had, better than anything back home. If my wife asks me next week if want to go for a curry, I'll definitely have to say no.' Graeme Dott, the 2006 world champion, breezed to a 4-0 win over David Morris, with others through to the last 16 including Jamie Jones, Mark Davis, Kyren Wilson, Michael White, Nigel Bond and Chris Wakelin - the 22-year-old Warwickshire potter reaching the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time after a 4-1 victory over Andrew Pagett.",

But rather than roaming the seven seas, this 34-stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a US aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag. The leatherback, nicknamed Yawkey, was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in South Carolina. Scroll down for video . The rare leatherback sea turtle, nicknamed Yawkey (pictured), was found stranded on a remote beach . The huge turtle, weighing an estimated 500 pounds, is now being treated at South Carolina Aquarium . Rescuers believe Yawkey may have accidentally eaten plastic having mistaken it for his favourite food jellyfish . Rescuers tend to Yawkey at the aquarium where he is being treated with fluids and antibiotics . Yawkey floats in the small tank set up for him at the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston . Experts said it became stranded after it mistook a billowing plastic bag for the jellyfish it feeds on \u2013 a common problem which kills countless sea turtles every year. Eating plastic could cause a build-up of gas in the digestive tract, making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore. The incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans. Recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags, bottles, toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year \u2013 affecting up to 400 different marine species, many of them endangered. The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste. A major victory in the Banish the Bags campaign came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to \u00a3100million a year for good causes. The aquarium hopes to release Yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity . Wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on Saturday. Kelly Thorvalson, a turtle expert at the South Carolina Aquarium Sea Turtle Hospital in Charleston, said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach. They rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback, before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle. There were few signs of external injury to the beast, leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag. \u2018Leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics \u2013 such as bags that look like jellyfish \u2013 could be causing a gastro-intestinal issue,\u2019 Mrs Thorvalson added. Leatherbacks, the biggest of all the sea turtles, swim in six of the seven oceans, roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites. The leatherback turtle\u2019s dark blue shell is leathery to the touch \u2013 giving it its name.

        "article": "The American woman and the Canadian man accused of plotting a bloody Valentines Day massacre in a Halifax shopping mall appeared in court on Friday under tight security. Lindsay Kannitha Souvannarath, 23, of Illinois and Randall Steven Shepherd made a brief appearance in court on charges of conspiracy to commit murder ahead of a preliminary hearing in April. The third alleged co-conspirator, James Gamble, 19, took his own life at home in Timberlea on February 13 ahead of the alleged planned shooting spree when police surrounded his house. Tight security and hand-cuffed: Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath arrives at court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada on Tuesday . Tired: Lindsay Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, allegedly plotting a Valentine's Day mass shooting at the Halifax Shopping Centre . Police in Canada say the three planned to go on a shooting rampage at Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - before committing suicide. Souvannarath and Shepherd were also charged with conspiracy to commit arson, possession of weapons for a dangerous purpose and uttering threats via social media. They were both arrested at Halifax Stanfield International Airport after Souvannarath disembarked her flight from Chicago. Both defendants were stony faced and passive during their court appearance and neither spoke. Judge Brian Gibson told the court to reconvene on April 10 and heard that the pair have not applied for bail. Disheveled: Randall Steven Shepherd arrives at provincial court in Halifax on Friday ahead of his preliminary hearing in April . Indignity: Randall Steven Shepherd puts his hands on the wall to be handcuffed as he arrives in court . Impassive:\u00a0Police say they foiled the alleged plot by three suspects to mark Valentine's Day by killing as many people as possible at the Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - and then committing suicide . Last month, tutors who taught Columbine-obsessed goth, Souvannarath, said she was a disturbed but talented writer. Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.' According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012. Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.' Lindsay Kanittha Souvannarath was charged last month with conspiracy to commit murder. She made a brief court appearance on Friday . Back to jail: Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath leaves at court after a judge informed her and her alleged co-conspirator that their preliminary hearing was next month . No bail: Randall Steven Shepherd leaves court in Halifax on Friday amid tight security after his court appearance on Friday following his arrest on February 13 . Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport. A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea. It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet. Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life. Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility. 'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.' Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house. Lindsay Souvannarath, pictured, from Illinois was allegedly planning a massacre with two online Canadian friends . Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers . Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.' Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges. A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years. The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year. But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Randal Steven Shepherd, pictured, went to the airport to collect Souvanarath who flew up from Illinois . 'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.' Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald. On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters. Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself. 'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.' Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies, . Canadian police said they found three long-barrelled rifles at the home of James Gamble, pictured . James Gamble, pictured, is believed to have shot himself after his house was surrounded by police on Friday . 'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble. In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14. Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.' She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.' Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath. Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself.",

Fed up with staying in and watching TV on her own the 55-year-old, from Enfield, north London, started joining her single daughters on nights on the tiles  - and it wasn't long before she discovered her inner cougar. The pubs and bars were full of men in their 20s and 30s who were looking for a good time just like Gaynor, who refused to accept her sex life was over along with her 20-year marriage. Scroll down for video . Gaynor Evans found herself single when her husband left her for her friend and neighbour next door . After nervously agreeing to a first date with a man young enough to be her son in 2009 Gaynor hasn't looked back. Enjoying up to two dates a week she said she's now addicted to dating toy boys, clocking up hundreds of internet dates. What's more, after years of fad dieting, Gaynor said the energetic sex sessions she enjoys as a result has helped her shed more than two stones of flab and drop from a size 18 to 14. The recruitment manager said: 'When my husband left me I found myself sexually charged but with no one to go to. The only people I knew who were also single were my daughters, who are 37 and 36, so I went out with them. 'I started getting approached by much younger men and I was bemused at first, but then I thought why not? I just wanted to enjoy myself, still have a sex life and be free. I'm making up for lost time and it's liberating.' Gaynor on a night out with her daughter Kate, 36 (left) and on another girls night out with Laura, 37 (right) In a bid to rediscover her lost youth Gaynor wasted no time joining internet dating sites to hunt for younger men, joining specialist websites such as toyboywarehouse.com because many conventional sites don't allow more than a 15-year age gap between clients. She said: 'The youngest guy I've been out with was 20, the same age as my youngest son at the time, and I know I'm older than some of their mothers. There's a huge amount of chemistry between an older woman and a younger guy and the sex has been amazing. 'Toy boys have such stamina. I thought I knew all there is to know about sex until I started seeing younger men. 'I'm not swinging from the chandeliers or anything, but I can find myself lost. I do make a point of only seeing them only once or twice which saves me from getting too attached.' The serial dater also makes a point of not taking her men home for saucy liaisons, where her youngest son still lives. She said: 'I never tell my two boys about these things but the girls are always informed and know what I get up to. Gaynor makes a point of only seeing her toyboys 'once or twice' so she doesn't get too attached . Then and now: Gaynor has shed two stones and dropped two dress sizes since dating younger men . 'I'm a mother first and never take men home when my kids are there, which can make it hard because 95 per cent of them don't have their own places. They house share or still live with their parents so we can't go back to theirs. 'Instead I borrow my daughter's flat during the day when she's at work \u2013 she doesn't mind. I did also use my other daughter's flat once, but she wasn't so happy about it. You can always find somewhere. I duck and dive.' Despite her expert planning \u2013 Gaynor once flew a toy boy in from abroad as her youngest son flew out on holiday - she has been caught out in the past. She said: 'Once I did take a guy home and my son came back when he wasn't supposed to and found me delicately placed. It was very embarrassing.' With hundreds of internet dates under her belt Gaynor decided to self-publish Sex And The Signposts, a racy eBook charting her experiences as an unlikely cougar in August 2012. In the book she details some of her best \u2013 and worst \u2013 dates, as well as her saucy sex sessions. She said: 'I also write a blog about my antics with the same title, but I've saved the naughty stuff for the book. 'There was a hottie I met at the Ascot races who scooped me off my feet and kissed me with a passion \u2013 I'll always remember him \u2013 but other dates weren't so successful. Gaynor has also become an agony aunt for toyboywarehouse.com and regularly dishes out dating advice to younger men. 'There was a date that didn't go so well and afterwards the guy texted me rude pictures of his manhood. It was horrible. Then there was another guy whose stutter was so bad he couldn't speak at all during the date. I got one of my daughters to ring me at a staged moment and pretend there was an emergency. It was squirmingly awful.' Madonna, left, and Demi Moore, right, are both famous for dating younger men . Although she usually only allows herself to see her toyboys once or twice, there have been a couple Gaynor has fallen for. She said: 'Sometime a first date ends in a first date but there have been one or two guys I've fallen in love with. I saw one man on and off for four years but he's moved abroad now, although I'm still in touch with him. 'I feel for them in a way that is measured because I know the relationship can't go anywhere. I kick myself because I know the chance of a long relationship isn't likely \u2013 even after five years I still have that mental barrier. I often wish I was younger.' But Gaynor said there are more pros than cons when it comes to dating younger men. She said: 'There's none of the domestic drudgery you have when you're in a long term relationship and you never fall out. 'When I was younger and dating before I was married you didn't have a very big pool of men to choose from \u2013 there was no internet and you just dated people you knew where you lived. Now the world is your oyster.' 'I feel like I've had a new lease of life. I've dropped from 15 stone to 13 stone through all the sex. I never feel like eating junk food any more and I feel better than ever. 'After six months of dating toyboys I lost half a stone, and when I wasn't having sex I felt sluggish and the weight started creeping back on. Having orgasms is the best diet ever.' 'My mum, who's 91, tuts at me but we can't all be conventional. One of my daughters is always a bit disappointed in my behaviour but the other is hugely supportive and my friends just expect it now.' 'Dating toyboys has been an eye opening experience. When I found out my husband had been having an affair with our neighbour, who was also my friend, for five years I was devastated. The prospect of a lonely life was terrifying and I was scared at what awaited because as an older woman you think your life is over and you're on the scrapheap.' 'I was scared at what awaited me but what I found was amazingly good. I wish I'd found out about my husband's affair sooner. 'I've reinvented myself and now I have a fresh pool to dip my toe \u2013 or my whole body into. I'm proof you can still enjoy your life as an older single woman.'",

        "article": "On Tuesday, she was regal in eye-catching crimson for a state banquet at Buckingham Palace alongside the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Last night saw Mexican First Lady Ang\u00e9lica Rivera on dazzling form for the second day in a row as she dressed up in a floor-length black dress and diamonds for a banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor of London. Ms Rivera, 45, and her husband Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, 48, are currently on a state visit to the UK, which began with a ceremonial welcome at Horse Guards Parade. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: All eyes were on Angelica Rivera as she dazzled in diamonds at a London banquet . All smiles: She joined the Lord Mayor's wife Gilly Yarrow (left) at a banquet hosted by the City of London . There, the glamorous political wife was spotted winking at the royals as she arrived with her husband, before smiling and laughing her way through the ceremony - indulged by an equally cheerful Queen. Ms Rivera, a former soap star, was then squired on a tour of the Royal Collection by a clearly charmed Duke of Edinburgh, with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to Prince Philip during a visit to Mexico in 1975. Her whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of Downton Abbey alongside the Countess of Wessex yesterday, with her husband spending much of the day at Downing Street instead. But it was for the final evening of her stay that Ms Rivera really pulled out all the stops, arriving at London's Guildhall in a spectacular floor-length black dress, teamed with a pair of diamond drop earrings and a matching bracelet. Big arrival: Mexican president\u00a0Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his wife arrive at the London Guildhall . Glamorous: Ms Rivera was chic in a floor-length gown while her husband was dapper in white tie . Striking: Ms Rivera's dress contrasted with the colourful crimson number worn on Tuesday night . For me? Ms Rivera clutches a posy of spring flowers as she processes through the Guildhall . Pretty: Ms Rivera wore her hair in a soft up-do, showing off a pair of dazzling diamond earrings in the process . Matching: Along with her stunning diamond earrings, she wore a pretty diamond bracelet . The banquet, which was hosted by the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Alan Yarrow, and the City of London Corporation, is a state visit tradition, with invitations extended to all visiting heads of state. Ms Rivera, who was presented with a pretty bunch of spring flowers as she arrived, spent much of the evening chatting happily to the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, who were also at the event, and Mrs Gilly Yarrow, the wife of the Lord Mayor. On arrival, the couple were welcomed with a  Royal Salute fired from the cannons at the Tower of London during which a total of 62 shots were fired - the basic 21-gun Royal Salute, plus another 20 because the Tower is a royal palace and a further 21 for the City of London. The Mexican National Anthem was then played and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour before making his way inside. At the end of the banquet, both President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Lord Mayor Yarrow made speeches - in\u00a0President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's case, for the second night in a row. Today will see the presidential couple fly to Aberdeen to meet with Alistair Carmichael, the Secretary of State for Scotland, following a formal farewell from the Queen.

        "article": "A mother left with mounds of overhanging skin after losing 10 stone through a gastric bypass  is begging to have it removed on the NHS so she can find love. Sarah Lord, of Wakefield, was a size 12 before she fell pregnant with her daughter Bryony, now 12. But after her relationship with Bryony's father came to an end four months into her pregnancy, she became depressed and gave into cravings and comfort eating. The 30-year-old was referred for bariatric surgery by her doctor, and went on to lose 10 stone, swapping a diet of fry ups and pies for stir fries and fruit. Sarah Lord, 30, lost 10st after a gastric bypass operation in September 2010, after ballooning to a size 24. She is pictured before (left) and after her weight loss (right), now back to a size 12 . Although she says she feels healthier after losing weight, Miss Lord has been left with a huge flap of excess skin which has ruined her confidence and left her too insecure to attract men or wear a bikini . Miss Lord had become depressed after a break-up four months into her pregnancy, and gained weight after turning to comfort eating (left). After her gastric bypass (right) she changed her diet and began exercising . The procedure has left her with a pouch of saggy skin around her waist, which she says has ruined her confidence and left her unable to attract men. Miss Lord, who works as a team leader for the Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'I've gained a lot of positives, but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending. 'I'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin. I need to get it removed. 'I've asked the NHS for another funded op - now I just need to hear back from my doctor to see if I qualify.' At 16 weeks into her pregnancy, Miss Lord's relationship with her daughter's father broke down. She said: 'The pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough, and the breakup was very upsetting. I fell into a dip of depression, which I coped with through eating.' By the time Bryony was attending her first days at school, Miss Lord had ballooned six dress sizes and gained ten stone, leaving her at 22 stone and size 24. BEFORE . Breakfast: Bacon, egg and sausage sandwich . Lunch: Pie and chips . Dinner: Beef stew with Yorkshire pudding . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Cereal . Lunch: Jacket potato and salad . Dinner: Chicken stir fry with vegetables . Snacks: Fruit and yoghurt . She said: 'I was in and out of hospital for various reasons. As my weight increased I seemed to be more prone to abscesses under my arms and on my bikini line. 'Friends thought I was bubbly and outgoing, but inside I was finding things really difficult. 'Whenever I found myself in an argument with anyone, my size was the first thing they would pick on, and it really hurt when they did. 'As people used harsh names, I became more and more reclusive.' Her depression reached such a state that she was recommended a course of antidepressants by her GP, but she decided against relying on drugs to improve her mood. Eventually, her doctor suggested that a NHS gastric bypass would combat her mounting health problems and attack the route cause of her depression. After an assessment she underwent the procedure at Dewsbury and District Hospital in September 2010. She said: 'Before the bypass I'd tried to lose weight in the gym, but nothing had ever worked. 'The weight loss after the operation was unbelievable. I lost eight stone in a year, and a further two the year after that. 'Instead of spending my evenings gorging on food I got involved in some intense boot camps at my local gym. There were moments after a heavy session where I could barely walk. 'I was exercising five times a week and the pounds were melting away.' Miss Lord, pictured part way through her weight loss (left), and now that she has lost 10 stone (right) says her excess skin has left her less confident than when she was overweight . She also completely overhauled her diet, further accelerating her weight loss. Before her operation, she typically ate a greasy bacon, egg and sausage sarnie for breakfast, followed by pie and chips for lunch. In the evenings she would tuck into comfort food like beef stew with Yorkshire puddings. She snacked on crisps and chocolate throughout the day. After the bypass, she enjoyed cereal for breakfast, followed by jacket potato and salad for lunch. For her evening meal she typically made chicken stir-fry with plenty of vegetables. When she snacks today, she indulges on fruit and yoghurt. While her physical appearance and general health improved, she found her confidence dipping. She said: 'There's absolutely no question about whether or not I feel healthier, but whether or not I feel more confident, that's a whole different story. 'In the past I was confident enough to meet up with men after meeting them on a night out, but I wouldn't do it again. I don't feel comfortable with my loose skin. 'Now whenever I find myself talking to a man at a bar I always make an excuse to leave early. I tend to just say \"I'm with someone else\". 'When I'm on holiday I'll always wear a modest swimsuit. I never wear anything tight around my stomach area.' Miss Lord is happy to be healthier after the gastric bypass, but desperately wants the NHS to remove the excess skin. Such a procedure would cost around \u00a315,000 at a private clinic . She is now waiting for a green light from NHS bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline. The cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around \u00a315,000. She said: 'My GP has tried to get me funding for the operation four times but every time it has been denied. 'This is my fifth application for the saggy skin removal op so I am really hoping that I am eligible this time.' Despite her struggles with low confidence, Miss Lord said she has gained a lot of positives. She said: 'I feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter Bryony looks up to me. I wouldn't want her to end up like how I did.' After weight loss, proteins in skin tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength . Losing weight is the answer to many people's prayers. But they may not\u00a0realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin. This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength. When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength. Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract. It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain. Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy \u2014 but all over the body. Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had. Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs. This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems. One of the most common is intertrigo - a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery.",

        "article": "New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley . The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain . 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat . Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed. Since the disorder is genetic, her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it. The more the disease is in the public eye, the more physicians are aware of it, she said, and it'll be more likely the federal government would fund research. 'I am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who (like) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat, with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy,' she said. 'The idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat-like properties would certainly be very interesting for them.' Sales of gluten-free products in the United States increaed last year, reaching $973million in 2014, up from $810million in 2013 .",

Wading neck deep through thick brown gloop, these intrepid athletes were clearly relishing the challenge of one the World's muddiest running races - the annual 10K Muddy Trials. The event, which take place in\u00a0the  grounds of Craufurdland Castle in Fenwick, Scotland, was first held in 2012 and has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most gruelling races in the cross country calendar.

Dirty business: A runner keeps her spirits up flashing a few v-signs despite being chest-deep in thick, heavy gloop . Struggle: A racer grits her teeth as she drags herself on hands and knees through the gruelling Muddy Trials course . Two mud-coated contestants clearly enjoy the conditions as they take part in the event which attracts runners from all over Britain . Described by the organisers as 'very, very muddy', the course takes in almost impenetrable ditches and gruelling trails through thick forest and unforgving bog. Racers must first cross fields and make their way through dense woodland after which they ford several streams before plunging waist deep through dark gooey ditches and dragging the,selves towards the finish line. Conditions are so bad that before they set off, runners are advised to tape their shoes to their feet with industrial-strength gaffer tape to stop them getting stuck and coming off in the mud. But anyone can take part with a less demanding but similarly muddy 5km course available alongside the 10km course, and even a 'Muddy Mile' short course for youngsters. Some runners even brought along the pets dogs. Bog hoppers: The trials were first held in 2012 and have quickly gained a reputation as one of the heaviest-going races in the cross country calendar .

        "article": "(CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made news this week when he told CNN's Dana Bash that he would get his health care through Obamacare. Previously, Cruz's family was covered under his wife's policy through her employer, the investment bank Goldman Sachs. But with her husband's presidential candidacy underway, Heidi Cruz has taken a leave without pay. So she has lost her Goldman Sachs health benefits. The story went viral, in part because Cruz once engineered a partial government shutdown to try to kill Obamacare. As part of his crusade, Cruz conducted a 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor, during which he read Dr. Seuss' classic \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" Spoiler alert: \"Green Eggs and Ham\" ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it. Now that Cruz is likely to try Obamacare, my guess is he will have a similar experience. So, with apologies to Dr. Seuss -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme \"President Bar\" with \"Obamacare\" -- here is my updated version of \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" President BarPresident BarI do not likethat President Bar .

When she found the ring on the marsupial's collar, however, she was speechless. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to Jessica Harrington, 22, on March 7 in Summit Township, near Jackson. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Harrington, 22, with the help of a baby kangaroo on March 7 in Summit Township, Michigan . He hid the ring on the kangaroo's collar, which he made several references to before Harrington noticed. When she did, Day got down on one knee and she was left speechless . The couple have been together for five-and-a-half years, have a three-year-old son named Payton and have been talking about marriage for the last year. 'It kind of took my breath away,' Harrington told MLive about Day's surprise proposal. The couple plan to wed on October 31 of this year. In a video that captured the proposal, Day makes several references to the kangaroo's collar being too tight before Harrington spotted the ring. Saying the collar was to tight was simply a ruse to get Harrington to find the ring and there was no animal cruelty involved, according to the New York Daily News. 'You missed it like 20 times,' Day said after he got down on one knee. Harrington said yes and was visibly overwhelmed with emotion. Day and Harrington have been dating for five-and-a-half years and have a three-year-old son named Payton together. They've been talking about marriage for the last year, but Harrington didn't know when Day would get down on one knee . A friend of the couple is attempting to start a small zoo and recently came across the baby kangaroo, named Boomer. Harrington fell in love with the animal when she spend a few months in Australia when she was 13 years old and was touched by her fiance's special gesture. 'The fact that he used something so special to me from my past brought back a lot of happy memories and he used that for a day that will be one of the biggest days of our lives,' she said. To add another personal touch to the proposal, Day used some familiar stones in Harrington's engagement ring. 'He actually used a stone from my mom's old ring and a stone from his mom's old ring so that made it even more special than what it already was,' Harrington said.",
