        "article": "A British solicitor and former Mayor of Glastonbury has been revealed as a key prosecutor of the evil camp guards of Bergen-Belsen after its liberation in 1945 . Cecil Hamilton-Miller, from Kensington, London, was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards in 1945, including several key Belsen figures, such as camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. Mr Hamilton-Miller, who died in 2001, aged 91, struggled to talk to about the horrors he witnessed during the holocaust or the role he played after the liberation of Belsen, his family has said today. Hero: Cecil Hamilton-Miller, pictured as Mayor of Glastonbury, was part of the team that prosecuted dozens of the men and women responsible for running the notorious Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp . Cecil Hamilton-Miller can be seen on the right, watching on as Bergen-Belsen camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial in 1945 . Despite his honourable actions in the wake of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, which took place 70 years ago this month, many family and friends had no idea of his involvement. A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945 . Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners, . The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969. After his wife's death Cecil moved to family in Norwich before his death in 2001 aged 91.",

        "article": "A man who murdered a mother and daughter in their own home by bludgeoning them with a hammer and repeatedly stabbing them with scissors will spend at least 32 years behind bars. Lesley Jonathon Cameron was jailed for life on Tuesday for the horrific December 2013 murder of Maureen Anne Horstman, 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman in broad daylight at their Warwick home, in Perth, WA. Cameron, who was 19 and at the time, also raped Tamara but it is not known if she was alive or dead. A used condom with DNA evidence was found after the incident,\u00a0The West Australian Supreme Court heard. Maureen Anne Horstman (left), 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman (right) were bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed to death with scissors in their own home in December 2013 . Prosecutor James MacTaggart said Cameron's behaviour was 'sadistic' and he went on a 'killing spree'. 'It's violence for violence's sake,' he said. Mr MacTaggart said while it may have started out as a burglary, Cameron was aroused and then 'sexually violated' Tamara. The court heard Cameron first entered Tamara's bedroom where he hit her over the head twice before going into Maureen's bedroom and striking her once to the head. He then returned to Tamara's bedroom and raped her. Lesley Jonathon Cameron has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years for the horrific crime. He described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' Cameron's lawyer Dominic Brunello said it was an unplanned and chaotic attack and Cameron panicked. Mr Brunello said his client had a troubled childhood and was 'drug-addled' at the time but was now sorry. 'He makes no excuses for his conduct,' Mr Brunello said. The court heard Cameron described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' and that he told police he had taken ice and speed. Justice Eric Heenan noted Cameron had a criminal record that was 'virtually without interruption' since he was 10 years old. In a victim impact statement, Tamara's twin brother Nicholas Horstman, who discovered the bodies, said his sister was a dedicated student, loyal friend and widely loved. Maureen and Tamara are seen here in a family photo with Tamara's twin brother Nicholas.\u00a0Tamara's father said he has suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked' He and his father accepted Tamara's university graduation certificate the day after her funeral. Tamara's father said he suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked'. Justice Heenan said the women were going about their lives peacefully at home and the crime showed the vulnerability of the community. 'This is one of the worst types of murders one can imagine,' he said. 'It is the kind of offence which every member of the population dreads because it shows the insecurity and vulnerability of everybody in the community to random crime,' he added. Justice Heenan noted there was a possibility Cameron would remain a threat if he did not address his mental health and substance abuse issues. He said just because Cameron was young did not make him any less dangerous but there was a possibility of rehabilitation. Outside court, Nicholas Horstman said he was very happy with the sentence. 'However, no sentence will ever be long enough,' he said. 'To my family, close friends and the wider community, thank you for your support over the last 16 months. I'm truly thankful.'",

        "article": "A former Florida State University student has filed a lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, claiming he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012. The lawsuit by Erica Kinsman, which seeks damages from the former Seminoles quarterback, was filed two weeks before the April 30 NFL draft. Winston could be selected as the first overall pick. Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013. He also was cleared by the university following a two-day student conduct hearing last year. The hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. Scroll down for video . Former Florida State University student Erica Kinsman filed a civil lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, saying he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012 . Former FSU quarterback and Heisman winner Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013 . But John Clune, a lawyer for Kinsman, said in a statement there are consequences for Winston's behavior 'and since others have refused to hold him accountable, our client will.' 'Erica hopes to show other survivors the strength and empowerment that can come from refusing to stay silent no matter what forces are against you,' Clune said. December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker. January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name. November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. He added: 'Jameis Winston in contrast has proven time and time again to be an entitled athlete who believes he can take what he wants. 'He took something here that he was not entitled to and he hurt someone. Kinsman told her alleged sexual assault story publicly in a documentary titled The Hunting Ground,\u00a0which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's, according to the Daily Beast. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told the pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman claims that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, although she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her, penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room, when they told him to stop. He then took her into the bathroom, Kinsman said. There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her, 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. Kinsman's lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress . Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. The lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress. Because the burden of proof is much lower in a civil lawsuit than in a criminal case, Kinsman could have a better chance of winning a jury verdict if it goes to trial. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said in a civil case the standard amounts to the 'greater weight' of the evidence, or 'merely tipping the scales in favor of the plaintiff.' In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove a person's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning jurors must be entirely convinced of guilt. Kinsman dropped out of FSU after the incident, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston . A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . 'The scales have to be tipped all the way over to the side of the prosecution,' said Weinstein, who is not involved in the case. Weinstein also said that he thought Kinsman's chances of prevailing were good, based on the detailed allegations and multiple witness statements in the lawsuit. But that doesn't mean it will be easy. 'The defense will drag her character through the mud, so this is going to be an unpleasant process for her,' he said. 'However, Winston has a lot to lose, so I foresee a settlement and not a trial.' Kinsman has also filed a lawsuit against FSU's trustees, asserting that university officials had knowledge of her alleged sexual harassment and discrimination by the star quarterback and this created a hostile educational environment for her. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including reimbursement for tuition, damages for emotional pain and suffering and loss of past and present earning and earning capacity. Lawyers for the university's board of trustees contend the lawsuit should be dismissed because it does not show that FSU was responsible for her harassment, but they also maintain that they offered her assistance. Kinsman's story was featured in the documentary film The Hunting Ground, which is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations .",

        "article": "KFC opened up their kitchens to skeptics and fans alike on Saturday and there were no mutant chickens to be seen, the deep fryer was as clean as a whistle and the salad was crisp. It was no-doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world's biggest fast food chains that it isn't all bad, but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 KFC outlets in Australia are, the food they make just isn't good for you. The franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks, in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there's nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . KFC\u00a0allowed hundreds of people to tour the back of 219 stores across Australia and roam from freezer to fryer on Saturday . The fast food giant hoped to dispel myths around the quality and freshness of their ingredients and prove their chicken was fresh and cooked in the kitchen of each store . 'They'll see exactly what happens, we haven't airbrushed anything,' Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC, told Daily Mail Australia. 'They'll see exactly how it's done, they'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we've got, they'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer.' Ms Lawson said the fast food giant hoped to dispel 'blanket perceptions' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients. 'It's not something that's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it,' she said. 'If you look at the ingredients and processes we use, it's actually like fabulous home cooked food, and it's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen.' Daily Mail Australia attended an earlier tour of the KFC store outside Sydney's Airport in Mascot, alongside four couples who had registered as skeptics and fans . In one of two\u00a0cool rooms, selections of raw chicken were seen packed in boxes marked with use by dates and the type of cut: whole chickens, zingers cuts, wings etc. A senior cook was then seen flouring and seasoning batches of the selections by hand, before distributing them between one of the six fryers .

However everything else in the kitchen was delivered in boxes: chips, nuggets and popcorn chicken were stored in another of the cool rooms, fresh vegetables are delivered pre-cut in bags and bread is also delivered from a bakery and stored in boxes. A store manager confirmed that the gravy was made from a combination of the run off from chicken cooked in the store and packets of potato. However everything else in the kitchen was delivered in boxes: chips, nuggets and popcorn chicken were stored in another of the cool rooms, fresh vegetables are delivered pre-cut in bags and bread is also delivered from a bakery and stored in boxes . The skeptics on tour with Daily Mail Australia expressed their surprise and approval at KFC's high standard of hygiene, including the two coloured handles fitted on each of the cool room doors - red for hands that had touched raw chicken and silver for those that hadn't - as well as multiple sinks. However Alexandra Jones from The George Institute for Global Health warned consumers not to equate KFC's attempt to build customer trust through displaying respectable food safety standards and their message of 'freshness', with healthiness. 'Regardless of the freshness of the chicken, KFC's biggest selling products are still prepared in a manner that leaves them high in things like fat and salt,' Ms Jones told Daily Mail Australia. 'We would encourage attempts by KFC to increase the transparency of their operations and provide interested customers with an insight into how their food is prepared. At the same time, it's important not to pretend that this is about the healthiness of KFC's range.

'Regardless of the freshness of the chicken, KFC's biggest selling products are still prepared in a manner that leaves them high in things like fat and salt,' Ms Jones told Daily Mail Australia . 'KFC is still in the business of deriving profits from fried chicken, which is provided free to tour participants. 'We'd like to see KFC demonstrating innovation in progressively reducing salt, sugar and fat from its products together with other initiatives like restricting portion sizes and continuing to offer healthier options in the product range.' Each of the skeptics invited to the Mascot store's back-of-house claimed to have had their minds changed by the tour. 'It is much fresher than I ever expected it would be. I thought the chicken was frozen and it was actual fresh chicken\u2026 there was pieces of cut up chicken; soft, squishy, real, fresh chicken, even with feathers,' Melissa Graham, 35, told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was really good to see all the hygiene standards that they've got, especially the hold times for the chicken [20 to 90 minutes] and the checking of the chicken so they make sure its cooked every morning,' Nic Wittison, 26, said. 'It's always hard to tell whether the people that work actually care enough to follow all the procedures, but they have quite detailed things like how many times you have to shake the chicken [when flouring].

        "article": "Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with\u00a0Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Scroll down for video . Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network . Customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls, send texts and use data as part of their plan, regardless of where in the world they are. In particular, a deal with Hutchison would extend the service to the UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain., but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on Google's plan. Last week Three extending its Feel at Home scheme to Spain and New Zealand. Feel at Home lets Three customers use their phones, and their plans, in the same way they can at home even when they're in a foreign country. Spain and New Zealand take the total number of Feel at Home countries to 18. The other nations include France, Switzerland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Australia, Finland, Indonesia, Macau, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home that lets customers use their phones and their plans in 18  countries. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. \u2018You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,\u2019 said the 43-year-old. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home (pictured) that lets customers use their phones and their plans for free, in 18 countries. Spain and New Zealand were the latest countries to join this scheme . A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2\u2019s, and ultimately Telefonica\u2019s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service . This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2\u2019s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: \u2018We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.\u2019 He described the plans as a \u2018project\u2019 and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber. Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai (pictured) confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.\u00a0Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing networks and sell connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate . Travelex has launched a 'Supercard' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past. Based on an average 10-day holiday, Travelex told MailOnline a family of four could save almost \u00a3110. The Supercard looks and works like a standard debit card, but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account. The banking fees are paid for by Travelex and savings are shown in real-time. And if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (\u00a342) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google\u2019s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.",

        "article": "A Labour government would take action to enforce a Premier League commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport, the party has said. Shadow health secretary and keen football fan Andy Burnham said the move could unlock \u00a3400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament. And he said Labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects. Andy Burnham (left) and Ed Miliband promise that Labour will make the Premier League invest in grassroots . Mr Burnham accused Prime Minister David Cameron of failing to get tough on the Premier League despite a massive increase in its TV revenues during his time in power. Although the league puts \u00a3168million into grassroots sport, this represents only a fraction of the \u00a35billion it has taken in from TV deals between 2013 and 2016, said Labour. Mr Burnham said: 'The last Labour government secured a commitment from the Premier League that five per cent of all TV income should be invested in the grassroots. 'Since then, TV rights have soared by over 160 per cent, but David Cameron has failed to make sure that the game's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through. David Cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the Premier League . 'Football at grassroots is struggling and, in many cities, Premier League stadia loom over run-down changing rooms and overgrown pitches. The gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider. 'Premier League clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest. That is why a Labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the Premier League owes is paid in full, unlocking an estimated \u00a3400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament.' Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford added: 'We will get tough and under Labour's better plan we will make sure the Premier League lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots. This will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports.' BT Sport and Sky Sports were part of the lucrative TV deal estimated around \u00a35billion starting in 2016 . A Premier League spokesman said: 'The success of the Premier League benefits the development of the English game outside of the top flight. Significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards, and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005. 'Only last month Premier League clubs committed to investing at least \u00a31bn outside of the league from 2016-2019. That will mean even more investment in grass-roots football. 'Currently we invest \u00a356m per season in this important work and Premier League football will generate over \u00a31.2bn in tax revenue for the Treasury this year alone.

        "article": "Teachers are set to call for 'play in the curriculum' for schoolchildren up to seven as this is more suitable than educating them in a formal way. Many children are not ready to sit down and do  reading, writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). At its annual conference in Harrogate, it will say\u00a0schools should follow the lead of countries like Finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute play times. Teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills . They want the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Finland which has 15 minute play time after lessons . It is also likely to say lunch and break times are being used for 'coaching and cramming', depriving youngsters of their 'fundamental human right to play' with their classmates. A resolution due to be put forward at the conference says: 'Primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way.' It goes on to suggest learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that 'over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school'. The motion calls on the NUT to support play in the curriculum at Key Stage 1 (five to seven-year-olds) 'to reflect the needs of the children'. Speaking ahead of the conference, NUT general secretary Christine Blower said many children are not ready for the 'formal sitting down' and 'come on let's do some work stage'' before they are seven. 'There is a question about whether we're expecting children to do things they're not developmentally ready for,' she said. The resolution, set to be heard on Saturday, also says: 'Lunchtime and break times are being used for coaching and cramming sessions, thus depriving primary age children of their fundamental human right to play and have free time to socialise with their peers.' The motion calls on the NUT to support play  for five to seven-year-olds 'to reflect the needs of the children' The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says children have the right to play and rest, it adds. Ms Blower said: 'In Finland, there are 45-minute lessons and then they have a break. Between each teaching session they have a break. One thing about our children is that, relatively speaking, they are rushed from pillar to post. Not so much in primary school, but in secondary school. 'Having a break between lessons gives a bit of space to reflect on the lesson they've just had.' The motion calls on the NUT to campaign in England and Wales for new laws to ensure children have a right to appropriate breaks and lunchtimes. The resolution comes amid growing debate over what children should learn, with politicians and education experts increasingly calling for schools to teach values such character, teamwork and resilience alongside academic subjects.",

        "article": "Cannabis can kill cancer cells and helps shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumour, new advice reveals . Cannabis can kill cancer cells and shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumours, new advice reveals. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the US has admitted, in its revised publication on marijuana, that the drug offers benefits to some cancer patients. The report states: 'Recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others. 'Evidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from whole-plant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumours. 'Research in mice showed that these extracts, when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.' The term medicinal marijuana refers to using the whole unprocessed plant or its basic extracts to treat a disease or symptom. Currently the drug is not recognised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medicine. However, studies of the chemicals in marijuana - cannabinoids - has led the FDA to approve two medications that contain cannabinoid chemicals. Currently two cannabinoids, of around 100, are of medical interest - THC and CBD. THC increases appetite and reduces nausea. It may also decrease pain, inflammation and muscle control problems. CBD is a cannabinoid that does not affect the mind or behaviour. It is thought to be useful in minimising pain and inflammation, controlling epileptic seizures and possibly treating mental illness and addictions. In the UK, THC is the active ingredient in the prescribed drug Sativex. It is currently only licensed to treat and relive the pain of muscle spasms in MS patients. Scroll down for video . The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the US has admitted, in its revised publication on marijuana, that the drug offers benefits to some cancer patients, including those suffering some brain tumours, pictured . Scientists are also conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies into the effects of marijuana on: . The new advice from the National Institute on Drug Abuse comes as a group of senators put pressure on the US federal government to recognise the medicinal value of the drug. Medication containing cannabinoids, from marijuana, is licensed to treat MS - pictured on a brain scan - patients in both the US and UK . The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act was introduced in March. It proposes moving cannabis from a schedule I to a schedule II drug, recognising it has some medicinal value. The proposed bill does not, however, legalise marijuana in all states, but permits states to set their own policies, the Daily Caller reported. 'It couldn\u2019t be any clearer that marijuana has medical value,' Tom Angell, chairman of the Marijuana Majority, told The Daily Caller. 'When even NIDA and the surgeon general are acknowledging that marijuana can help people who are suffering, it is time for the Obama administration to reschedule the drug. 'The attorney general can initiate that process today, and there\u2019s no reason for him not to, especially when polling shows that such a huge majority of Americans supports medical marijuana.' Twenty-three states in the US currently have laws legalising the use of marijuana in some form. Four states - Colorado, Alaska, Oregon and Washington - have legalised the drug for both medicinal and recreational use. Meanwhile, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Hawaii and Maine have laws allowing people to use the drug for medicinal purposes.",

        "article": "Flying for business or pleasure is one of the most thrilling experiences in the world, but it remains full of mystery for the average traveller. Curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane \u2013 from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long-haul flights. MailOnline Travel spoke to a number of experts to debunk some of the myths that exist and answer some of travellers\u2019 frequently asked questions about planes. Scroll down for video . Once a pilot initiates the sequence to start a modern plane, the remaining steps are done automatically . How do pilots start a plane? It\u2019s not as simple as turning a key or pushing a single button. Starting a plane is \u2018a little more complicated\u2019 than starting a car, said Captain Piers Applegarth, a representative of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA). The retired training captain said an air start motor rotates the jet engines before adding fuel and starting the ignition. He said: \u2018This means that there are a few levers and buttons that need to be moved. On modern aircraft, most of this is done automatically once the start sequence is initiated but a pilot can still start it manually.\u2019 Flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all . Is the crew served the same food as passengers? If meals are provided by the airline, pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy. To reduce the risk of food poisoning, the captain and co-pilot usually eat different meals, said Mr Applegarth. Like passengers, the flight crew can bring their own food on board, but the meals provided to them are the same or variations of the meals provided to passengers in business class. Caterers will sometimes load meals designated specifically for the crew, said Patrick Smith, a pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential. He said: \u2018At my airline we are given a menu prior to departure and will write down our entree preferences \u2013 first choice, plus at least one alternate. \u2018Eating in the cockpit can be messy, so on international flights I usually take my meals in the cabin, on my rest break. \u2018With potential illness in mind, pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees, but this is not a hard and fast rule. In practice it comes to down to your preferences and what\u2019s available.\u2019 Flight attendant Sarah Steegar, who works for a major US airline, said if \u2013 \u2018and that\u2019s a big if\u2019 \u2013 an airline provides food to cabin crew it will be the same food that is served to passengers. But it\u2019s rare for some airlines to provide meals to flight attendants on flights under 12 hours, she added. \u2018If there are meals left over we can have that. Many of us try to bring our own food, but it\u2019s a challenge, considering periods of time with no refrigerators and different liquid restrictions and customs laws. \u2018Fun fact: the UK is the most difficult when it comes to trying to bring food for ourselves.\u2019 The Airbus A350 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long-haul flights . Where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo? Planes that fly long-haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew, said Mr Applegarth. In other cases pilots try to catch some shut-eye in special rest seats allocated for them within or near the cockpit, or within the passenger cabin, he added. Mr Applegarth said: \u2018Generally flights less than about 10 hours and 30 minutes only carry two pilots. For longer flights extra pilots are carried so that each pilot can have a chance to sleep and be rested for the landing.\u2019 The Airbus A380, which is the world\u2019s largest passenger airliner, has private sleeping quarters below its decks which flight attendants use for rest. Mr Smith said: \u2018Flight attendants also work in shifts, and similarly to the pilots their rest quarters can either be a designated block of cabin seats or a separate room somewhere. \u2018Many flight attendant rest quarters are located in the far aft of the plane, above or below the main deck, and can accommodate six or more cabin crew simultaneously.\u2019 When nature calls, flight and cabin crew on most planes use the same toilets as passengers. The Boeing 747, the original jumbo jet, has a lavatory just for pilots. Prior to any flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty . What happens if a toilet\u2019s tank fills up? The toilets cannot be emptied in the sky, so that means all of the human waste is stored on board until the plane lands and a ground crew empties the tanks. \u2018If the toilet becomes full then it is out of action and the flight attendants block out the toilet so it can't be used,\u2019 said Mr Applegarth. Prior to any long-haul flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty, Mr Smith added. He said: \u2018It seldom happens, but if a particular lavatory tank fills or overflows en route, that lav will be closed off. It's extremely unusual for all of the lavs to become unusable \u2013 a serious situation that could result in the flight being diverted.\u2019 Pilots monitor multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots about turbulence . Do commercial pilots communicate with other pilots during a flight? Mr Applegarth said pilots are always monitoring multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots who are in the air. He said: \u2018We are always listening out on one frequency that air traffic are using and we use another radio tuned to a special frequency to listen out for aircraft which may have an emergency. \u2018We also have a chat frequency that we can use to share information such as turbulence.\u2019 The amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather . How much jet fuel is required? A jet engine typically burns about 2,400 pounds (approximately 1,100 litres) of fuel per hour, with planes carrying a lot more fuel than required for the individual trip. Mr Applegarth said: \u2018For a flight we load an amount of fuel that is the sum of the fuel needed to fly the route, an extra amount added for contingency \u2013 for instance, in case we have to hold \u2013 some extra fuel so that we could divert to another airfield and we also have to land with a minimum amount of fuel even if we used all the fuel just mentioned. \u2018So after a flight we always have a minimum of fuel on board. On top of this, pilots can also decide to add extra fuel for each trip if they think it will be needed above and beyond that above.\u2019 Mr Smith said the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather. A Boeing 767 on a flight from London to New York would burn about 75,000 pounds of jet fuel (34,020 litres), while a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380 might use twice that amount, he said. Condensation trails are similar to the fog that results when a person exhales on a cold day . Why do planes leave long white trails in the sky? These condensation trails form when humid exhaust from jet engines cools very quickly in colder and dryer air at higher altitudes. Mr Smith said: \u2018It's not unlike the fog that results when you exhale on a cold day. In other words, contrails are clouds. \u2018Water vapour, strange as it might seem, is a by-product of the combustion within jet engines, which is where the humidity comes from.\u2019 'Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open' a plane door in mid-air, said one expert . What would happen if a plane\u2019s door suddenly opened mid-flight? This ranks among passengers\u2019 biggest fears, but Mr Applegarth said it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside. He said: \u2018This means the door is being forced closed. Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open it.\u2019 Mr Smith added: \u2018In addition to any mechanical latching, most aircraft doors open inward before they open outward, and like a drain plug they are held in place by the forces of the pressurised cabin. \u2018If a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression, though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one.\u2019 Margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin, said pilot and author Patrick Smith . How much money does an airline pocket from each ticket sale? A recent Travelzoo study found that British Airways\u2019 profit margin for each \u00a3690 ticket it sold for a flight from London to New York was just \u00a34.24, accounting for 0.61 per cent of the overall cost. Almost the entire cost of the return flight went towards taxes, surcharges and operating costs. Mr Smith said budget airlines probably make nothing from their super-cheap promotional fares, and margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin. \u2018Margins on a premium-class long-haul fare costing thousands of pounds, on the other hand, will be much higher,\u2019 he said.",

        "article": "The owner of the Mystic Pizza restaurant made famous in a 1988 movie has pleaded guilty to federal tax charges. The U.S. Attorney's Office says 48-year-old John Zelepos of North Stonington faces up to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to tax evasion and financial structuring offenses. The restaurant owner may also be forced to pay a $500,000 fine. Prosecutors said in a release that between 2006 and 2010, Zelepos diverted just over $567,000 from Mystic Pizza's gross receipts into his personal bank accounts and those of family members. They say he then filed false tax returns to hide the income. Owner: Mystic Pizza owner John Zelepos (seen here in 2008) has pleaded guilty to federal tax charges . On the big screen: The 1988 movie 'Mystic Pizza,' starring (from left to right) Annabeth Gish, Lili Taylor and Julia Roberts, focused on three waitresses working at the pizza restaurant . Prosecutors said he's agreed to paying $234,407 in restitution over the tax returns along with interest and penalties. They also said that Zelepos is going to forfeit funds he put in accounts in an attempt to skip currency transaction reports (CTRs), which come to $522,658. 'Federal law requires all financial institutions to file a CTR for currency transactions that exceed $10,000,' the release said. 'To evade the filing of a CTR, individuals will often structure their currency transactions so that no single transaction exceeds $10,000.' Prosecutors said in the release that Zelepos made deposits 'ranging from $3,000 to $9,998 on sequential days or multiple cash deposits on the same day.' They said Zelepos made deposits under $10,000 on purpose to skip the reports. A slice of heaven: The famed 'Mystic Pizza' opened in 1973. Its owner, John Zelepos, has pleaded guilty to\u00a0tax evasion and financial structuring offenses . Sensation: Mystic Pizza (seen in 2008) has become a tourist attraction since Julia Roberts starred in the movie about the lives of three waitresses working at the small-town pizza parlor . Zelepos will actually forfeit $459,573.51 since the IRS earlier seized $63,084.49, prosecutors said. 'Our voluntary system of self-reported tax liability depends upon people to honestly report their income and pay their taxes,' U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly said in the release. Daly added 'Those who willfully hide their income and purposefully evade paying their taxes steal from the public and damage our nation\u2019s system of taxation. 'Violators will be prosecuted, punished, and obligated to repay their taxes along with applicable penalties and interest.' The Hartford Courant reported the restaurant was previously required to pay $105,000 to 110 workers for failing to pay them mandatory overtime and paying them under minimum wage. The famed pizza restaurant opened in 1973, according to Mystic Pizza's website. Mystic Pizza became a tourist attraction after Julia Roberts starred in the movie about the lives of three waitresses working at the small-town pizza parlor. Zelepos is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23.",

        "article": "(CNN)The nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here: . Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old \"brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets.\" The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's testimony, the testimony of Hernandez's fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court . OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? It's the Windy City's first runoff for a citywide office, and it's being billed as a battle for the \"future of Chicago.\" In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February's general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote . Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.",

        "article": "The other day I was driving past the port at Bristol and I saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside \u2013 and whoa\u2026 I did a double take. There they were: phalanx upon phalanx of shiny new vehicles glinting like Dinky toys in the sun; and I suddenly realised that they weren\u2019t arriving in this country. These cars hadn\u2019t just disembarked from France or Germany or Japan. They were about to make their own journey overseas \u2013 they were British cars, for goodness sake. They were examples of British manufacturing and design and engineering \u2013 and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other European countries, and to Africa, and Asia; and I reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country. Scroll down for video . Britain last year produced more than 1.5 million cars \u2013 the most since 2007 \u2013 and we are poised to overtake France and become the second biggest car manufacturing power in Europe. Across the West Midlands \u2013 and indeed across the country \u2013 there are now literally thousands of businesses, large and small, that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply; and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible. I remember the 1970s. You, too, may remember that mullet- haired decade. The music was superb, the food was mediocre, and British industry was on its knees. I remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of \u2018conveners\u2019 and \u2018shop stewards\u2019, and when the man who ran British Leyland \u2013 then our biggest car company \u2013 appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called Red Robbo. When I was a child I am afraid to say that British cars were the butt of international derision. They leaked oil, and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off. Lemon after lemon rolled off our production lines, culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the Austin Allegro \u2013 and there was a reason for the disaster. Boris Johnson: The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s . We had atrocious relations between management and unions, and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions. We had a Labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market, or the desires of their customers \u2013 but to satisfy the rights of their workers. We had an era of tea breaks and \u2018demarcation disputes\u2019 and closed shops and one-out-all-out strikes, with the Labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as Tony Benn\u2019s communist-style motorbike \u2018collective\u2019 at Meriden. It did not work then, and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now. I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone, who has long been on the Bennite wing. By Ed Miliband\u2019s own admission, Livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking \u2013 and in their return to the Benn/Livingstone approach Labour\u2019s plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise. Miliband is turning the Labour Party sharply back to the Left, and actively repudiating the chief insight of Tony Blair \u2013 that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy. That is why British business people are so unanimous in their horror, including many former Labour supporters and donors. They are not wrong. Labour wants to hit small- and medium- sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance \u2013 but it is worse than that. 'I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone' They want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s, in which management was deprived of the ability to manage. They want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals \u2013 when you might think the system was already out of control, with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination. They want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profit-sharing \u2013 a return to Bennery \u2013 and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers. That is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the City, higher income tax, and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with \u2013 the result of Labour\u2019s failure to tackle the deficit. What makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the British motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms. We are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies \u2013 firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreen-wiper or a quieter air-conditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia. It is incredible but true that Britain now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth \u2013 Lotus, McLaren, Bristol, Morgan, Caterham, TVR\u2026 the list goes on. Think of London\u2019s new hop-on hop-off Routemaster bus, a glorious piece of low-carbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market \u2013 made in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus. The West Midlands is once again the epicentre of one of the world\u2019s densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development. British brands have shed their 1970s reputations; they are taking on the world and winning. How mad, how tragic, that this extraordinary British triumph should be faced with a Labour government that regards capitalism as \u2018predatory\u2019. The problem with Ed Miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie \u2013 in fact I totally sympathise on that one. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s, writes Boris Johnson . The problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time, though he did. He and Balls were at the controls in Downing Street when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory \u2013 a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s. He genuinely thinks France is the model we should emulate, when the French \u2013 whatever the splendours of their civilisation \u2013 have 12 per cent unemployment, and when huge numbers of the most talented French people have decided that they wish France was more like Britain. How many Brits work in Paris? 16,000. How many French men and women live and work in London? About 400,000. Mais oui. That should tell Miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies. Labour wants to go back to the 1970s, Ukip to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s, the Greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age, and the Lib Dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country, and that has a plan to take it forward. The Lib Dems under Nick Clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls . It is only the Conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those British cars lined up at Bristol. They aren\u2019t the results of an evil and predatory system, by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege. They are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which Britain has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete, and that we cannot hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that Ed Miliband is proposing. Those British-made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the Labour-made disaster of 2008-9, in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars; an economy that has seen the creation, since 2010, of about two million jobs. And those glistening British cars at the Bristol docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation \u2013 because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare \u2013 not to speak of strong defences \u2013 and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet. I really don\u2019t think Miliband gets that. He is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried; and I am horrified at the idea he should be given another go. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow is going to be better than today. That is David Cameron and the Conservatives. We need five more years to entrench this economic recovery, five years to take this country forwards and not backwards. That is the Battle for Britain next month, and one this country can\u2019t afford to lose.",

        "article": "Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story\u00a0is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019 The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'",

Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune\u00a0reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men. Remains of two handymen who had been living on Monica's 20-acre pig ranch (pictured) in Jackson County, Oregon were found in 2014 after she was caught using one victim's food stamps card .",

        "article": "At first glance the rectangular island of Por-Bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest Siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1,300 years ago. Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead\u00a0imprisoning\u00a0them,\u00a0and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, Por-Bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern Siberia . A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined . The fortress is located\u00a0about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition . The name Por-Bajin translates as 'clay house' in the Tuvan language, and the island sits between the Sayan and Altai ranges, about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border. The location was first discovered in 1891, and the purpose of island has still not been explained over a century later. More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood. Experts say the island was built during the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840 AD) but it is not clear what their motive would be for constructing a fortress for in such a solitary place \u2013 as it is far from big settlements and trade routes. Archaeologists conducted limited and inconclusive excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1960s . The ruined structures have led experts to believe the island was used as a fortress or prison . The island has baffled experts for over a hundred years who say it could have been anything from a prison, to a palace or monastry . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition. Scientists were able to use laser mapping to create a 3D image of what the 3.5 hectare plot could have been used for. Although it is said to be around 1,300 years old, many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts, covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases. Isolated ruins! The fortress is connected to other land via a small walkway . Irina Arzhantseva of the Russian Academy of Sciences is now digging here for the Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation to find out just when the complex was built and why . Even more confusing than the debate of why it was created is the question of why it was abandoned. Researches have noted the lack of heating systems on the island, despite it enduring harsh Siberian weather and being located 7,545 feet above sea level. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and echoed the confusion. 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind,' he said. Por-Bajin ('clay House' in the Tuvan language) was long thought to be a fortress built by the Uighurs . The few artifacts unearthed at the site seem to date it to the mid-eighth century .

        "article": "No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes . Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain\u2019s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years\u2019 separation with consent; or five years\u2019 separation without consent. The second reason \u2013 unreasonable behaviour\u2019 \u2013 is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: \u2018We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.\u2019 Couples would have a one-year \u2018cooling off period\u2019 after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for \u2018no fault\u2019 divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: \u2018Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. \u2018Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce \u2014 a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.\u2019",

        "article": "A Russian woman indundated with vicious and homophobic messages for running a support group for LGBT teenagers, has publicly shamed her trolls by posting their identities online. Elena Klimova, 26, who runs Children 404 - an online support group for  young people about coming out and dealing with discrimination - regularly receives obscene hate-filled rants from strangers telling her she's 'disgusting' and should kill herself. The activist fought back by publishing the messages on\u00a0VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, under the title: 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me'. Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls, and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender (pictured) to a Russian website called VKontakte . Comments include one from a man who told her: You f****** animal, delete your f****** LGBT group.' A woman named Yulia sent Elena a particularly vitriolic message. 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online, so I have a request for you, teach him not to show his f***** tendencies when he comes to family gatherings. 'He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f**, so he can sit and shut up.' Elena posted this message along with a photo of Yulia grinning and posing with a bunch of wild flowers. While Elena has revealed the faces of the people her trolls, MailOnline has blurred them. Elena Klimova (pictured) is a Russian activist for the LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) community who receives a vast volume of hate mail . 'You f*****g animal, delete your f*****g LGBT group,' one man wrote to Elena, which she rather poignantly posted with a photo of said man holding an outstretched cat (pictured) 'As beautiful people write to me often, this album will be continually updated,' Klimova wrote on her VKontakte page, according to\u00a0Buzzfeed. 'It was created for the enjoyment of contrasts and the diversity of life.' The name of Elena's group, Children 404, is a reference to the 'page not found' online error notice and Russia\u2019s law banning 'gay propaganda' among minors. One of the website's slogans is 'LGBT Teens: We Exist.' Another message, this time from a man named Dmitry, referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts'. In Dmitry's photo, he is seen with his arm affectionately around the shoulders of a female companion. This woman (pictured) wrote, 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online.

Several people called Elena 'disgusting' and said she would 'burn in hell' for supporting the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Although homosexual relationships in Russia were decriminalised in 1993, discrimination still runs rampant.

        "article": "Fighter pilots flying the deadly F-35 Lightning II jet have very special  secret weapon - a $400,000 helmet that allows them to see through the plane. Six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft allow its pilots to 'look through' the air-frame, giving them a perfect 360 degree view of their surroundings and enemies. And all of the information they need to complete their mission - airspeed, altitude and even warnings systems - are projected straight onto the helmet's visor rather than the traditional 'heads-up display'. Scroll down for videos . High-tech: The F-35 jet's $400,000 helmet (pictured) gives the pilot a 360 degree view around their aircraft and even allows them to see through its frame . Complex: The six infrared cameras placed around the plane means that when the pilot looks down, they see the world below them in their visor . Problems: Its staggering $400,000 price tag is millions more than the original budget because of problems in its development . Destructive: The F-35 Lightning II is considered one of the most complex pieces of weaponry ever and is programmed with 8 million lines of software code, compared to an F-22 Raptor's 1.7 million . 'When the helmet's tuned correctly to the pilot's eyes, you almost step into this other world where all this information comes in,' a test pilot for the Lockhead Martin, the plane's prime contractor told the Washington Post. Al Norman added: 'You can look through the jet's eyeballs to see the world as the jet sees the world.' Like the jet - which is estimated to cost around $1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years - the helmet is incredibly expensive. Each custom-made piece of high-tech headgear costs nearly half a million dollars, which is reportedly millions over its original budget due to development problems. Earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state-of-the-art video system which caused motion sickness, the Washington Post reports. There was also a green glow in the night vision function that obscured the pilots' vision and in 2011, the Pentagon allegedly hired BAE Systems to build a backup. The F-35 Lightning II has what is considered to be 'one of the most complicated weapons systems ever'. Whereas a fighter jet like the F-22 Raptor is programmed with around 1.7 million lines of software code, the F-35 has up to a staggering 8 million. It comes in three versions, including one that is designed to take off and land on an aircraft carrier and another that lands vertically like a harrier jet. Trouble:\u00a0Earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state-of-the-art video system which caused motion sickness . State-of-the-art: The information which would usually be on the 'heads-up display' - airspeed, altitude and even warnings systems - is projected straight onto the helmet's visor . Joint attack: The helmet is so advanced that it allows pilots to share information with other F-35 jets nearby . Military force: The U.S. government estimated the F-35 would cost around $1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years . The helmet incredibly allows pilots to share information with other F-35's near it but that function has also had teething problems, the program's executive officer. Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan said: 'If one or two jets are flying together, they have been able to share information seamlessly. 'But when there are four jets, communication problems emerge, which can 'create an inaccurate picture for the pilot.' The Pentagon's astonishing estimate for the lifetime cost an F-35 is up almost $120billion from about year ago. But it still plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes that can evade radar detection and can reach well over supersonic speed. The new estimate includes maintenance costs of around $1.1trillion over the plane's lifetime, the price of the aircraft itself which is $332billion and another $63.8billion for the engine. The fighter jet's developers Lockhead Martin\u00a0say 'the supersonic, multi-role F-35 represents a quantum leap' in airborne warfare. Its 'advanced stealth' allows it to fly over areas without being detected by sophisticated radar systems that other jets cannot. Its constructors claim it can be used for a range of missions which include air-to-air combat, ground strikes, electronic attack and even reconnaissance because it is such a versatile machine. Its 'advanced electronic warfare' function allow it to locate and track enemy forces and even jam their radars. The state-of-the-art helmet - which costs $400,000 - give the pilot real-time access to battle space information with 360-degree coverage of their surroundings. The F-35\u2019s stealth capabilities and ability to carry weapons inside it's airframe mean it can engage its targets from long-range without being detected. Lockhead Martin says the F-35 'will enter the battlespace first, clearing the way' for  coalition forces. The company describes it as the 'quarterback' for a joint strike force because it can share what it sees with other jets nearby, expanding the 'situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft'.",

        "article": "Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain, but the Turkish midfielder was the one left blushing as his side lost away at rivals Dundee. Former Portsmouth ace Ciftci briefly levelled the scores at Dens Park when he slotted home a penalty after Greg Stewart had given the hosts the lead. The 23-year-old celebrated by trying to rile Dundee No 1 Bain, but his actions came back to haunt him as The Dark Blues earned all three points thanks to further goals from Jake McPake and Paul Heffernan. Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . It was Dundee's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place, as United's poor run of domestic form continued. In front of a sell-out crowd, Dundee started well with midfielder Jim McAlister trying his luck early on with a 25-yard snap-shot on his left-foot which Radoslaw Cierzniak in the visitor\u2019s goal held. United's reply was a sweeping move involving Paul Dixon and Chris Erskine who, in turn, fed Ciftci - but his low shot was saved by Scott Bain. Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . However, Dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through Stewart. The home side's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by Cierzniak, but the Polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net, leaving him red-faced. The lead, however, was short-lived as United levelled two minutes later. Chris Erksine's powerful shot came off the hand off Dark Blues skipper Kevin Thomson's hand, and referee John Beaton pointed straight to the spot. Up stepped Ciftci to send Bain the wrong way and square things up. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . However, Dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when Stewart's corner was met by McPake, who rose above Jaroslaw Fojut head past Cierzniak from six yards. As the half-hour mark approached, United came close to equalising when Aidan Connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which Bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar. The Tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute Dixon's whipped cross was met by Connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide. Dundee Utd's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . United attempted to step up a gear and John Rankin's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by Stewart for a corner. At the other end, Dundee's Paul McGowan released Paul McGinn down the right and his cross picked out Heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken. However, Heffernan was not to be denied and the Irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half. Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . Skipper Thomson sent Stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for Heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post. McGowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining, only for Cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header. However, the hard work had already been done by the hosts - who were by far the better team on the night.",

Henyekane's club, Free State Stars, said the 31-year-old player was traveling with four other people in the vehicle but was the only person to die in the crash. Henyekane made nine appearances for South Africa in 2009. He was on loan at Free State Stars from Pretoria-based Mamelodi Sundowns. Henyekane went on as a substitute in Stars' 1-0 loss to AmaZulu in the east coast city of Durban in the PSL on Saturday. Richard Henyekane died tragically in a car accident on Tuesday morning while he driving in Bethlehem . South African media reported the crash happened in Bethlehem, the town in central South Africa where Free State Stars are based. Other South African clubs, South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan, and the minister of sport sent messages of condolence for Henyekane. Henyekane's younger brother, Joseph, who was also a footballer, died in December. South Africa has a poor road safety record. Runner and former 800-meter world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi died in a road accident late last year. The forward made nine appearances for South Africa in 2009 and played for Free State Stars this season .",

        "article": "Those who achieve greatness are high achievers from an early stage. They know this better than most at Anfield. Take Michael Owen. By the time he was 20 in December 1999, his list of accomplishments read like the wish-list of many footballers. He had been named PFA Young Player of the Year (1998), scored one of the greatest World Cup finals goals and won BBC Sports Personality of the Year. There were also 18 England caps and he had passed 50 career goals for Liverpool. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new contract worth \u00a3100,000-a-week . Sterling trains with his Liverpool team-mates at Melwood as the Reds prepare to face Arsenal on Saturday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) insists that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Then there is Robbie Fowler. Another PFA Young Player of the Year award winner (1995), he had entered the record books by scoring the fastest hat-trick in the Barclays Premier League on his way to 50 goals by his 20th birthday and won his first major honour (the 1995 League Cup). Others had similar impacts. Steve McManaman ended his first season as a Liverpool regular with a Man-of-the-Match performance in the 1992 FA Cup final win over Sunderland. Steven Gerrard's first year out of his teens saw him collect the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. That is the barometer by which those on The Kop judge prodigies. So let us now look at the CV of Raheem Sterling, who was 20 on December 8 last year. It currently reads: Liverpool Young Player of the Year 2013-2014 and Europe's Golden Boy 2014. There are also 14 England caps and one goal. Steven Gerrard had won three trophies in the first year out of his teens including the FA Cup and UEFA Cup . Michael Owen scored this memorable goal against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup when he was just 18 . Owen had been named BBC Sports Personality of the Year and scored over 50 goals when he hit 20 . Steve McManaman lifts the FA Cup in 1992 after helping Liverpool defeat Sunderland at Wembley . Robbie Fowler was PFA Young Player of the Year in 1995 and scored the Premier League's fastest hat-trick . Good? Yes. Great? No. Just 18 months ago he couldn't even get a start for Liverpool. This should not come across as an attempt to belittle Sterling's talents \u2014 he is undeniably exciting \u2014 but he has become embroiled in a storm that has made him out to be on par with the four men named above. His comments in that ridiculously misguided BBC interview about wanting to challenge for trophies in his career and playing with the best players evoked memories of the Luis Suarez affair. He is absolutely not in the same sphere as the Uruguayan. 'That was probably Raheem looking over the course of the next 15 years if he plays to 35,' Brendan Rodgers observed on Thursday. 'Players now look to later in their career and their life. But I can only focus on here, Liverpool and what is best for now. As a 20-year-old, he's not at that level. 'We think that it will be best for him here and we will work hard to ensure he stays.' Sterling receives Europe's Golden Boy award ahead of a game against Arsenal in December last year . Sterling was named Liverpool's Young Player of the Year for 2013-14 but he is miles behind Luis Suarez . Sterling's first and only England goal arrived against Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier last Friday . Liverpool shouldn't have to work hard to keep Sterling. His advisors have every right to look to maximise their client's earnings but, somewhere and somehow, they have lost sight of the bigger picture and a series of dreadful judgements have been made. The first signs that all was not well came on October 3 when Sportsmail ran a back page story with the headline 'Kop fight to keep Sterling'. That the story came after Sterling had been anonymous in a 1-0 Champions League defeat in Basle didn't do him any favours. There have been a raft of similar stories, a lot of which have either coincided with games that have gone against Liverpool \u2014 such as when their fate in the Champions League was condemned in December \u2014 or ones in which he has played well, England against Lithuania being a prime example. Sterling, pictured in action against Chelsea, has only scored six Premier League goals so far this season . Sterling is expected to start for Liverpool when they take on Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday . The former QPR youngster is wanted by clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich . As he looks to steer Liverpool into the Champions League and win the FA Cup, Rodgers could do without this sideshow unfolding and so, more than anyone, could Sterling. If he wants to get to the level of Owen, Fowler or Gerrard, he needs to influence the games that matter. He has been regularly championed for his strength, pace and trickery after being given a platform on which to thrive by Rodgers. Deep down, Sterling will know what his manager has done for him. Now is the time to pay him back \u2014 and show potential, perhaps, can become something more substantial.",

        "article": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career to become the third player in the club's history to reach the landmark alongside Alfredo Di Stefano and Raul. The Portugal forward netted against Rayo Vallecano\u00a0in the 68th minute to move Madrid within four points of their great rivals Barcelona, letting out his frustration  following an unfair booking for a dive which could see the three-time Ballon d'Or winner suspended for Saturday's La Liga game with Eibar. Yet Ronaldo joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances by doing what all forwards should, sending a header downwards and beating goalkeeper Cristian Alvarez, before celebrating with Gareth Bale and his team-mates. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career to see off Rayo Vallecano and remain four points behind Barcelona . Ronaldo joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances with this header against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday night . Ronaldo turns to his trademark celebration after scoring the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career . The Portugal forward netted in the 68th minute to move Madrid within four points of their great rivals . Ronaldo celebrates with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale after opening the scoring for the Spanish club . Ronaldo is swamped by his Real Madrid team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the night . Rayo Vallecano:\u00a0Cristian, Tito, Amaya, Z\u00e9 Castro, Nacho, Fatau, Trashorras, Embarba, Kakuta, Bueno, Manucho . Subs: Cobeno, Miku, Insua, Ba, Aquino, Ruiz Jozabed, Lica . Goals: NONE . Booked:\u00a0Tito, Nacho, Cobeno, Amaya . Real Madrid:\u00a0Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Kroos, Modric, James; Cristiano, Benzema, Bale . Subs:\u00a0Navas, Coentrao, Hernandez, Nacho, Jese, Isco, Illarramendi . Goals:\u00a0Ronaldo (68), Rodriguez (73) Booked:\u00a0Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Kroos, Bale, Carvajal . Not only that, the former Manchester United great has scored 99 goals under manager Carlo Ancelotti in just 89 games, following his five against Granada three days ago. His latest puts the 30-year-old  just seven goals behind Di Stefano's record of 307 in 396 outings, and 23 shy of Raul's 323 in 741 \u2014\u00a0with plenty of time to surpass both Bernabeu legends. Up until his opening goal 22 minutes from time, however, it long looked like Ancelotti would be left as deflated as the balloons that Ronaldo took a disliking to in the first half. Ronaldo had given four orange balloons that invaded the pitch at the Campo de Futbol de Vallecas a kicking as his team failed to dominate against a team with little left to play for in mid-table. Rayo in no way had their flip flops on, and fancied giving the winners of La Decima a run for their money. They did just that, proving far more difficult than the Granada side beaten 9-1 on Sunday. Yet Real's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card  in the 52nd minute, received for diving inside the 18-yard box with the game at 0-0. He had beaten the offside trap, before cutting inside to shoot, only for defender Antonio Amaya to chop him down. Quite clearly, too. Replays were not needed to show it was a wrong decision from referee Mario Melero Lopez\u00a0to book Ronaldo for diving. From every angle, there was no question it should have been a penalty, and Ancelotti will appeal the caution in a bid to have his one-game ban rescinded. 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty,' Ancelotti said afterwards. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' The booking lit something in the stomachs of the Madrid players, as Toni Kroos, Bale and Dani Carvajal were cautioned for dissent less than three minutes later before they broke the deadlock soon after. Ronaldo gave four orange balloons a kicking in the first half on what was shaping up to be a frustrating evening for CR7 . Ronaldo was having a frustrating evening until he scored his 300th of the career for Real Madrid . 300 - goals . 288\u00a0- appearances . 206 - right footed . 52 - left footed . 41 - headers . 55 - penalties . 77\u00a0- assists . On 68 minutes,  Carvajal got his own back.\u00a0The Spain right-back escaped his marker down the  wing before crossing for Ronaldo to head home his 300th goal for Los Blancos. An easy way to reach a milestone. Ronaldo, in celebration, gestured towards the linesman who robbed him of the penalty and, from then on, the win never looked in doubt. It was James Rodriguez who put daylight between the teams just five minutes later.\u00a0The Colombia international's controlled shot found the bottom-left corner, and effectively killed the game off to ensure Madrid would not be left six points adrift of Barcelona. Ancelotti added: 'We tried to pressure them with more intensity high up the pitch but in the first half we were not convincing. In the second, we were more complete, we played well and we deserved to win.' They will have to repeat the trick  on Saturday against Eibar to remain within touching distance of Barcelona, but are set to be without the suspended Ronaldo. The man Real paid \u00a380million for in 2009 continued his protests with the officials after the full-time whistle, but it seems he will have to wait patiently to chase down Di Stefano and Raul. Madrid's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card from referee Mario Melero Lopez for this so-called dive . Ronaldo couldn't believe it as he was not awarded a penalty and was booked afterwards for diving . Ronaldo complains during the match as it was not going his way until his goal in the second half . James Rodriguez doubled Real's lead on Wednesday to ensure the win for the Spanish giants .",

        "article": "Whilst overseas backpackers visiting Sydney beaches are often told to go back to where they came from, Sutherland Council is instead exploring the idea of allowing them to camp right on the beach. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the council have voted to explore the possibility of allowing campervans to park at allocated locations with 'high tourist appeal,' in order to deter travellers from bypassing our most beautiful beaches. Among these locations are Cronulla beach and Wanda beach, both in southern Sydney, as it was found that due to a shortage of\u00a0accommodation, many tourists were neglecting these areas altogether. The Sutherland Shire Council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach . Cronulla beach is often bypassed by tourist due to the shortage of accommodation in the area . Many locals have already had a negative response to the backpacker vans crowding the beachside streets . This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost the backpackers bring to the area. On average, seasoned travellers spend $700 on eating out and shopping during a stay. Many locals have already had a mostly negative response to the backpacker vans crowding the beachside streets. Although most are well-behaved, their bad reputation stems from those who act in a\u00a0disorderly\u00a0manner during\u00a0their stay. 'We want people to come to our country, we want them to visit us, but in many cases it is as long as you don't come in my street and don't come in my area,' he said. This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost the backpackers bring . Some locals believe it cannot be done without rezoning open park areas due to rising land values in Cronulla . 'I want them to spend money and go to restaurants.' According to Mr Simpson, a short-stay camping site close to the beach would encourage seasoned travellers, retirees and various campervan users to the areas. He believes this would also solve the current issue of younger visitors parking their vans illegally on the streets. 'If you put people in areas that are well-maintained, and they can go there at a reasonable cost, it takes away that problem of being harassed in streets, and people knocking on their windows,' he said. Sutherland Mayor Kent Johns is keen to attract more tourists but keep away those who act in an unwelcome manner. This proposal aims to solve the current issue of younger visitors parking their vans illegally on the streets. Mayor Kent Johns is keen to attract more tourists but keep away those who act in an unwelcome manner . President of the Cronulla Chamber of Commerce, Mark Aprilovic, disagrees with Mr Simpson's vision. 'Where can you put them  and how can do you do this without offending the local people?' said Mr Aprilovic. Others believe that this feat cannot be done due to rising land values in Cronulla. 'There is only one hope near Cronulla and that is to rezone open park areas in front of the Green Hills Land estate,' the owner of Cronulla Beach Youth Hostel Michael Keogh said. Mr Keogh is often asked by young backpackers if they can sleep in their vans and still use his facilities and he always declines.",

Albert Webb, 51, and sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19, followed people aged up to 97 home from the Post Office after they had collected their pensions before demanding the cash. If the victim had no money on them, they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it, or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them. Albert Webb, 51, from Surrey, was jailed for three and a half years and son Jimmy Chuter, 26, was jailed for four years after they harassed pensioners with dementia in the street, demanding money . In total the family gang carried out 35 thefts, starting in February 2012 - when pensioners were still able to withdraw cash from their local Post Office. Most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s, while the eldest was a 97-year-old man. The trio would drive alongside their victims in a\u00a0silver Mercedes C200 until they got close to their house, before jumping out and telling them they had come to collect payment for roofing work. Jesse Webb, 19, was due to be sentenced with his father and brother, but went on the run. He was given a 12 month term this week after being caught . In fact, no work had been carried out, but because many of the elderly victims were suffering from dementia, they simply accepted what they were being told. The offending continued until October 2015 across Hertfordshire, Avon and Somerset, Hampshire, Oxford and Surrey. By the time officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary managed to catch up with the gang, it is believed they had taken around \u00a315,000 from their vulnerable victims. Appearing at St Albans Crown Court in January, Chuter, from  Somerset, was jailed for four years for conspiracy to defraud and Albert Webb, from Surrey, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and fraud offences. Jesse Webb was due to be sentenced on the same day, but went on the run. He was tracked down and appeared in the dock on Thursday this week, where he was given 12 months behind bars. Detective constable Kieran Doyle said: 'We were able to arrest his father and brother and bring them before the courts but Jesse evaded police so upon their sentencing, we issued a wanted appeal to trace Jesse. 'We received information which led us to him and I'm pleased that he has had his day in court. 'These really were shameful crimes and it's beyond belief that they could stoop so low to pick out their victims and follow them home, and then make them believe they had carried out repairs to their house and harass them for money.' Officers have started proceedings to confiscate their criminal gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The vehicle used during the crimes has already been confiscated by police. St Albans Crown Court heard that the trio would follow their elderly victims, often stalking them home from the Post Office, before jumping out of a car and demanding cash for repairs they hadn't done .",

A shop spokesman said: 'When he was asked where he was going he told the security guard that he wanted to buy the phone - and was going to his car to get his wallet.

'When they arrived he denied being anywhere near the shop so in a way condemned himself as we were able to prove he had been there just 30 minutes earlier.'

In protest at their 'horrible' school meals, high school students in north east China's Jilin province are being forced to the sidewalk everyday to eat their lunch. With teachers banning packed lunches and erecting barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling, the students' only option is to leave school grounds to eat everyday, the People's Daily Online reports. A group of students eat their lunch together at a local street vendor near the school premises . Left, a group of students eat their lunch while sitting on the sidewalk. Right, they make their way back to class after being forced to leave the school grounds to eat . Pictures of large groups of students sitting on the kerb eating their lunch have spread rapidly across Wechat, China's version of Whatsapp. According to students, their school banned all pre-packed lunches and cut their lunch break from one hour to 30 minutes, forcing students to eat their lunch outside on the street. Students claim food cooked in the school canteen is simply too horrible to eat, and it is so bad that at one point the canteen even closed down. The school has resorted to drastic measures to keep out students who may try to smuggle in food by putting up barbed wire and metal sheeting to block off the back entrance. The school canteen also fought back by only serving staff - but they are continuing to sell lunch boxes at 10 yuan a piece which the school recommends the students buy. And in a further effort to make eating outside of the school more difficult, street vendors are banned from operating outside of its gates. The images attracted thousands of comments on various Chinese websites. One person, from Jiangsu, said the schools were 'only after money'. Others also questioned those who were in charge of the greatly-despised canteen, including the school's headmaster, who was branded 'shameless'. The school has banned students from bringing food onto the premises and has even erected barbed wire and metal sheeting to prevent smuggling at its back entrance .",

The first-leg of the highly anticipated tie will take place at the\u00a0Parc des Princes on Wednesday.

        "article": "When Leanne Bourne, a mother-of-four from Romford in Essex, began to suspect that her partner Steve  was having an affair, she was heartbroken. But in a twist that she could never have foreseen, the other woman turned out to be her younger sister Larissa Knipe. Now, three years after the affair that tore her family apart, Ms Bourne says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happens - and still has bad days when she can't stop crying. Scroll down for video . Family feud: Larissa Knipe (left) is pictured with her son Logun and sister Leanne Bourne (right) 'I was very protective of Larissa because she was my baby sister,' she says of her happy upbringing. 'She wasn't just my sister. She was like a best friend and I'd do anything for her.' But all that changed when Larissa, who is seven years younger than Ms Bourne, moved into her home when she was 17. Although Larissa says there was nothing between her and Steve to begin with, a night out when she was 20 resulted in a liaison with her sister's partner - and the start of an affair. 'I was 20 when it first started with Steve,' she confesses. 'I went out one night, had a few too many drinks, came back, saw him and we started kissing. It started like that. 'The next morning, I woke up and thought, \"What have you done?\" I don't know why I carried it on to be honest but I did. After the first few months, I did start getting feelings and began falling for him.' Upset: Leanne Bourne appeared on ITV's This Morning to tell her story . Rapprochement: Larissa is finally winning back her sister after more than three years in the cold . Caught in the middle: Sarah Guyton was caught in the centre of the increasingly acrimonious dispute . Noticing that the pair were spending increasing amounts of time together, Ms Bourne became suspicious but, believing that her sister would do nothing to hurt her, stayed quiet. 'I mentioned it to a couple of friends, to a couple of work colleagues,' she remembers. 'One or two of my friends actually said, \"What you're thinking, it's probably feasible\". 'Everybody else, including my mum, said, \"What are you thinking? That's your sister. She loves you. She would never do that to you\".' Then, a few months later, Larissa revealed she was pregnant and claimed not to know who the father was. 'Larissa had never really had a boyfriend. If she had, I'd never met any. Then one day I came home from work and she said she was pregnant,' Ms Bourne recalls. But she was left even more suspicious by her sister and Mr Allsop's reaction. 'Larissa and Steve were both over the moon about it, really happy,' she says. 'I was quite concerned. I really felt like I was going crazy, like I was losing it. I was having a battle in my own mind.' Putting her fears to one side, she supported her sister and was there when Larissa gave birth to her son Logun in August 2011. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Ms Bourne says she was convinced that her sister was the other woman the moment she saw the newborn. Shock: Leanne also spoke of the moment that she realised her sister's baby had been fathered by her partner . 'I had suspicions anyway but as soon as I saw the baby, I knew because not only did it look like Steve, it look like my children when they were babies. It was just too much for coincidence. 'I had to run out of the room. I saw a friend straight after and I said, \"That baby is Steve's\". Larissa, who moved out into a council flat of her own shortly afterwards, continued to deny all talk of an affair. But then, consumed with guilt, she finally confessed the truth to their mother Sarah Guyton in a text message that read: 'Well what's she going to do when she finds out Logun is Steve's? I can't hide it any more.' 'I answered the phone and my mum's in a panic,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'She was actually crying, so I said, \"Calm down mum, what's happened?\" 'And she said, \"I'm sorry to tell you but what you've been worrying about is true\".' Ms Bourne was, she says, left 'utterly devastated' by the news and furious that despite repeated questioning, both Larissa and Steve had point-blank denied having an affair. Then, a few days after the bombshell hit, Steve moved out of Ms Bourne's home and in with her sister. 'It was a nightmare,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'I did send her some nasty text messages. I called her every name under the sun. I think most people in my position would have.' Larissa responded angrily and more than three years on, the sisters are still estranged and struggling to come to terms with what happened. 'It's still heartbreaking really,' adds Ms Bourne. 'To think we were really close and that's all gone. It's vanished. It's non existent now.'",

They're by R13, a label loved by A-listers like Lindsay Lohan, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna and they fit like a dream. When paired with platform ankle boots, VB's legs look like they go on forever!

Despite the shoes having an eye-watering six inch heel, the star appeared unhindered and strolled easily around the finishing line with her husband David and her three sons. Victoria is a devotee of huge heels - in her early years \u00a0of fame she was never seen without a pair on and once said of flat shoes: 'I just can\u2019t get my head around the footwear.' But recently she admitted in an interview with the Independent that she was now a convert, thanks to her busy lifestyle. She told the newspaper: 'I\u2019m busier now \u2013 so I couldn\u2019t totter around in a tight dress and a pair of heels! I think I feel a little more relaxed.' The star wore a pair of Ala\u00efa Boots, which retail at approximately \u00a31,500 . She continued: 'I suppose if I\u2019m being honest, I would have been scared, right at the beginning, to wear lots of layers and to wear a flat shoe. 'I would have been scared to do that. Now I\u2019m not.' But Victoria must find these boots extremely comfortable because she has been wearing them on a number of occasions recently. The Spice Girl wore them for a flight to London from LA last week and she also showcased them during an appearance on the Ellen show last week.

According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Before and after the study period, the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent MRI scans to measure the response of their brains to stress. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Dr Kevin Laugero, one of the researchers at the University of California, Davis, said: \u2018This is the first evidence that high sugar consumption \u2013 but not aspartame \u2013 may relieve stress in humans.\u2019 Finding: Scientists at the University of California, Davis (above) said the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks . However, while research shows sugary drinks can help to dull feelings of anxiety, experts warn that too many of them could be habit-forming \u2013 and may explain the desire to comfort eat under pressure. Dr Laugero, whose findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, warned that chronic stress could prompt people to make a habit of consuming too much sugar, which is not recommended due to its links to health problems. He said: \u2018The concern is that psychological or emotional stress could trigger the habitual overconsumption of sugar and amplify sugar\u2019s detrimental health effects, including obesity.\u2019 In the US, more than a third of adults and about a sixth of children are obese, with sugar-laden fizzy drinks and fruit juice partly to blame. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: \u2018The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. \u2018Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.\u2019",

        "article": "The romantics will pick Sean Dyche or Ronald Koeman, the statistics lovers will go for Jose Mourinho or, at a push, Arsene Wenger. But for me there is one standout contender for manager of the year and that's Louis van Gaal. Think about what he walked into and what he was expected to achieve in a short space of time. You can only be impressed. The stricken patient was fading fast, but the Dutch doctor hasn't just stuck plasters over the wounds, he's breathed life into a giant and resurrected it back to rude health. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is among those in the running for manager of the year . United's players celebrate together during the derby win against rivals Manchester City . Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young and Juan Mata celebrate during the 4-2 win against City . Manuel Pellegrini is punching above his weight at City... the club MUST think big or forever remain small . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . How stupid do some English football 'experts' look now? After the early-season defeats at MK Dons and Leicester City, they were laying into Van Gaal. They should have known better. When a manager as great as Van Gaal turns up in the Barclays Premier League, we should all be grateful to witness his genius at close quarters. So while he was busy trying to rectify the massive problems he inherited at Manchester United, there were too many who couldn't wait to hammer him for every single slip-up. And now they've all gone quiet as United cement their place in the top four. Job done \u2013 so far, at least. The critics will probably say he hasn't won anything. Listen, United were seventh last season, their defence was decimated in the summer, and this season the two big signings \u2013 Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria \u2013 have, for different reasons, failed to hit the heights they achieved previously. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail snapper Ian Hodgson . Despite all of that, Van Gaal has taken United back to where they wanted to be \u2013 into the top four. In fact, it's mid-April and United are still in the title race (unlikely, but they're just a point behind Arsenal so of course they're still in it). Sunday's derby victory was utterly convincing. And it highlighted one of the biggest strengths of Van Gaal's reign at United so far \u2013 the way he has worked with and improved individual players. All of a sudden Ashley Young looks brilliant \u2013 it wasn't just Sunday, he's been arguably United's best player this season. How many managers could have made Young look convincing in a United shirt? At the start of the season I was asking the question about Chris Smalling and Phil Jones \u2013 could they make the centre-half spots their own? I think that question is still pertinent, but those two played very well against City and are starting to look the part in the Old Trafford back four. Players once moaned about, such as Fellaini and Young, are now pivotal parts of the team under Van Gaal . Van Gaal\u2019s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like Young and Fellaini have benefited . Michael Carrick looks indispensible again, when even I was doubting if he would recover from the David Moyes debacle. And who knew Marouane Fellaini could be so influential for Manchester United? Even Van Gaal's decision to give Wayne Rooney the captaincy looks inspired. He's had a brilliant season and he's led the United resurgence on the field superbly. Impressive stuff, so all the critics need to calm down and pay a bit more respect to Van Gaal, he deserved a better reception from the English football public based on his career record alone. A little more than a year ago Manchester United were humiliated at home by City. Van Gaal has single-handedly raised the sinking ship back to the surface, steadied it, and got it sailing full steam ahead. He just needs to add a bit of polish next season.

A declaration of peace in our time is premature. Dave King, the chairman-elect, has still to obtain the SFA clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom. Details of how the club proposes to stabilise the finances have yet to come. And the Championship promotion play-offs threaten more landmines than the Somme.

Former Rangers chairman and manager Smith hopes that the club can move on from its off-field dramas .

'They have to get back to resembling Rangers Football Club. No club wins all the time and Rangers have had down periods before, even if this one is different. 'Everyone has to adjust to it. People on the outside, fans, everyone. 'There was a lack of trust before. It was simple. Now there isn't. 'They trust the people are there for Rangers \u2014 and that's a big start after three or four years of upset.' Smith exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned \u2014 against his instincts \u2014 as chairman. It is a decision he regrets and, despite the return to the club of familiar faces such as King and Paul Murray, he is 67 now and has no need to embroil himself in the grief or stress of it all a minute longer. Asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime, Smith said: 'I think they are unlikely to do that. I made my part quite clear \u2014 I don't think they will ask. There is a board there in place and they will make the decisions. 'I made mine when I left and I won't go back. 'They are not liable to ask me what course of action they will take. 'A lot of the decisions right now are financial and that's never been my department.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle United, scores agianst Dumbarton . Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scores his first goal agianst Dumbarton in the Scottish Championship . Hardie celebrates after scoring a brace during the Scottish Championship match against Dumbarton . Smith knows King from his second spell as manager. The South African businessman was a director of the oldco before administration and liquidation and, because he served on the board during the five years prior to an insolvency event, he breaches article 10 of the SFA rulebook. He may do so on two counts. As part of his settlement with the South African tax authorities, King agreed to pay \u00a343.7million but was convicted of 41 breaches of section 75 of the SA Income Tax Act. In return for paying \u00a3210,000, he was spared 82 years in jail \u2014 two years on each count. The SFA are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other, King has agreed to stay off the Rangers board. He doesn't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash, but Smith believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand. 'The courts seem to think he's OK,' said Smith on the issue. 'The SFA will give their own judgment on it. 'Dave has stepped in, so I don't see things changing in terms of how Rangers moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it. 'It would obviously be better if he could be involved at the club \u2014 that would be better for everyone. 'I don't know all the background of what constitutes a fit-and- proper person. They have obviously got to show a bit of care with Rangers after what has gone on. I think that is what they are doing at the moment. 'I don't know what the outcome will be. I don't think it will make a massive difference to Rangers one way or the other. But the preferable aspect would be that he would be involved at the club.' Dumbarton's Garry Flemming (left) comes in with a strong challenge on Rangers' Darren McGregor (right) Rangers were never likely to be a quick fix. Promotion to the Premiership remains fraught with doubt and there are large question marks over who the manager will be next season and how much cash he may have to build a new squad. 'A few bad results and you get the sack \u2014 and someone comes in and performances are lifted,' Smith observed. 'That's what happened and it's a starting point for Rangers. 'They have to build on what they are trying to do. It's just a start and people have to remember it. 'But patience and Rangers don't really go hand in hand and never have done. There is more understanding. I won't say patience. 'That goes for all aspects of the club, on and off the pitch. It takes time to clear things off the pitch, but the pressure is always on to win regardless of off-field circumstances. 'There is an understanding of what needs to be done to take a step forward. 'Stuart McCall has been bold enough to take the job and he'll stand by his results over that period. 'It is going to take time. They are not going to jump into the Premiership and challenge Celtic right away. But that is where they should be playing. And, for Scottish football, that is where they should be playing as well.'

Ashley Arenson said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. The Arkansas-native is one of four Americans confirmed to have died when an earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, causing a tsunami of snow and ice to engulf the base camp. Ashley Arenson (left) said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. He was one of the four American citizens to die at Mount Everest during the deadly avalanche on Saturday . Arenson revealed that the Google engineer and Arkansas-native wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed . After hearing the news of his death. Arenson posted an image of Fridenburg wearing a white t-shirt on Instagram alongside the message: Modern day superman. This photo was taken at The Laundry, SF during construction in September. 'Pure joy overcame @danfredinburg as he showed me one of the ways he is going to change the world.' Speaking to CNN, Arenson said: 'He's brought out the best version in me.\u00a0He would constantly make you want to be the best person you can. 'All of his choices were to help him become happy. 'He had this way of making the people around him just feel special without even trying, and make people feel like they could accomplish anything they wanted,' she added. She revealed that he wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed. The Arkansas School of Math graduate had planned to attempt to reach the summit, when his trip was cancelled. He had been travelling to the Himalayas frequently as part of the Google Adventures team, who were mapping out extreme routes around the world. 'I don't think Dan would want people to do just one thing. He would want them to constantly challenge themselves,' Arenson said. 'What Dan would want is for every single person out there to live life to the fullest and live in the moment because that's what he did. That's how he lived his life.' Arenson sat alongside one of Fredinburg's closest friends Michael North. The couple often went on adventures together and would share their experiences on Instagram. Arenson said Fredinnburg brought out the best in her . On this social media post four months ago, Arenson said she couldn't wait to be reunited with her 'partner in crime'. The pair met again before he set off to Everest for the expedition . The pair were wearing yellow scarves, which are given during a Nepalese ceremony to ensure  safe passage over the mountain. He said: 'We would say Dan had this ability to create a reality-distortion field. That he had so much power, he could change reality ... He would make the world just such a happy, vibrant place to be.' North also started a company with Fredinburg called Save the Ice, a group which travels the world to document climate change hotspots. They released a statement following his death saying: 'Save the Ice mourns the loss of our co-founder Dan Fredinburg, who perished during this morning's avalanche while climbing Mt. Everest for our \"Expedition Everest\" campaign. We have lost a great friend, inspiring adventurer, and, above all, a warrior for the planet.' His friends have since uploaded a Crowdrise\u00a0page in Fredinburg's memory, with all the funds going to relief efforts and an orphanage he was involved in. More than $38,000 has been raised so far. Fredinburg\u00a0started at Google in 2007. Beforehand he graduated from the Arkansas School of Math, Science and Art in Hot Springs in 1999, before moving on with his career. He started at the technology company as product manager and then head of privacy at Google X, the company's secretive arm best known for 'moonshot' projects such as the self-driving car.

Arenson posted an image of Fredinburg wearing a white t-shirt on Instagram alongside a message which began: 'Modern day superman' Before Dan\u00a0Fredinburg left for his Everest expedition, his girlfriend gave him a bundle of letters he could only open when he reached the summit. It is not known whether he got a chance to read them. Close friend Max Stossel posted a picture of the message he wrote to his late friend on Facebook on Saturday alongside a tribute. Part of it read:\u00a0'Your story has already greatly impacted mine for the better. With each adventure you return with stories that most people wouldn't dream of experiencing themselves. 'Thank you for pushing the human race to be greater, more daring, and to truly live life rather than survive it.'

Hearing problems had run strongly through the genetics of\u00a0Ahavah and Jason Cook, with both their mothers and fathers deaf. But after the baby boy was confirmed to be profoundly deaf in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, the couple from Andova, Minnesota, were afforded something neither of their parents were. Last month, they were able to experience the moment their son was able to hear for the first time, thanks to a pair of specially-fitted hearing aids. Amazing moment: Elijah Cook was last month fitted with hearing aids that allowed him to properly hear the voice of his mother, Ahavah Cook, for the first time . All smiles: Tests confirmed he was profoundly death in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, but doctors decided to fit him with hearing aids as soon as possible . What's that noise?: Elijah will now undergone a more serious set of tests in a few months, at about seven-months-old, to determine what more can be done about his hearing . Elijah failed his first hearing test just 12 hours after being born in Coon Rapids on January 2. 'When Elijah came back (from the first test), we were expecting good news because we have almost a dozen nieces and nephews that have no hearing issues,' Mrs Cook wrote on the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota\u00a0website. Elijah went on to fail three more tests. Then on March 5, at nine-weeks-old, he was fitting with the hearing aids, and the amazing moment was caught on video. 'The first time I saw him blink, I had a lot of emotions,' Mrs Cook said. 'I was trying really hard not to cry. 'I didn't want him to see me cry. I was trying hard to keep it together and just talk to him.' Family: Ahavah and Jason Cook are pictured here with little Elijah and their eldest, daughter Evelyn, 7 . Progress: The mothers and fathers of both Ahavah and Jason Cook were all deaf, so the couple were expecting hearing problems following the birth of their son, Elijah (right) Since then, Elijah has been cooing, smiling and responding to the sounds made by his family, including big sister Evelyn, 7. 'The cooing is the big thing,' Mr Cook said. 'He wasn't very talkative, but ever since he was fitted for his hearing aids he's cooing more, he pays more attention.' Because he is so young, doctors will wait a until Elijah is about seven months old to make further deductions about his hearing. Until then, his parents are happy with the progress and say their experience growing up in deaf families has well-equipped them for the road ahead. The touching family moment was first uploaded to YouTube. Fighter:\u00a0Elijah Cook was born profoundly deaf in his left ear and able to hear only 75 decibels in his right .",

Michelle Newman said all she heard was a 'pop' and looked up to see her son James' heels as he fell from the second floor of their condo in Las Vegas. The child had fallen out of the window, which had been propped open to let in the breeze, and died from his injuries. James Krainch was almost two-years-old when he toppled out of a second floor condo window and died .

'When I got to his side, he gave me one last smile and then went unconscious,' Mrs Newman told the Deseret News. On the ninth anniversary of his death Ms Newman visited her son's grave with her two other children Spencer and Kierah Krainich to celebrate the life of their brother. 'A lot of times we'll fly kites and we'll play games,' she said. 'We'll do things I think James would have liked doing with us.' James was 22 months and tumbled from the window because a screen was not strong enough to hold him . Ms Newman said James, who was 22 months old when he died, had fallen from the window as he was sat on the sofa, while she fed his younger brother who was then around six months old. The screen was not strong enough to prevent him from tumbling to the ground. Michelle Newman said she hopes by sharing her story other parents will safety proof their homes . She added: 'I just heard a pop and I looked over my shoulder and I just saw his heels as he toppled out the window,' After he hit the ground James lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital.

Ms Newman said she hopes her story will make people think twice about how they can make their homes safer for their children by not putting furniture close to windows. To try and cope with the agony of losing her son Ms Newman started a blog about him and her experience four years after his death. She previously told hold she still included James in the Christmas draw of names, with whoever received his name buying gifts he would have liked at that age and giving them to a child who needs them.",

But Belfast's IBF super-bantamweight world champion has called on the Matchroom chief to make him a more realistic offer. Super-bantamweight world champion Carl Frampton (left) has dismissed a fight offer from Scott Quigg . Quigg (right) offered \u00a31.5m to Frampton for a British super-fight, via his promoter Eddie Hearn . 'It\u2019s the biggest publicity stunt I\u2019ve seen since that incident between Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at Superbowl XXXVIII (when Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Timberlake),' Frampton wrote in his News Letter column. '[It] is undoubtedly a lot of money. But does that mean I should snap it up with both hands? 'Absolutely not, and there are a number of reasons why. 'It\u2019s a flat rate offer, which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office, this is the most I\u2019ll receive.

Quigg showed off a \u00a31.5m cheque ready to hand to Frampton on Sky Sports earlier this week . But Frampton has branded the gesture a 'publicity stunt' and ridiculed the offer . Hearn was quick to respond on Twitter, saying: '[The] fact is we are putting offers on the table and you aren't! If the offer is that bad then make us one? 'Also, if it makes as much money as you stated in your link, why have you also turned down 60-40 for the winner?'

Ranulfo Perez, 48, was arrested by police  after he allegedly groped the breasts of a 16-year-old girl who was outside a Toys R Us store as she was shown round with her tour group. However he was later released by the Manhattan District Attorney over concerns that the teenager lost sight of her attacker and could not be sure it was Perez. The incident is the latest involving people dressed up as costumed characters in Times Square, amid claims of sexual harassment and disorder. Scroll down for video . A man who dresses as the Cookie Monster and greets visitors to Times Square was arrested for allegedly groping a 16-year-old and then freed after police could not be sure it was him. Officials said the number of costumed characters in the area, like those pictured, are becoming an increasing problem in New York . The girl had claimed she was grabbed in a hug by a man dressed as the Cookie Monster who then touched her breasts. Perez was arrested at the scene, and charged with forcible touching in a manner injurious to a child less than 17, as well as second degree harassment, gothamist reported. The incident took place at about 5.30pm on Sunday. He was released on Tuesday morning as police confirmed they would not be prosecuting the case. The teenage girl, who was visiting from Winsconsin, told the New York Post: 'I am beyond upset about it. My level of anger right now isn't just about being molested. The fact that the Manhattan DA is 100 percent OK with it is utterly disgusting.' Perez told the newspaper that officers, who arrested him on Monday, had got the wrong Cookie Monster. He said: 'I love people and I love children . . . It could have been anyone else, but not me.' In recent years there has been a rise in the number of people dressing up in costumes as characters from popular television shows in Times Square, leading to calls for them to be regulated and forced to apply for a licence costing $175. In 2012 a man dressed as Elmo was arrested in Times Square following a loud verbal exchange . Rosa Sanchez, 36, pictured here dressed as Elmo, was arrested for aggressive panhandling . Costumed characters are a regular appearance in Times Square, with a number demanding tips . The characters are becoming renowned for causing disturbances in their interaction with members of the public and a crackdown on the issue has been dubbed Operation Sesame Street. Police have recently been distributing flyers reminding people that they do not have to pay to pose with the characters, following a number of incidents. Almost 20 costumed characters were arrested last year for a catalogue of offences. A man who dresses as Elmo from Sesame Street has been arrested several times for disorderly conduct for making anti-semitic remarks to passersby. Last year\u00a0Rosa Sanchez, 36, from New Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed as Elmo. More people are dressing up as the Cookie Monster (left), Woody from Toy Story (centre) and Elmo (right) Also in 2014 a man dressed as Toy Story hero Woody was arrested after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman by grabbing her buttocks. Several other costumed panhandlers were also arrested - in July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist. Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested that same weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic. In 2013 a different man dressed as the Cookie Monster was held by police over claims he had shoved a toddler.",

So mourners at a Taiwanese man's memorial were shocked after they were treated to a sexy performance by two scantily-clad strippers - hired by the deceased's own wife,\u00a0The People's Daily Online\u00a0reported. Dressed in little more than  underwear and thigh-high boots, the exotic dancers\u00a0showed off their moves in a scene more fitting to a strip club than a funeral home. Scroll down for video . Two hot dancers wearing just bras and miniskirts danced around the casket showing off their sexy moves to open mouthed mourners . Bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase Drop Dead Gorgeous the women gyrated around the coffin to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger in front of the open-mouthed mourners. At one stage they even draped themselves over the casket as part of their routine. Incredibly it was the deceased's wife who booked the dancers as a final gift to her husband. Mrs Jian said she knew her spouse always had an eye for the ladies and wanted to ensure that his final journey was one that he would appreciate. The exotic dancers had been hired by\u00a0Mrs Jian, from Taiwan, who said she booked them to perform at her husband\u2019s funeral as her last gift to him . Taichung Funeral Home in Taipei, Taiwan was turned into a makeshift gentleman's club when the dance music began pumping and neon lights started flashing as the girls went through their moves\u00a0on the morning of April 12. Some mourners appeared to be more interested in filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend as they vied\u00a0for the best position to take photos and videos on their smart phones. Family and friends of the deceased expressed their shock during the performance but it didn't stop the dancers who went through three different fast paced songs. They then disappeared before the drums played and the coffin was taken to the awaiting car and the start of the solemn funeral ceremony. Friends said the extremely understanding Mrs Jian was a devoted wife and after Mr Jian had suffered a stroke before his death, she would spend every minute at his bedside, attending to his every need. Draped across the coffin, the women are happy to pose for pictures in between dancing to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger . Mourners appeared to be more concerned about filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend Mr Jian . The Taiwanese phenomenon of having exotic dancers or strippers perform at funerals began in the 1980s and is thought to be connected to the local mafia who were said to have seized control of the mortuary industry and offered strippers from their clubs at a cut price. For a modest fee the scantily-clad women arrive on the neon-lit back of a diesel truck, dubbed an Electric Flower Car, to gyrate erotically in front of the departed and his mourners. The cars also offer an easy getaway if police arrive to the scene. Some have labelled the practice as scandalous, but others claim it as an important part of the grieving process - and the perfect way of sending off their loved ones with a smile. In Taiwanese culture, the more people who attend the funeral then the more honour was given to the deceased. So the strippers were used to 'bribe' more mourners into turning up. Other theories suggest the entertainment was because the ghosts of the deceased enjoyed watching strippers while they were alive. The funerals also provide one of the few forms of live\u00a0entertainment for many of the rural poor communities in Taiwan.",

This incredible image was captured above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer Graeme Whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the\u00a0Lyrid meteor shower. The annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe, but is most visible in the northern hemisphere, and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour. Scroll down for video . Close up: A magnified version of the image above shows one meteor appearing to graze the horizon, while another meteor trail appears top left . Stunning:\u00a0Graeme Whipps captured this image of the Lyrid meteor shower in the skies above\u00a0Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday . The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour, but in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour. The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher, which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun, and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as Vega and the constellation Lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name. Mr Whipps, a 50-year-old meteorologist, said: 'I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor, which was amazing.' While the Lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour, most years the peak, which occurs tonight, only produces between five and 20 per hour (the Lyrid shower pictured from space)",

        "article": "Preconceptions, I find, can be really unhelpful, so before travelling to The Datai, a luxury hotel in Malaysia, I decided not to find out anything about it. I preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival. I was travelling with my old mucker Doon Mackichan (from Smack The Pony, Plebs, The Day Today). Our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit, but since then we have, by chance, both acquired part-time homes in the same seaside town. It is Doon who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing Channel. Luxury personified: The Datai Hotel has all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City, says\u00a0Maria McErlane . Setting off for the Far East, there was something of the Hinge and Bracket about us, blithering away in actressy tones, trying to charm the Air Malaysia crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade. (Which failed.) But that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving Britain behind in cold mid-December was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of Langkawi. After a 30-minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests, The Datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City. Full-size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance, as beautiful silk sari-clad Malaysian staff welcomed us with cocktails. In the background, the ubiquitous lobby pianist/singer warbled away to I Just Called To Say I Love You. A minor note of tedium. Langkawi is an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea, 20 miles off the coast of Malaysia. In 2007 it was given World Geopark status by Unesco. The Datai Hotel and Resort is in the north west of the island. Maria McErlane (left) with painter Doon Mackichan at The Datai hotel in Malaysia . This paradise in the middle of a ten million-year-old rainforest was created in 1990. Designed by Australian architect Kerry Hill around Datai Bay - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world, with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete. To minimise its impact on the jungle, Hill limited the size of the main building and added 40 villas over the extensive grounds, along with restaurants and a spa alongside a creek. He sourced wood, marble and stone from across the island and mainland Malaysia to create Mayan walls, Malay roofs and Japanese screens. The result sees soft, subtle colours creating an atmosphere throughout of calm tranquillity, offset by genuine animal sounds that could well come from a Now That's What I Call Jungle Noises Volume 1. Leaving the main building behind, we were taken by golf buggy down the 'yellow brick roads' through the enchanted forest, across bridges, and past waterfalls and freshwater streams to our elegant beach villa where we were met by our butlers. Keen to revive our weary bones, Doon asked if it was safe to swim.\u00a0'No,' came the answer. 'Why not?' she questioned, expecting to be told of danger. 'Because it is dark,' the butler replied with a smile. Spot of swimming anyone? The Andaman Ocean turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time . Clearly he doesn't know Doon. She has been part of a team swimming the Channel in extreme conditions and also took part in the World Ice Swimming Championships in Finland ('you can feel your body slowing down as hypothermia begins to set in', she boasts). She is made of stern stuff. Despite it being close to midnight, we ran down to the beach, disrobing and squealing, before plunging into the silky-smooth Andaman sea. Phosphorescence streamed through the water, illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of Thailand on the horizon. It was a magical beginning to our holiday. Back at our opulent Balinese-meets-New England villa, we were quite overcome by the super-sized beds, hot outdoor showers, plunge pool, Bose sound system, zillionthread soft cotton sheets, quietly whirring wooden fans, high-tech lighting (we longed for a light switch) and blackout blinds. Buggies can be summoned at a moment's notice, but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach, through the jungle, along wooden walkways and up the 139 Mayan temple-inspired steps to breakfast. Clutching our nature books, we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from Tarzan vines through the trees. First class display: The pair were serenaded by doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees . Brahminy kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead, and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth. It really was a first-class display from the jungle inhabitants. After breakfast on the terrace, we took mountain bikes and cycled to the resort's golf course. Golf is not really my thing, but if you know your sand wedge from your nine iron, this course is fantastic - everything is groomed to within an inch of a Stepford wife. In fact, the Els Club Teluk Datai has been voted the best 'new' golf course in the world. Having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed, Doon arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation: a monkey burglary. Every drawer had been wrenched open, newspapers shredded, jars unscrewed, suitcase contents scattered and chocolates eaten - tiny slivers of silver paper being the only remains of a Toblerone. Doon had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had 'relieved' themselves on. We didn't need a forensics team to identify our uninvited guests as chocolatey paw prints were everywhere. I was secretly rather thrilled with their ingenuity. After such excitement, a sea dip was needed before several Beach Club cocktails and much embellished recounting of 'Monkeygate'. The four restaurants at The Datai are overseen by executive chef Richard Millar. There's the Beach Club specialising in Mediterranean and international cuisine; The Gulai House, tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome Malay and Indian offerings; the Dining Room in the main building; and The Pavilion, a restaurant on 100ft-high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants (yes, really). Doon remarked that it resembled a 'birds' nest in the sky', albeit one that serves traditional Thai cuisine. Such was our commitment to sampling all the restaurants, we both managed to gain half a stone in a week. Maria heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast . The most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats, save for the Naga Pelangi (Rainbow Dragon), a traditional wooden Malaysian junk schooner hand-built in the boatyards of Duyung island on the east coast of Malaysia. We were invited aboard for a trip to the Geopark to watch brown eagles feed and, in Doon's case, to find dolphins. Her chosen method to summon these creatures was to serenade them in full operatic mode with songs from Carmen - an impressive but futile exercise as they stayed away. If the many activities at The Datai become too much, gentler pursuits are on offer, such as an 8am nature walk that teaches participants the ways of the forest. For me, however, it was a bit early for concentration, so I excused myself and enjoyed a lazy breakfast. Later, in the bathroom, a bean bagsized frog fell from the air-con vent on to my head before hopping on to the cistern, blinking into the daylight: a reminder, were one needed, of the Herculean task it must be preventing the jungle from taking back its land. During our stay, in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake, we swam morning, noon and night. One longer excursion across the tranquil Datai Bay with flippers and snorkels resulted in us being spiked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish. Neither incident was a huge deal, but the Datai nurses were on hand within moments of us returning to land, and even took time to check on us the following day. Before leaving Datai, we squeezed in a trip to the spa, which is open to the jungle. I could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping. The ubiquitous plinky-plonky spa musak was quickly redundant when the heavens open and the full rainforest orchestra began its symphony in earnest. During my 90-minute treatment - a Ramuan massage - I'm not sure I have ever been, nor will ever be again, in such a state of zen relaxation. The Datai was truly special. Mystical, spiritual, romantic, luxurious, life-affirming... and fattening. We can't wait to go back.

        "article": "Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted. Leonardo Jardim says Monaco's performance in the Champions League shows you don't need to buy big . Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. The days of the French club signing big names like James Rodriguez (left) and Radamel Falcao are over . 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. Arturo Vidal (left) scored the only goal from the penalty spot to put Juventus in the ascendency . Luca Marrone (from left), Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli take part in a training session . 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.' Monaco will be without striker Lacina Traore and midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, who are both nursing leg injuries.

        "article": "Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on \u00a330billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra \u00a326billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The\u00a0Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly \u00a33 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was \u00a387.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from \u00a398.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of \u00a390.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than \u00a360 billion from \u00a3153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of \u00a31.48 trillion is more than \u00a3500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of \u00a3956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the \u00a35 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the \u00a310 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around \u00a330 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at \u00a326billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed \u00a3200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left \u00a3350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a \u00a3140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add \u00a36billion to Britain's interest bill, worth \u00a3350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

        "article": "Playing video games makes you better at learning than non-gamers, a study has claimed. Research found that gaming boosts the ability to learn a number of tasks more accurately, and possibly puts gamers in an 'expert category' of problem solving. But the researchers note they are not quite sure if gaming makes people learn skills better - or if people who learn skills better are more likely to become gamers. Playing video games (stock image shown) may not only improve the ability to perform visual tasks, but also the learning ability for those skills, a study by Brown University in Rhode Island has claimed . The research was carried out by scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island. To conduct the study, the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely, if ever. They participated in a two-day trial of visual task learning. Subjects were shown an on-screen \u2018texture\u2019 of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out - in a fraction of a second - the one area where an anomalous texture appeared. Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s. A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification. It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services. The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'. In visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a \u2018texture discrimination task.\u2019 Prior studies have shown that people can be trained to improve their performance in the task, but if they move on to a second task too quickly, it can interfere with the learning process. The researchers wanted to find out if gamers could overcome this interference better, compared to non-gamers. And the results showed that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks, while non-gamers did what was expected. That is, they improved on the second task they trained on, but not on the first. Learning the second task interfered with learning the first. The data show that gamers on average improved their combination of speed and accuracy by about 15 per cent on their second task and about 11 per cent on their first task. Non-gamers produced the same average 15 per cent improvement on their second task, but they actually got a bit worse on the first task they learned, by about 5 per cent. Research subjects were shown an on-screen texture of short lines - either vertical or horizontal, first one then the other - and were asked to spot anomalies. Their responses were measured in milliseconds. Gamers were shown to be more successful when learning both tasks than non-gamers . Despite the small number of participants, the results proved statistically significant. \u2018When we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing. They are quicker and more accurate,' said senior author Dr Yuka Sasaki, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University. \u2018But they may be in an expert category of visual processing. \u2018We sometimes see that an expert athlete can learn movements very quickly and accurately and a musician can play the piano at the very first sight of the notes very elegantly, so maybe the learning process is also different. \u2018Maybe they can learn more efficiently and quickly as a result of training.\u2019 The exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known, Dr Sasaki said, but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers. \u2018It may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain, especially for visually developed skills,\u2019 the researchers wrote. After training on both backgrounds, testing showed that video gamers had done better at learning the first and second. Non-gamers actually did worse on the first. But it was unresolved whether video games improve visual learning or whether good visual learners tend to play more video games . Being certain will require more research. Importantly, the study doesn't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding. The study also has a stark gender imbalance between the nearly all-male gamer group and the nearly all-female non-gamer group. But the researchers could not find evidence in the literature for gender differences in perceptual learning that would make this disparity worrisome. By documenting these and other apparent cognitive differences between gamers and non-gamers, the field is discovering that there is more to video games than merely passing the time, lead author and graduate student Aaron Berard said. \u2018A lot of people still view video games as a time-wasting activity even though research is beginning to show their beneficial aspects,\u2019 Mr Berard said. \u2018If we can demonstrate that video games may actually improve some cognitive functioning, perhaps we, as a society, can embrace newer technology and media with positive application.\u2019",

        "article": "Hundreds of children were admitted to hospital last year after being born brain damaged following exposure to alcohol in the womb, alarming new figures have revealed. In total, 272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to data from the official Health and Social Care Information Centre. But the actual number affected by their mother' s drinking could be far greater, experts have warned. Scroll down for video . Warning: New figures show that\u00a0272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to the official Health and Social Care Information Centre . Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning, behavioural and physical problems such as deformed limbs because of exposure to alcohol, according to the Sunday People. That equates to about 7,500 every year. Elizabeth Mitchell, of the National Organisation for Foetal Alchol Syndrome, told reporter Nicola Fifield: 'Children born with the syndrome don't get better. They are brain damaged. 'It is an enormous problem and one that is terribly sad and vastly under-diagnosed.' TIp of the iceberg: Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning and behavioural problems because of exposure to alcohol in the womb . One teenager who was born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is 15-year-old Niamh Brown. She needs help getting dressed, has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently. Niamh was three when her adoptive parents Julia and Simon first noticed something was wrong. She stuggled at playschool, having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention. Two years later, at the age of five,\u00a0Niamh was diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome from her birth mother's drinking. In 2007, Julia and Simon set up the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust to help others. Visit www.fasdtrust.co.uk .

        "article": "Boris Johnson today fire an extraordinary attack on the Labour party, claiming Ed Miliband wants to go back to the 'nasty, racist' era of the 1970s. The London Mayor, who today launched the Tory campaign in the capital, said the Labour leader was 'hostile' to people who wanted to own their own home and would embark on an 'orgy of regulation and state socialism'. He also claimed Ukip wanted to turn the clock back to the 1950s while the Greens want a return to 'somewhere around the bronze age'. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson today launched the Tory campaign in London with a speech in Hartley Hall, Mill Hill . Mr Johnson told voters that if they vote Conservative they will get broadband but if they vote Ukip they will get Miliband . Mr Johnson was mobbed by fans at the launch in\u00a0Mill Hill, North London where he posed for selfies with supporters. He was joined at the event by Hendon candidate Matthew Offord and his dog Max, and International Development Secretary Justine Greening. As the mayor arrived he could be heard asking whether he needed to show his ID to get in. Launching his attack on Labour, Mr Johnson told voters that if they vote Conservative they will get broadband but if they vote Ukip they will get Miliband. He also joked the Tories were the party of 'kitchen ownership' while Labour was the party of 'kitchen concealment'. Mr Johnson also said he believed the polls were starting to and would continue to move in favour of the Conservatives. He described the party's formula as 'wealth creation for a moral purpose'. In his speech, Mr Johnson repeatedly mocked Mr Miliband over the revelation he has two kitchens in his \u00a32million North London home. He said: 'I don't mind if he is so lazy he would rather not go downstairs to make a cup of tea shortly before binge-watching Breaking Bad or whatever he does. 'I mind very much that he is instinctively and intuitively hostile to the liberating policy of home ownership. We are the party of home ownership, of kitchen ownership. They are the party of hypocrisy and kitchen concealment.' Mr Johnson cuddled up to a dog wearing a blue rosette supporting local Tory candidate Matthew Offord . Mr Johnson was mobbed by fans wanting pictures and selfies when he visited a cafe Mill Hill, North London . A large media scrum followed Mr Johnson as he went on his walkabout around north west London . He also visited a shop, with Tory party leaflets in hand, to drum up support for the Conservatives . Mr Johnson is expected to campaign across the country as a senior Conservative who appeals to voters which other ministers cannot reach . Progress through the streets of Hendon was slow as he stopped for selfies with supporters . He hailed the Conservatives' record on connectivity, saying: 'If you vote Tory you get broadband, if you vote Ukip you get Miliband.' The 'main problem' with the Labour leader is not his inability to eat a bacon sandwich, the mayor went on, or that he sounds like a 'polytechnic sociology lecturer'. Nor is it that he and Ed Balls drove the car 'so spectacularly off the cliff' the last time they had the keys, he added, calling them the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics'. He said: 'The main problem is not even that they would be the playthings of the SNP and that Ed Miliband would be peeking out of Alex Salmond's sporran like a baby kangaroo. 'The main problem is that Ed Miliband and the Labour Party are now more left-wing than they have ever been at any time since Michael Foot. 'They literally want to take us back to the 1970s with an orgy of regulation and state socialism.' Mr Johnson said he believed the polls were starting to and would continue to move in favour of the Conservatives . It echoed comments made in a speech last night, in which Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband does not see that wealth creation has a moral purpose. 'And by attacking wealth creation both in rhetoric and his actions, he would take this country backwards to those 1970s that I spoke of with an orgy of higher taxation and regulation. I remember the 1970s. I wouldn't want to go back. 'It was a nasty, grim, petty epoch of really foul racism, frankly, and a union-dominated economy,' he told an\u00a0event organised by the Legatum Institute think tank. Mr Johnson also joked that Ukip wanted to take the country back to the 1950s, the Greens to 'somewhere around the bronze age' and the Liberal Democrats to whatever would give them a boost in the polls. He added: 'We are the only party presenting ourselves for election that thinks, broadly speaking, that today is better than yesterday. 'And tomorrow, broadly speaking, is going to be better than today. We have a fantastic story to tell.'",

The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn, seven, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France, while skiing with his mother Ceri and siblings Gerwyn and Antonia, after becoming separated from them. According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy\u2019s death earlier this month was \u2018a tragic accident\u2019 with no one to blame. The family, from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, were enjoying their last run of the holiday when Antonia fell and her mother stopped to help. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: \u2018The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. \u2018Had he been with someone bigger or older, the accident wouldn\u2019t have happened but it remains a dramatic and tragic accident.\u2019 In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. ' Carwyn, seven, \u00a0from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France .",

        "article": "Diego Simeone is made for England. Though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with David Beckham\u2019s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of Anglo-Saxon values, he is, in reality, more English than the English. For that night in St Etienne - almost the last time an England team truly thrilled a global audience at the World Cup, even if they did so in defeat \u2013 is remembered by Simeone for more than his notorious role in Beckham\u2019s sending off, which left England down to ten men for most of the match. 'That game was the best international match I've played in,' said Simeone, remembering the World Cup knock out match, which Argentina won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment. Diego Simeone is hoping to lead Atletico Madrid to second successive Champions League final . England's David Beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder Simeone during the 1998 World Cup . 'I love playing against the English,\u2019 Simeone added. \u2018They're so passionate, so aggressive, so committed. They were incredible that night. Alan Shearer and Paul Ince were extraordinary. At times it seemed Shearer was fighting us on his own. You have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men.\u2019 And as Simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the Champions League final last year, in full confrontational mode, seeking out Raphael Varane, who had kicked the ball at the Atletico bench in celebration of Real Madrid\u2019s 4-1 win, it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head. There is much more to Simeone than that of course. He had come within two minutes of winning that Champions League final on a wage bill which was famously less than QPR\u2019s. Since that defeat, he has exacted his revenge at every turn. Real Madrid were beaten in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs, then knocked out of the Copa del Rey, also over two legs, by Atletico, beaten at the Bernebeu and then, most spectacularly , beaten 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last February. Beckham looks towards the referee during the World Cup clash between England and Argentina . The former England man was shown a red card for lashing out at Simeone during the knock-out match . Last week the teams drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final; on Wednesday they resume hostilities at the Bernebeu. Real may be marginal favourites but under Simeone, Atletico have gone from the side that could never beat Real Madrid \u2013 they hadn\u2019t won for 14 years against them \u2013 to the side that (almost) never loses to them. What is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in Europe. Of course, he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma. In his native Argentina they always assumed he would be a manager, such was his dominance of the national team as a captain. But his early results were very mixed. He looked innovative and the man to watch at Estudiantes, where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players. It worked: they chased down Boca Juniors for the league title even if he was, in those days, criticised for being overly focused on attacking players. At River Plate though, it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far. He finished bottom of the league and had to resign. The Atleti boss confronts Raphael Varane during Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League final win last year . Simeone speaks to referee Bjorn Kuipers during the showpiece final at the Estadio da Luz . He revived his reputation somewhat at Catania and Racing but when he was given the Atletico job in 2011, it seemed more like the old boys\u2019 network at work \u2013 he was an iconic player there in the 1990s \u2013 than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in Europe . Of course, the success has been unrelenting, with a trophy every year: the Europa League in 2012; the Copa Del Rey in 2013, beating Jose Mourinho\u2019s Real in the final; and the extraordinary feat of wining La Liga ahead of Barca and Real last season. This year he is comfortably-placed for another Champions League spot but the title is out of the question. Carlo Ancelotti though is right to be nervous ahead of Wednesday\u2019s quarter final. If there were a team for the big occasion, it is Simeone\u2019s Atletico. The 44-year-old got the better of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during his side's 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . He makes a habit of out-witting Europe\u2019s best minds. It isn\u2019t just Ancelotti who has been his victim. Mourinho, too, back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season, when Atletico stunned Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having brought the game back to 1-1 and being ahead on away goals, you might have expected Simeon\u2019s side to sit back. But they came out for the second half pressing even harder, pushing forwards whenever they could. In effect, Simone did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3-1 win. And yet there is something very English about Simeone\u2019s style. It\u2019s not just the frequent use of 4-4-2, the wide men, the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it\u2019s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped: \u2018Made in England.\u2019 It\u2019s why Simeone so related to Shearer and Ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2-2 draw in St Etienne. Ince, Shearer, Simeone; they\u2019re all cast from the same mould. The Argentine manager is understandably adored by the Atletico faithful despite his team's combative style . The Atletico players circle around Simeone as they prepare for the Champions League clash against Madrid . He\u2019s not about to move, having just signed a new contract with Atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the Premier League. The problem for Simone is that his English values are no longer fashionable in England. When Manchester City choose a new manager, it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club, from academy to the first team, under the direction of Txiki Begiristain. When Arsenal appoint, pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach. Manchester United, now establishment, might baulk at a street fighter as manager, though they had one once before and he didn\u2019t do so badly. He would be adored at Liverpool, but it would be another gear change from the Brendan Rodgers style that the club has embraced. Chelsea, too, though falling back on Mourinho, also have had the Barcelona model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with Simeone. Maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years. But Simeone is useful antidote to those who think English football\u2019s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game. Perhaps he\u2019s just become too English for the new England . Atletico and Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final . Simeone is tossed \u00a0in the air by his players as they celebrate their Spanish league title last season .",

        "article": "An Afghan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with British troops was shot with his two-year-old son by Taliban hitmen after he says he was \u2018abandoned\u2019 by the UK Government. The 26-year-old, who was known as \u2018Chris\u2019 by UK soldiers, was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. His son Muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack, which Chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him because of his time spent helping the British Government \u2013 which now won\u2019t let him come to the UK. Shot: 'Chris' the interpreter (left) and his son Muhammad (right) was badly injured by Taliban gunmen near their home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. He said it is one of several attempts made to kill or kidnap him . During more than three years with UK forces, Chris worked with elite units including the SAS, Royal Marines and Parachute Regiment. The father-of-two, who spent two months in hospital after the shooting, said he has taken evidence of threats to UK authorities on ten occasions \u2013 but has repeatedly been dismissed and told merely to take more security precautions. He claims he has also narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt, and now has to hide in a network of hostels. He said: \u2018I worked outside military bases with UK forces where I took huge personal risk on a daily basis \u2013 I served with distinction, placing myself in mortal danger to save my British colleagues. \u2018My family and I have experienced a serious threat to life as a consequence of working for the British, resulting \u2013 most recently \u2013 in me being shot on December 26 when the Taliban came to my village looking for me. \u2018My son was hit too. This only happened because of my work with the British. The Government has totally forgotten its allies who helped them during the worst of times here. I have seen British soldiers die in front me and I have collected soldiers\u2019 remains \u2013 now I think I am being abandoned.\u2019 Chris \u2013 who worked for British forces between October 2008 and April 2011 \u2013 claims that UK commanders are aware that he was forced to stop working for the soldiers because of threats to his family made by the Taliban. Blood: The aftermath of another attack on an interpreter. Chris says they are at risk but that his concerns have been dismissed by the British Government . Danger: Despite attacks such as this, the majority of frontline interpreters who want to build new lives in the UK do not qualify for the immigration scheme . But like the majority of frontline translators who want to build new lives in the UK, Chris does not qualify for an immigration scheme because of his dates of service. The scheme is only available to those with at least a year\u2019s continuous service after December 2011. So far just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by the Taliban because of their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa. Last night, as it emerged that a Taliban thug suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds, Rafi \u2013 who is leading the fight to help other interpreters stay in the UK \u2013 said: \u2018Human rights? Do only criminals and those who have killed British soldiers and translators have human rights? Doors are opened to them but closed to us. Shattered: The interpreter's car was badly damaged in the attack. Just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by Taliban because of their work has been given a UK visa . Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted . \u2018It is disgusting the way we are being treated. We are not even being treated like human beings, my colleagues have to live in the shadows with their families looking over their shoulders constantly in fear of death whereas the Taliban are being allowed to stay with all the benefits from the British taxpayer. It is like we are the terrorists and they are the heroes.\u2019 Rafi, who fears giving his full name, was blown up by the Taliban in a blast that killed a British officer. He is now involved in a court case next month challenging the UK\u2019s position on translators. A judicial review brought by Rafi and one other Afghan interpreter is to challenge whether the Government complied with its statutory obligations towards hundreds of translators \u2013 and the attack on Chris and his son earlier this year will be highlighted. Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted. At least 20 interpreters serving with British troops were killed in action and dozens wounded while serving with UK forces. Six were murdered by the Taliban while on leave and five are said to have been hunted down since UK forces left. They claim the threat of violent reprisals from the Taliban has grown since British forces withdrew from Afghanistan and that many are in hiding unable to work and having to move regularly to escape assassination units. Two years ago The Mail interviewed 31 former translators in the Afghan capital Kabul who claimed to be in fear of their lives. Out of ten contacted last week, six said they had survived direct threats in recent months. One said : \u2018Many families have been attacked, some relatives killed, others tortured and people loyal to the British military are living in hiding.\u2019 UK officials deny that their translators have been \u2018abandoned\u2019, and stress that each case is individually examined and assessed by British officials in Afghanistan. Asked about Chris\u2019s claims, the Ministry of Defence said it could not discuss individual cases. Taliban henchman accused of murder CAN stay here: Man who 'killed governor's son' in Afghanistan wins right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for The Daily Mail . Home Secretary Theresa May initially rejected the 32-year-old's claim for sanctuary - but immigration judges have now thrown out her decision . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, has admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. Court papers reveal that he was arrested when he was caught trying to desert the Taliban, and accused of killing a provincial governor\u2019s son. The papers go on to say: \u2018The appellant claims he then spent four years in prison but was never formally convicted. He claims he was tortured and beaten.\u2019 SAKA alleges that he managed to escape from prison and eventually travel to the UK. The Home Office was asked to consider whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain \u2018constituted a danger to the community\u2019. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay. It was ruled that deporting him would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Experts said he would be \u2018at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban\u2019. Hearing the case in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban \u2018might be informed \u2019. He would also be at risk from the current Afghan government on the basis of his former membership of the Taliban, she said. Last night a former British commander criticised the judgment and demanded a shake-up of human rights legislation so it could not be exploited by former insurgents. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said: \u2018Our blind adherence to European human rights legislation sees British soldiers who risk their lives to defend us hounded through the courts while this enemy fighter is allowed to stay here to threaten our country. \u2018Our security at home already has enough challenges from jihadists returning from Syria without our own courts wantonly adding to our problems in this way. This case underlines the urgent need to change the law to prevent such dangerous absurdities.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN)The justices of the Supreme Court practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same-sex marriage comes before the court on Tuesday. Public opinion on same-sex marriage has turned upside down since the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003. Overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support, especially among young people of all political persuasions. Even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality. Of course, the Constitution has not changed since 2003, a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same-sex marriage as Justice Antonin Scalia. To originalists like Scalia -- those who believe the Constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage is anathema. To them, the Constitution means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and James Madison (or the authors of the 14th Amendment, just after the Civil War) never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry. But the Supreme Court has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers. And public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race, even though the authors of the 14th Amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, recognized that the world had changed, especially in light of the Cold War. Warren knew that segregated schools damaged the United States' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world, and he steered the court accordingly. Warren's motives had nothing to do with the framers' intentions, and little to do with the words of the Constitution itself, but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the Supreme Court. There are risks, of course, when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the Constitution. Like everyone else, the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women, but she has expressed reservations about the court's decision in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion. She has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway, and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights. Her position is debatable on several scores. Abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the '70s, and opponents were already well mobilized. But Ginsburg's misgivings about Roe have served as an important backdrop to the Supreme Court's consideration of same-sex marriage. Still, when it comes to Supreme Court decisions, it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public. In any case, as we head into the argument, it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds. After the court decided United States v. Windsor in 2013, which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the Defense of Marriage Act, more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same-sex marriage. These judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country. Supporters of the existing laws went to the Supreme Court and asked for stays of the lower court rulings, because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place. But in each case, the Supreme Court denied the stays and allowed same-sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia. In a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues. \"This acquiescence [in allowing marriages to proceed] may well be seen as a signal of the court's intended resolution of that question,\" Thomas wrote. \"This is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities.\" But Thomas only drew Scalia to join his dissent, suggesting that even fellow conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Samuel Alito saw the writing on the wall. In any case, at oral argument, we'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue. But we already know that their decision, like so many in the court's history, will be based on a great deal more than the text of the Constitution.",

        "article": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Her second floor cafe on a dusty industrial road was painted with dashes of psychedelic colors.  And Sabeen Mahmud surrounded herself there with books, people, and discussions on technology, human rights and women's entrepreneurship. Introducing others to Jimi Hendrix, street art, and talking politics was not supposed to get her killed. But in Pakistan, free speech is dangerous, and Mahmud's exuberant exercise of it made her stick out nationwide. Two gunman shot her dead at point-blank range late Friday after she locked up The Second Floor cafe in Karachi for the night, police said. Mahmud died from five bullet wounds. The gunmen also shot her mother. She is in a hospital but is expected to be released on time for her daughter's funeral. Mahmud's killing broke hearts beating for non-violence and progressive values across the country. She freely said what she thought in a place where many people are too afraid to and by doing so spoke for many more people than just herself. She had become a Pakistani figurehead for humanism, love and tolerance. \"She took that torch into the dark forest and so many people followed. She really, truly was a success story of the heart,\" said close friend and BBC journalist Ziad Zafar. No one has claimed responsibility for her shooting, and police have not named any motive. But Mahmud had just finished leading a discussion group on a topic that many want silenced, when the shots fell. In the province of Baluchistan, where separatists have fought a virulent insurgency for years, people have been disappearing regularly. There have been steady allegations of mass abduction. The Lahore University of Management Sciences planned to host the discussion on the topic, with human rights activist Mama Qadeer Baloch, but authorities shut it down. Mahmud would not hear of it not going on. \"Despite the plurality of opinion, very little space seems to be given to the discussion in Pakistani mainstream media or academia; the debate seems to be shut down before it can even begin,\" she posted on Facebook. \"What is the reality? Has the media been silenced on Balochistan? What makes it dangerous for us to talk about Pakistan's largest province at one of our most celebrated universities?\" She invited the discussion to The Second Floor, also known by the shorthand T2F.  She said she knew it was a potentially dangerous move, and she had received death threats in the past when she handled the topic before. \"She was the bravest woman in the world, she really was, she was a brave heart; my God, she was a brave, brave girl,\" Zafar said. Even in its secluded, humble location, T2F was a magnet to those seeking secular wisdom. They found it in a homey setting, musingly decorated like a small town college bookstore. The walls outside its entrance are sprayed with socially critical graffiti -- dusky red hearts float across gray walls. Mahmud waited to greet visitors, many of them young Pakistanis seeking freedom of thought, with a hug, a mug and encouragement for Pakistan's future. \"She hoped the same thing we all hoped for, a place that is fair with liberty and justice for all,\" Zafar said. Grief over her death and gratefulness for her work poured out on social media and via email. \"Thanks for giving us the room to breathe when fog pressed heavy on our shoulders. It's only been a few hours, Sabeen, and the city is already gasping for air,\" a group of illustrators called From Karachi with Love wrote. An artist drew Mahmud puttering off on a Vespa scooter wearing pants, a blouse and sandals. Her tightly coiffed short hair and angular glasses framed her bright-eyed features. Missing was a head scarf. On a wall in T2F is a spray painted Technicolor image of Marilyn Monroe from \"the Seven Year Itch,\" her white dress replaced by a traditional outfit of mustard, ocher and  green. But it still flew up over her hips, revealing her alabaster legs, a daringly sexy and satirical image. The artistic expression sticks out and triggers passions, like many things Mahmud said and did.",

        "article": "Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Days after a horrific Al-Shabaab attack on its soil, Kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in Somalia, according to a military source, who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at Garissa University College that killed nearly 150 people. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether \"you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have.\" \"With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,\" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \"got the job done.\" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. \"Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,\" Mohamed said. \"Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do.\" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a \"most wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. \"This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,\" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of \"Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group.\" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within \"striking distance\" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known \"for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks.\" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. \"The borders historically have been meaningless to them,\" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\" Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Lilian Leposo reported from Garissa; Eliott C. McLaughlin and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta; and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mick Krever, David McKenzie, Dominique van Heerden, Nick Migwi, Ashley Fantz, Florence Obondo, Jessica King and journalist Omar Nor contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Stuart Broad backed Alastair Cook to hit the Test century that has eluded him for 33 innings on Thursday and put England in a winning position in the second Test. Broad produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year to take three wickets for 19 here in Grenada before a defiant last wicket stand of 52 from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel lifted West Indies to 299. Then Cook, fighting for his captaincy in this series, and the under pressure Jonathan Trott joined forces to hit their first half-century partnership as an opening pair and reach 74 without loss by the close of a rain-affected second day. Stuart Broad\u00a0produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year on day two in Grenada . Quick Broad took three wickets on day two as England bowled West Indies out for 299 . Captain Alastair Cook, who won the toss and chose to bowl, worked his way to 37 not out at stumps . Broad backs Cook to go onto a big hundred and get his side in a winning position with three days left . When Cook reached 17 of his unbeaten 37 he went past Alec Stewart to become the second highest run-scorer in England's Test history and now only his mentor in Graham Gooch stands ahead of him. 'He's been an amazing performer for eight or nine years now,' said Broad. 'And he's such a level headed character that you never know whether he's got nought or 200 if you bumped into him in the evening. 'Cooky won't be thinking about personal landmarks now. He knows if he gets a big hundred tomorrow he will set his team up with a fantastic chance of getting a result and it was great to see Cook and Trott back together again.\u00a0Hopefully they can score a lot more runs tomorrow.' Broad revealed that a chat with new bowling coach Ottis Gibson and a change of technique led him to add 10 miles per hour to his bowling overnight and look back to his best. Cook plays a shot to the legside as he found some form on a rain-interrupted day two at St George's . Broad celebrates the wicket of West indies captain Denesh Ramdin, who was caught behind on 31 . 'I made a slight change overnight after watching quite a lot of footage of how I got my wickets and I was a bit wider on the crease which allowed my momentum to go straight through,' said Broad, who touched 91 miles per hour when bowling a beauty to take Denesh Ramdin's wicket. 'It seemed to work and I was really pleased with how I bowled today.' Despite some momentum in the favour of Cook's side, Broad admits England are battling both the weather and an at time defiant West Indies as they look to force victory. With unpredictable forecasts around, Broad knows only full days of cricket and a sizeable first-innings lead will leave the tourists on track. Broad celebrates after reaching 91 miles per hour for the delivery that took Denesh Ramdin's wicket . Cook and Jonathan Trott leave the field at stumps having guided England to 74 runs without loss . 'The only way we can win is by getting 400, 450 in the first innings and applying pressure that way,' he said. 'We need a bit of lady luck, blue skies in the morning and hopefully there's not too much swing. 'You can't have mornings like we've had on every day of the Test or it will be a draw. 'But we've got a pretty simple job from now, which is to bat a day and half to two days because I don't think anyone really knows how this wicket will behave late on day three, four or five.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Pushed to his limits, a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class. In an email to his students, Irwin Horwitz accused them of \"backstabbing, game playing, cheating, lying, fighting.\" The professor at the Texas A&M University Galveston Campus expected his missive would create some conflict, but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly. Those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage. The story went viral. Suddenly, his name was spreading on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, accompanied by the kind of strong, unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you've never met. He was a hero who taught today's entitled youth a much-needed lesson, or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit. One thing was certain: He, and his employer, were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for. \"I did what I did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the Internet,\" Horwitz said. \"I will stand by what I did, but I'm not career suicidal.\" Texas A&M says Horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching. But Horwitz, a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program, is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs. Horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial, and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class. The day before writing to his students, Horwitz wrote a similar email to the CEO of the Texas A&M Galveston Campus and to the school's chief academic officer. \"I have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful, dishonest and disrespectful\" as his current strategic management class, he wrote to the administrators. He accused the students of shirking responsibility, making excuses and complaining their way to better grades. He would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class, Horwitz wrote. \"The class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic,\" he wrote. \"But they are your problem now.\" It was the next day that Horwitz wrote to the students, calling the class \"an embarrassment in general,\" and said that \"I am frankly and completely disgusted.\" Once his words echoed in traditional and social media, the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone. The story was such a talker that even The Onion offered a parody. \"I'm not looking to fail students,\" Horwitz said. \"I don't get a bonus for failing students.\" \"The letter sounded a little bit more definite than I wanted it to,\" he added. He never actually changed anyone's grade. There were some students he wasn't going to fail, he said, and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out. But Horwitz stands by his tough stance; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed, he said. The course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses. \"I had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis,\" the professor said. \"If you cannot do a break-even analysis, then you don't deserve a bachelor's degree in business.\" His other complaint was about professionalism. Horwitz said students would swear at him, cheat and spread rumors about him online. This is related to their grades, he said, because dealing with people you don't like is a business skill. On online message boards, users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story. One purported student called Horwitz \"a little obnoxious,\" but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules. Should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral? The fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public, but maybe there is more to it. The situation hits on a popular argument on the media and Internet: What do we think of millennials? Reflecting on his most recent class, Horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered. He mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics, and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration. The other factor is a failure of K-12 education, said Horwitz, who has met college students who don't know how to convert fractions to decimals. \"What I'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance,\" he said. In a statement, Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at Texas A&M Galveston Campus, said the entire class will not be failed. \"Each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester,\" Louchouarn said. \"The university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies.\" The flurry of attention is unwelcome and Horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia. But it's likely his story will have a short shelf life. People probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline. But he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere. He said he feels a public shaming of sorts. Online public shaming has become a research topic of its own. People who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance. \"This is really destroying my life,\" Horwitz said.",

But that doesn't apply to Lionel Messi. The Barcelona star has scored so many trebles at club level - 32 to be exact - that he can't remember each one despite keeping a match ball from every game. Messi will be hoping to add another to his list when Barca take on PSG in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Lionel Messi poses with each of the 32 balls he has taken home after scoring a hat-trick for Barcelona . Messi bends home his side's opening goal against Sevilla on Saturday during Barcelona's 2-2 draw . Speaking to Barcelona's official magazine\u00a0ahead of the game, Messi revealed that  his hat-trick balls have a special place in his home even if he can't recall which games they're from. Asked about getting each one signed by his team-mates, the 27-year-old said: 'I always sign it because I believe it is recognition for the whole team. 'Without my team mates I would not have achieved all that I have on an individual level and I think that with a hat-trick, more than ever, because I depend on them to score goals, so it is a nice souvenir to have them all sign it. Messi celebrates after scoring against Sevilla - his 34th La Liga goal of the season so far . Messi will lead the line for Barcelona when they take on PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday evening . 'I keep them at home where I keep all my trophies, but I have thought about doing something special with them, something nice with all the footballs. 'At the moment I have them in glass cases but I am thinking about doing something so that they have a more special place.' Having netted 277 La Liga goals for Barcelona over the last 10-and-a-half years, it's little surprise that Messi has some trouble remembering the 96 which arrived in just 32 matches. Asked if he can recall all of his hat-tricks for the club, Messi said: 'Right now, as we speak, no. I need to see the goals again or for somebody to tell me something about them to actually remember them.' Messi celebrates after scoring the second goal of his hat-trick against Real Madrid in March 2007 . Less surprising is the one that stands out to him. 'The one I scored against Real Madrid when we drew 3-3 at Camp Nou was very special for me, for what it meant in the game and because for me it was my first hat-trick and it kept us ahead in the league,' said Messi. 'Even though at the end we didn\u2019t win the league, at that moment it was important and also because it was against Real Madrid.'",

Police, who originally said she was OK, would not describe the extent of her injuries, according to\u00a0KTLA. The girl's mother was too distressed to speak to media. 'She's a pure little innocent baby,' her aunt Grecian Alvarez said. The young girl was discovered sitting alone in the parking lot of a burger restaurant 13 miles away and was scared by male police officers . Police would not describe the extent of the young girl's injuries. Above, the white Nissan was also seen driving in a Gardena neighborhood . Her abductor is believed to be a stranger to the two-year-old. Authorities are looking for the driver of a white, recent-model Nissan Altima captured on video at the car wash the same time the girl was abducted. The driver, who had tinted windows, is believed to be a serial predator. Caesar Alvarez, the girl's uncle, said that she was doing well on Friday. She was taken to St Francis Medical Center for examination.",

        "article": "Stars have flocked to Twitter to praise Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson for revealing that she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by\u00a0People\u00a0magazine on Tuesday. Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress as Katie Couric wrote: 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health.' Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double\u00a0mastectomy . Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' Actress Christina Applegate, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2008, also tweeted: \u2018Sweet beautiful powerful Rita!!! Loving you so much!\u2019 Singer Sara Bareilles wrote: \u2018Beautiful Brave Friend. Thinking of you and grateful for your courage.\u2019 While reality star Lisa Rinna wrote: \u2018Sending love + light to @RitaWilson thank you for Sharing your breast cancer story of getting a second opinion your courage will help many.\u2019 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Best wishes:\u00a0TV presenter Katie Couric, who is a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness following the death of her first husband, John Monahan, was one of the first stars to react on social media . Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . In her statement, Rita explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Brave: The star from the TV, film and music industries all praised her brave decision . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by\u00a0Glenne Headly. Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.",

        "article": "A former New York City investment banker faces trial in eastern Long Island on charges he raped a woman he took home after celebrating his birthday at a Hamptons nightclub. Jason Lee, 38, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, was arrested in August 2013 after the woman accused him of attacking her in a bathroom at the home he had rented with his wife in the summer resort town of East Hampton. Lee has pleaded not guilty and is free on $100,000 bail. He has opted for a non-jury trial before Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn. Charged: Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . Lee's attorney, Manhattan lawyer Andrew Lankler, did not respond to email and telephone messages seeking comment. A lawyer who represented Lee at his arraignment in 2013 said his client was innocent and that the sex was consensual. Prosecutors said Lee was celebrating his birthday at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home for a pool party. The woman, a then-20-year-old Irish student said that once at the house, Lee undressed, forced his way into a bathroom and pinned her to the floor. Scene: This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . Restaurant: The group met at Georgica's restaurant and lounge, pictured, popular with the jetset summer crowd of East Hampton . Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota said the woman was treated at a hospital following the assault. A nurse, who was trained in sexual assault cases, examined the woman after the alleged incident and said her injuries, including bruises, were consistent with her allegations, according to the Irish Times. At the time of the incident, police who arrived at the house reportedly found the banker cowering in his Range Rover. It also emerged Lee's own friend, Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home. Accused: Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . But when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star. A source told the newspaper that Lee then went to the driveway of the $33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers soon found him cowering inside, the source said. One of the other foreign students borrowed Duncan's car to drive home another friend and did not return, prompting Duncan to call the cops. However, the car was found the next day. Spota said the woman was  was working in the U.S. at the time and was visiting her brother in the Hamtons. She is expected to return to the United States from Ireland to testify during the trial. Opening statement are scheduled for Wednesday morning. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said Lee left the firm sometime last year; he had worked in the equity capital markets department.",

        "article": "The chilling details of a 'resurrection ceremony' held for a 'possessed' two-year-old boy in a Texas residence have emerged following the arrest of a pastor who is accused of helping to starve the boy to rid him of a 'demon.' Witnesses told police that pastor Aracely Meza, 49, and the boy's parents believed he had a 'demon' inside of him, and that he was starved for 25 days, being given only water four to five times a day. Church member Nazareth Zurita\u00a0said the toddler, whose name has not been released, fell and hit his head several times, but she hesitated to help him 'due to his demon possession.' The chilling details of a 'resurrection' ceremony held for a 'possessed' two-year-old boy in a Texas residence have emerged following the arrest of a pastor who is accused of helping starve the boy to rid him of a demon (above Aracely Meza during the alleged resurrection holding the two-year-old boy) In the video, Meza is seen next to a man who appears to be her husband Pastor Daniel Meza, as she uses oils and prays while trying to bring the boy, identified by a witness as Benjamin, back to life (above scenes from the attempted resurrection) In the shocking video capturing the 'resurrection ceremony', which reportedly lasted for hours, Meza places oil on the child's head while reciting prayers as she holds him in her arms. In the video, the boy is identified by a witness as Benjamin. Police believe the child was dead during the ceremony but that his parents took his body to their native Mexico for burial without reporting the death, said Balch Springs police Lt. Mark Maret. During the ceremony, Meza invokes Jesus to give life to the child saying 'in the name of Jesus, I\u2019m utilizing this oil to try to get him back to life', according to the Dallas Morning News. Maret said: 'They didn't give the child any food for about 25 days. They just gave him some water, which ultimately caused the child to die.' Delia Guadalupe Oyervides Herrera, another church member, told police she tried several times to feed the child during the 25-day fast, 'but was scolded by the pastors of the church,' according to the affidavit. She asked the child's mother why she would allow her child to be starved and was 'advised that it was God's will.' Meza was charged on Monday with injury to a child by omission. She is currently being held on a $100,000 bond . Meza was charged on Monday  with injury to a child by omission, according to NBCDFW. She is currently being held on a $100,000 bond, a police spokesman told Daily Mail Online on Monday. She was taken into custody for helping starve the child and then holding a resurrection ceremony at the Balch Springs residence shortly after he died to try and revive him, investigators said on Tuesday. Maret said an anonymous tip about the ceremony at Meza's home on Duke Drive - which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church - where several other church members also lived, led to the investigation. He noted that more arrests are likely to follow. 'Apparently, they had a ceremony called \"the rising\" trying to resurrect the child back to life,' said Maret. Zurita said she saw the child 'looking frail and weak' the day before the resurrection ceremony, according to a police affidavit. She said the next time she saw the child was the following day during a ceremony held by church leader Daniel Meza, who is married to Aracely Meza. He was trying to revive the boy through a miracle during the ritual. Zurita, who identified herself as the secretary and third-ranking officer, said 'it took her a while to figure out' the child was dead, according to the affidavit. Police believe the child was dead during the ceremony but that his parents took his body to their native Mexico for burial without reporting the death, said police . A report from earlier this month said that services took place at the residence on Duke Drive which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church with services presided by Daniel and Aracely Meza (both pictured above) Investigators believe the boy died on March 21 or early the next day, and that the ceremony was held March 22 at the residence. Meza 'was considered a prophet' who 'would advise to the other members of the church what God has spoken to her,' according to Zurita. She said Meza's husband was the church's leader and Meza was its second-ranking officer. Last month, police went to the home on March 26 in Balch Springs to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' was performed, according to\u00a0CBS. Meza and her husband are pastors who presided over the church services held at the residence  and also lived there along with other families including that of the two-year-old boy, according to\u00a0WFAA. Witnesses told police the boy went 25 days without food before he died and was only given water four to five times a day . Members of the Igelisa Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church re-enact a scene from the crucifixion which on Facebook was titled as 'Drama Crucifixion & Resurrecci\u00f3n Pascua 2014' In a report earlier this month, neighbors told WFAA\u00a0that cars would fill the street for services, presided by the Mezas, but that no one knew what was happening inside of the home operating also as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church. 'When it was church hours they would set it up as a church, then when it was over, back to a home,' neighbor Bryan Cruz told WFAA who grew up with the children in the home. The home was not registered or zoned to operate as a church, code inspectors for the city said, however its website states the national headquarters are at the home's address. Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later. Police said there is no record of the child's death being reported. The child's parents took the body to Mexico the following day.\u00a0Two phone numbers listed for the single-story home were disconnected. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, (pictured) to do a wellness check and were told that a two-year-old child had died . A neighbor told Daily Mail Online earlier this month that five children under the age of ten, both boys and girls, were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services. Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys, who had been bothering her dogs. The woman, whose name she did not know, told her that the children did not know any better 'because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico'. A second neighbor, Jean Turnipseed, told Daily Mail Online that she had heard  that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights, where people were being charged at the door. Mr Meza along with the boy's parents are a part of the investigation as it continues.",

        "article": "Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.",

        "article": "At last, some good news for Sunderland and Newcastle United \u2014 apparently form goes out of the window in a derby. Now isn\u2019t that a relief? On Sunday afternoon, both sets of supporters will have the chance to suspend the depressing reality of their current plight. Over the course of their last six matches \u2014 12 in total \u2014 the pair have amassed a not-so-mighty six points. During that same period \u2014 18 hours of football, no less \u2014 they have scored four times between them, conceding 22 along the way. It is little wonder they have billed this one \u2018The Desperation Derby\u2019. Perhaps \u2018The Donkey Derby\u2019 would be more apt. John Carver issues instructions to his players during training on Friday ahead of Sunday's derby . Carver put his Newcastle players through their paces during the session at St James' Park . Dick Advocaat wraps up warm as he prepares his Sunderland side for Sunday's crunch clash . Sunderland are the country\u2019s most out-of-form side and, unless new boss Dick Advocaat can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three, they will be back in the Championship come August. Newcastle won\u2019t be, but therein lies the problem. It is job done on Tyneside. The Magpie mandate is survival and little more, a dispiriting acceptance of mediocrity which has permeated a squad in desperate need of overhaul, both in terms of quality and character. The same can be said of a Sunderland side who have won just four times all season. If it wasn\u2019t for the history and intensity of the rivalry, this would have all the appeal of The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion. Perhaps that is being disrespectful to pub teams, however. But, amid all of the gloom, the stakes remain sky high, albeit for different reasons. For Sunderland, it is about survival. Forget their bid for a record-making five straight victories over the enemy. Forget, even, bragging rights. Carver is fighting to secure his future as Newcastle manager beyond the end of this season . Advocaat was all smiles as he attempts to steer Sunderland clear of Premier League relegation . With trips to Arsenal and Chelsea to sign off their dismal season, this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate. Advocaat knows as much and hinted on Friday that he is working on a six-game rescue plan. Their last six have yielded just two points and one goal. Should that sad sequence persist then it will end in a future-defining demotion to the second tier. For never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the Premier League cash-cow. For Newcastle head coach John Carver, it\u2019s about making a point. The outcome of this game will shape his future also. Lose, and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit. \u2018I have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis, I really have, because if I keep worrying about everything that\u2019s going on, if I keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job, then I won\u2019t be giving this my 100 per cent, so I don\u2019t even think about \u201cpermanent\u201d,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018In my eyes, I am permanent. In the contract I signed there was nothing about \u201cshort term\u201d, there was nothing about \u201cinterim\u201d. I am the permanent manager and that\u2019s my mindset on this, so I don\u2019t even think about the summer.\u2019 Newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months . Jermain Defoe, who has scored twice since his return to England, trains with team-mates on Friday . Advocaat, meanwhile, will be gone come June, regardless of which division he leaves Sunderland in. To that end, his reputation is on the line. \u2018If I didn\u2019t think I could do it then I would have said \u201cno\u201d,\u2019 said the 67-year-old, who has never been relegated, as a player or manager. \u2018I need to give the players confidence. I need to be a little bit softer because of the position we\u2019re in, but if they don\u2019t do what I want then they won\u2019t play. \u2018The game against Aston Villa [4-0 home defeat] shows you that something is wrong. They will not play like that under me.\u2019 History is at least on Advocaat\u2019s side. By a quirk of footballing fate, his predecessors \u2014 Paolo di Canio and Gus Poyet \u2014 both won derbies in their second match in charge. \u2018The pressure is on then, yes?\u2019 laughed Advocaat. He may joke and dismiss such coincidence, but those victories both played a part in Sunderland avoiding relegation. Gabriel Obertan (left) closes in on Mehdi Abeid during Friday's training session at St James' Park . Tim Krul works on his handling as he prepares to keep Sunderland out in the Tyne-Weir derby on Sunday . And that is a recurring theme on Wearside \u2014 a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop. At least that, however, offers some perverse excitement for supporters. Up the road at Newcastle, the club who returned profits of \u00a318.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which, mystifyingly, still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis. Anger has made way for apathy at Gallowgate, for fans have accepted that, as long as Mike Ashley remains in power, their lucrative existence \u2014 at least that is for the owner \u2014 resides somewhere between 17th and 10th. For the Toon Army, it is \u2018The Derby of Disillusion\u2019. Indeed, many supporters resent their own club as much as they do their rivals across the river. Throw in Jack Colback returning to the Stadium of Light for the first time since his defection to Newcastle, Sunderland\u2019s Adam Johnson playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick-off in the middle of a Bank Holiday weekend, and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits.

'I am happy. The truth is that I started the season in another way after what happened to me last year,' he said in an interview with Barcelona's club website. 'I was inconsistent last season. I was out for a while due to injury, missing quite a few games. When I came back I didn't feel right. It was a year that I have tried to quickly forget to try and get back to my best through hard work, smiling and effort, like I always have and now, fortunately, I feel very good.'

But should we be drinking our way to flawless skin? If the latest Japanese beauty trend is anything to go by, it seems so.

Japanese women swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy and prefer to sip on tincture tonics to beat acne - and the beauty movement is coming to the UK . Indeed, Mahonia,\u00a0a traditional herbal treatment for acne, is a number one bestseller in the East Asian nation, reports Neal's Yard Remedies, who has seen sales of its Mahonia Clear Skin Formula go through the roof online from customers there. Mahonia, which is also known as Oregon Mountain Grape, is a berry native to the Rocky Mountains that's been used by tribes for medicinal, food, and ceremonial needs for years. It contains high levels of alkaloids, berberine and hydrastine, which are active compounds that give it antibacterial and anti-inflammatory  benefits. Thanks to these benefits, mahonia has been used traditionally for skin itchiness, infections and irritations, and is highly recommended for acne.

The antibacterial compounds in this herb are berbamine and berberine, which are antiseptic when used topically. When used internally, these compounds are liver tonics that improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall. Neal's Yard Remedies created a tincture packed with the stuff, as well as a purifying blend of the skin-loving botanicals calendula, schisandra and gotu kola. Gotu kola helps stimulate collagen and tissue formation. It improves circulation, which benefits skin tone, and  has anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating actions. When used internally, mahonia can improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall . Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within. It is recommended to add 2ml to a cupful of water three times a day to reap the rewards.",

        "article": "He rarely ever publicly criticizes his successor, Barack Obama. But on Saturday night, George W. Bush apparently lashed out at the President's foreign policy. Speaking at a closed-door meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas,  the 68-year-old former leader suggested that Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early. He noted that the country's government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in - and implied that America could lose leverage if it relaxes sanctions on Tehran anytime soon. And he said that the comprehensive nuclear deal - which is currently being negotiated by six global powers, including the US - would likely have a negative impact on US national security in the future. Scroll down for video . Rare remarks: Speaking at a  meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas, George W Bush (pictured) suggested that President Barack Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early . 'You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That\u2019s how Americans should view the deal,' Bush told donors at the Republican Jewish Coalition session. Bush's concerns are in stark contrast to Obama's belief that although the contents of the agreement - which were announced at the start of April -\u00a0'may not be optimal,' they are America's 'best bet'. In an interview with the New York Times, Obama remarked: 'This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon.' But he noted the deal could see 'real political difficulties'. Bush's administration initially began the diplomatic effort to confront the Iranian regime about its nuclear program. He also made attempts early in his administration to negotiate with North Korea. During his comments on Saturday, transcribed by an attendee at the event at the Venetian Hotel and obtained by\u00a0Bloomberg, the former president told donors that he would not criticize Obama. He congratulated his successor on his ambition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and beheaded US journalists on video last year. Leaders: Bush, who rarely ever publicly criticizes Obama, noted that the Iranian government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in. Above, Bush, left, greets Obama in Selma, Alabama, in March . Terror group: Bush initially congratulated his successor on his aim to degrade and destroy the Islamic State. But he went on to imply that Obama has failed to keep his promises and is losing the war against the group . But he then went on to suggest that Obama had failed to follow through on his promises, saying that one of the key issues was that the Democrat did not develop a military strategy to defeat the terror group. 'In order to be an effective president ... when you say something you have to mean it,' he said, according to Bloomberg, implying that Obama is losing the war against ISIS. 'You gotta kill em.' Bush even reportedly touted his own success in capturing Islamic terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and countless others. In relation to Obama's decision to withdraw all American troops from Iraq in 2011, Bush cited Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who has publicly criticized the President's foreign policy. He quoted him as saying: 'Pulling out of Iraq was a strategic blunder,' according to theNew York Times, which collected accounts of Bush's comments from around 12 people at the session. A dangerous last name? Bush apparently remarked that his brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush (above) could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties . Bush's comments followed an interview with CBS News last November in which he suggested that the draw down of troops in the war-torn country had allowed ISIS to flourish and recruit more militants. Speaking to news station in a two-part interview, the politician said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that\u2026a violent group of people have risen up again\u2026This is \"Al-Qaeda plus\"\u2026they need to be defeated. And I hope we do\u2026I hope the strategy works.' During Saturday's question-and-answer session, Bush also told anecdotes about his old friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he said had once told him that his dog was 'bigger, stronger and faster' than Bush's own. Bush considered the  comparison to show Putin did not think in 'win-win' terms, he said. He also apparently remarked that his  brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush, could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties. And he called Hillary Rodham Clinton 'formidable', but beatable, the Times reported. The session was attended by Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who owns the Venetian hotel. It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York on Monday, according to a senior State Department official. Kerry, who will be participating in a nuclear non-proliferation conference that opens at the United Nations on Monday, will also apparently meet with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. And he will spend time with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, the official said.",

The study of 1,302 German couples found working men did just two hours of house work each day, which almost doubled to 3.9 hours when they retired. But they are still lagging behind their stay-at-home female partners when it comes to sharing the burden. Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives . The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement. The research noted the increase in the men's hours was mainly taken up by more 'manly' chores - like repairs and gardening. However, the study - conducted by Thomas Leopold at the University of Amsterdam and Jan Skopek at the European University Institute - does not reveal how the burden was shared when both the husband and wife were working.

The former Manchester United defender believes his former club, Chelsea and Arsenal would be a preferable option now for a big star looking to switch to the Premier League. Neville wrote in his Telegraph column that should a player such as Paul Pogba or Mats Hummels decide on a move to England, they are unlikely to select the Etihad as their destination - now that Manuel Pellegrini's side have been reined in by Financial Fair Play. Gary Neville believes Manchester City would now struggle to attract top players thanks to financial restrictions . Players such as Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels (left) and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba would prefer to go to one of Manchester City's Premier League rivals, according to Neville . Neville believes Manchester City need to be bold and take on UEFA's FFP regulations . 'Unless City are bold and decide to take on Uefa\u2019s Financial Fair Play regulations, they will find it difficult to compete with United, Chelsea and Arsenal for the players I believe could make the difference in next season\u2019s title race,' said Neville. 'If any of the top four is able to add Gareth Bale, Morgan Schneiderlin and/or Paul Pogba and Mats Hummels to their squad this summer, they would instantly become front-runners to win the Premier League next year. 'There will be an intense fight between all of the top four clubs to secure the best players, but if that battle takes place on an even playing field, I don\u2019t see how City can come out on top. 'The landscape has changed since City were able to blow everybody out of the water by paying big fees and big wages to sign the likes of Carlos Tevez, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri.' Manchester City have previously manager to attract the likes of Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez . Manchester United had to blitz the market and sign the likes of Angel di Maria last summer . He added: 'FFP has reined City back in and United and Arsenal have upped the ante by spending big themselves and raising the ceiling of their pay structures. 'When United were faced with the Doomsday scenario of being out of the Champions League last summer, they had to blitz the market to sign the likes of Angel di Maria, simply because they had to throw money at the problem they found themselves in. 'And that is big issue facing City this summer -- United, Chelsea and Arsenal are now all capable of taking them on in the transfer market and, if a player has a straight choice between the four clubs, City will come fourth every time.'

The Ukip leader will say the boatloads of people trying to get to the continent from North Africa could provide a cover for jihadis wanting to do harm. Mr Farage will make his comments in a debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the wake of more than 1,000 migrants drowning in the Mediterranean. Scroll down for video . Warning:\u00a0The Ukip leader will say the boatloads of people trying to get to the continent from North Africa could provide a cover for jihadis . He will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain. A source close to Mr Farage said he was taking time out from the campaign trail in Britain to focus the election debate on immigration. Campaign bosses believe a provocative intervention could have the same effect as his controversial remarks on foreigners with HIV being treated in Britain \u2013 which were part of a so-called \u2018shock and awful\u2019 strategy to get attention and appeal to the party\u2019s \u2018core voters\u2019. Mr Farage thinks his party could still get more than ten MPs if he manages to cause a \u2018big shock\u2019 in the eight days before polling day. A senior Ukip aide said: \u2018He needs to make a special intervention. This is a big moment in the campaign. \u2018Cameron and Miliband do not want to talk about this because they know the whole issue hinges on EU membership. \u2018Nigel is going to highlight how jihadis are entering Europe, getting EU passports, and then are able to easily come to Britain because of the open-borders policy. 'If there is going to be one country where these guys are going to head to, it is going to be us because of the Iraq war and our involvement in Afghanistan and against Islamic State.\u2019 Mr Farage said yesterday he opposed EU action to tackle migrant deaths in the Mediterranean because it could lead to a common migration policy and let millions of people into Britain. He added that the problem had the potential to be more damaging than the eurozone crisis. Mr Farage will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain . \u2018I think what is happening in Strasbourg is far more significant than anything that has been said by any of the party leaders about immigration \u2026 during this campaign,\u2019 he said. \u2018They utterly refuse to accept that we are no longer in control of our borders \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m quite certain Miliband and Cameron will try and ignore this, so I am going there [Strasbourg] to engage in that debate and make sure they cannot ignore it.\u2019 He added: \u2018Are we about to see one of the great Brussels dreams come true \u2026 a common EU immigration policy?

        "article": "The RSPCA is considering abandoning its controversial policy of 'pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions' after the collapse of the latest case. The animal charity has no more legal actions left under the Hunting Act after its decision last month to drop the case against William Bryer, joint master of the renowned Cattistock Hunt in Dorset. Following criticism for spending \u00a322.5million pursuing animal welfare prosecutions last year, the RSPCA is now reviewing its policy on fox hunting cases. The RSPCA is considering abandoning its controversial policy of 'pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions' after the collapse of the latest case (file picture of the Boxing Day hunt in Lacock, Wiltshire) The RSPCA has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). However last October, a report commissioned by the charity recommended abandoning the policy and leaving the job to the CPS, which has more expertise. The organisation stressed that its main role is to focus on the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of animals, rather than taking people to court. A spokesman said: 'One of the questions we are currently looking into it whether or not we continue to prosecute under the Hunting Act.' Fox hunting was outlawed in 2005 under Tony Blair's government, but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting, usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of a fox across fields and woodlands. Other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out the animals from woodland which can then be shot. There were more than 400 prosecutions under the controversial Hunting Act between 2009 and 2013. Just 49 people were charged with hunting offences in 2005, but this more than doubled to 110 by 2010. The animal charity has no more legal actions left under the Hunting Act after its decision last month to drop the case against William Bryer, joint master of the renowned Cattistock Hunt (pictured) in Dorset . Fox hunting with dogs was outlawed in 2005 under Tony Blair's government, but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting (file picture) However critics claim many of these people are prosecuted under the Hunting Act for poaching offences, rather than fox hunting, and that hardly any are from official hunts. In 2012, the RSPCA spent \u00a3327,000 prosecuting the Heythrop Hunt, in Oxfordshire. David Cameron has ridden with the hunt. Three defendants were accused of interfering with a badger sett while assisting the Cheshire Hunt in February 2012. A year later the RSPCA admitted it did not have enough evidence. Defendants\u2019 costs of up to \u00a310,000 paid by the taxpayer. In April 2013, charity accused two defendants in the Cheshire Forest Hunt of disturbing a badger sett but ten months later offered \u2018no evidence\u2019. In November 2013, case against Will Goffe, 33, of the Ledbury Hunt, near Malvern in Worcestershire, was dropped due to insufficient evidence. Last month Mr Bryer's case collapsed after the RSPCA pulled out of a three-year battle to prove he had broken hunting laws. His solicitor, Jamie Foster, claimed that the case had been flawed from the start. He said: 'There is video footage of my client laying legal trails before and after the alleged breach of the hunting ban which was not disclosed to us by the RSPCA.' He said the laying of a trail, or a scent which the hounds can track rather than chasing a live animal, showed that the Cattistock had behaved responsibly, not recklessly as the prosecution claimed. Tim Bonner, from the Countryside Alliance, said: 'We would welcome any decision by the RSPCA to leave the question of prosecuting hunts to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. 'The Society has always faced a fundamental difficulty acting as a prosecutor while also being a political campaigning organisation. It can only be in the best interests of animal welfare that the RSPCA returns to its core principles rather than pursuing pointless prosecutions through the courts.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Whilst we have not changed our policy on prosecuting alleged offences under the Hunting Act we don't have any other hunt cases pending at the moment.'",

        "article": "(CNN)How can more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls simply disappear? And how can the Nigerian government and the rest of the world have allowed this to happen? Exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. They are still missing. For this we should all feel shame: shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs. Shame that when such horrendous acts occur, our collective attention span is so fleeting. A year ago, I could never have imagined that we would be here today, marking the grim 12-month milestone of these girls going missing. In the early days of their abduction much of the world stood as one, rallying around the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. On the ground in Nigeria as part of CNN's team covering the story, I was buoyed by this global solidarity. A year on, meet the man still fighting to #BringBackOurGirls . Caught in the blinding glare of global attention, and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings, the Nigerian government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action; offers of assistance from the likes of the US, UK, France, and China were accepted. Promise after promise was made by Nigerian government officials that the girls would come home -- so where are they, and where is the global outrage over these broken promises and broken dreams? My heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary. Poor and socially marginalized, all many of them have is their hope that their girls will one day return. Girls who escaped risk lives to go to school . The task of keeping that hope alive has largely been taken up by the handful of #BringBackOurGirls campaigners in Nigeria. These men and women have worked tirelessly to keep the story alive for the past year; their struggle has been a painful and increasingly lonely one. But as the world's gaze has shifted they have continued to meet the Nigerian government's silence with cries of: \"Bring Back Our Girls, now and alive!\" At this point, finding the girls will not be easy. But it can be done. It must be done. Malala offers 'solidarity, love, hope' to abducted schoolgirls .

        "article": "No matter how young or old we are, most of us experience the odd memory lapse. Perhaps it will be forgetting where you put the car keys, or what you went to get from upstairs. Thankfully, these moments pass. But for those with dementia there is no such relief. Imagine what it's like being unable to recall what you'd done an hour before. Or not remembering how to navigate around your own house or the names of your nearest and dearest. Or knowing what everyday things are for, such as a fridge. Today, in the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia, we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems, to prolong independence and help those with dementia live as full a life as possible. Scroll down for video . Older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep - but they still need just as much . THINGS THAT SABOTAGE YOUR MEMORY . Getting overtired: If the brain is tired, it affects the memory even for those without dementia. Recently, scientists have found out why. During deep sleep, brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short-term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain, where long-term memories are stored. If this doesn't happen, short-term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness, according to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. It is a common misconception that we need less sleep as we get older - in fact we need just as much, the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep. Getting a good night's sleep can be especially difficult for those with dementia, especially those with Alzheimer's disease who may experience changes to their sleeping patterns. Quite why this happens is not understood, but it may be related to the impact the condition has on the brain. But there are steps that can make it easier. One of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day (this becomes harder to avoid as dementia becomes more advanced). Catnapping makes it both harder to fall asleep at night and more likely you'll wake up earlier than desired. Other steps include avoiding caffeine - coffee or tea - in the evening. A regular bedtime is also important as this gives the body the cues it needs to feel sleepy at set times, making it easier to fall asleep. Although many people believe a nightcap will help them sleep, alcohol is counter-productive and tends to make you wake in the night. It is a diuretic and, therefore, you are likely to wake up needing to go to the loo. It is also known to reduce the amount of the night you spend in deep, restorative sleep. Regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus . Eating too much junk food: Cakes, chips and biscuits won't just impact on the waistline - they can adversely affect your memory, too. Recent research has found that regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus. Scientists at the University of New South Wales, Australia, found that eating these foods every day caused inflammation in the brain after just one week. The work was done on rats, but it is thought the principle could extend to humans. Smoking: Many studies have found that even occasional smoking can impact on the brain. One study, from King's College London, analysed 8,000 over-50s and found that smokers performed worst in memory tests, learning ability and reasoning. Why this happens is thought to be linked to the fact that smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain. Those who have smoked have also been shown to have greater overall shrinkage of the brain. Not 'using it': When someone is diagnosed with dementia, they often start to withdraw from their normal hobbies and activities. Yet to retain your mental ability and memory skills for as long as possible you need to keep the brain stimulated. Think of it this way: just as our bodies need physical exercise in order to stay as strong as possible so, too, do our brains. It's a tried-and-tested principle: for example, a review of 15 studies by the respected Cochrane Library looked at the benefits of a variety of activities designed to stimulate the brain and promote memory such as word games, puzzles, listening to music and practical activities such as baking and indoor gardening. The studies involved 718 participants with dementia - some took part in these activities and others did not. After between one and three months those who'd taken part in the brain stimulating and practical activities did better on cognitive function tests than those who did not. TIPS TO HELP WITH A FAILING MEMORY . A failing short-term memory is a characteristic of dementia and can make it difficult to cope with day-to-day life. The following strategies may help: . One of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day . Have set meal times, as these are easier to remember - and write them down on a whiteboard to help recall what time is meal time. The Mediterranean type of diet may be most beneficial as it's been shown to maintain the health of the blood vessels, and keeping a healthy circulation is key for people with dementia as it ensures a healthy flow of blood to the brain. Try to include oily fish such as trout, salmon or mackerel three times a week: the latest research suggests this is a good way to stop brain shrinkage. These fish contain omega-3 fatty acids and research has found that people with the highest level of these have less shrinkage in the hippocampus, the area associated with memory. To confirm a diagnosis of dementia or to access specialist services, a GP can refer a patient to a memory clinic. Normally, these are based either at a community clinic or at a hospital. They will have a team of psychologist nurses and doctors. As well as running tests that can help provide a diagnosis, they co-ordinate a range of services to help the dementia patient. For example, all clinics will offer cognitive stimulation therapy. This takes the form of group activities and exercises the patient is invited to attend twice a week for seven weeks. These activities could involve word games or even singing and have been found to help improve language skills and comprehension. Each session lasts for about 45 minutes. You cannot simply attend a clinic - you need to be referred. Typically, there is a four-to-six week wait after referral for an appointment. If the patient is too infirm or incapacitated to attend, most clinics can offer a home assessment by one of the community mental health team. Do it in chronological order. Having a history of their life can help them remember and, as the condition progresses this book may also be useful to bring out to show them if they seem distressed. Asking the person with dementia to reminisce and recall stories about the people or events shown in the pictures can also be a good way to 'use it'.

        "article": "Chelsea are discussing the possibility of a post-season tour, a move that could upset numerous international managers. Jose Mourinho didn't rule out a potential 12,000-mile round trip to Japan, home of new sponsors Yokohama Rubber, . No final decision has been made on a destination but if a tour goes ahead, the squad is likely to fly out on either May 28 or 29 for a two-match, week-long trip. Jose Mourinho did not rule out the prospect of a 12,000-mile round trip for a pre-season tour in Japan . The news may concern a string of international bosses who will be relying on Chelsea players for their mid-June friendlies and qualifiers. For instance, Belgium face France in a friendly on June 7 before a vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales on June 12. England, Spain and Serbia, who all have Chelsea players in their squads, all have games between June 12-14. Likewise, the proposed tour would also have implications for Chelsea's South American contingent, including Oscar, Willian and Juan Cuadrado, ahead of the Copa America on June 11. FIFA rules state that nations are entitled to players 14 days before the start of a tournament. It is highly likely that those players involved in the Copa America would be given permission to miss Chelsea's post-season tour. Chelsea are yet to finalise plans for their pre-season as they lead the way at the top of the Premier League . Mourinho said: 'I think we'll go on an after-season tour to play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions, if we win it. 'It's something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade, but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. 'Mr Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea. 'Japan? I don't know but that would make some sense.'",

        "article": "EU leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the Mediterranean \u2013 with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols. After years of dithering, an emergency EU summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. Within days, British warship\u00a0HMS Bulwark and the German supply ship Berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the European Union's belated commitment to the cause. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue, stressed that Britain was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the UK. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea, called the EU measures 'a giant step forward.' But other EU leaders were less optimistic, with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying the assets being proposed would 'never be enough' to address the problem. 'A giant step forward': Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi speaks after EU leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols . Jovial: Danish Prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt and her British counterpart David Cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a European Union leaders summit in Brussels . The pledge of resources came as victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried Thursday in Malta. Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. For several years as death tolls mounted, EU leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action. When Libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring countries, Europe failed to take forceful action. Yesterday, EU leaders pledged to do more, committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need. Other member states, from France to Latvia, also lined up more ships, planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants. The member states agreed to triple funding to \u20ac9million (\u00a37m) a month for the EU's border operation that patrols the Mediterranean. Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . Escalating crisis: A migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the Italian Red Cross at the port of Salerno after being rescued by the tanker Chimera along with 545 other refugees in the Mediterranean . They also assigned EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers. Officials said the lack of a strong Libyan government would likely make UN backing necessary. 'Leaders have already pledged significantly greater support, including many more vessels, aircraft and experts' than had been anticipated before the summit, EU President Donald Tusk said. Despite the sudden deluge of goodwill, huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers. 'Right now, it's a question of fixing yesterday's errors,' French President Francois Hollande said. He said the EU would hold a summit in Malta with African countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years. In contrast to the Italian premier, the head of another Mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic. For tiny Malta, the smallest EU member state with a population of 450,000, the summit produced nothing particularly new, apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks. The assets being proposed 'will never be enough,' Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat said. 'It is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by.' On the offensive: EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (pictured) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers . In the past week alone, more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between Italy and Libya as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing. At least 1,300 people have died in April alone, putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever. Ending that is Europe's main challenge. Even optimists say any measures agreed at Thursday's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the Mediterranean. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insisted that Europe should not take the brunt of blame. 'We also ask that Africa, the source of the problem, also collectively takes up its responsibility,' Rutte said. 'Last time I checked Libya was in Africa, not Europe.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive at an EU emergency summit in Brussels seeking a solution to the migrants crisis . Over the past year, what little political structure Libya had has collapsed. There are two rival governments, neither with any real authority, and each fighting the other on the ground. Local militias hold sway around the country, some of them with hard-line Islamist ideologies, and the Islamic State group has emerged as a strong and brutal force. The makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated. 'Any kind of military action can only be based on international law,' said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'There are two possibilities: either a U.N. Security Council Resolution or a unity government in Libya. We have neither at the moment.' Europe itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants. Countries like Germany, Sweden, France and Italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and Baltic member states take hardly any. Five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in. Still, despite the differences, Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb was hopeful that this time Europe could put up a show of solidarity. 'I hope we'll get it right this time,' he said.",

Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of \u2018de-planing\u2019 (don\u2019t they mean \u2018disembarking\u2019 or \u2018getting off\u2019)? Railway stations are described as \u2018calling points\u2019. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians \u2018jubilating\u2019 after the country\u2019s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called \u2018stake-holders\u2019. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the \u2018re-sealable\u2019 bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: \u2018It doesn\u2019t work!\u2019 \u2018Re-sealable\u2019 bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil\u2019s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream \u2014 turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it\u2019s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I\u2019m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I\u2019d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be \u2018dad\u2019 jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I\u2019m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I\u2019ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn\u2019t resemble an old shoe sole. And don\u2019t bother writing in with your tips, I\u2019ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don\u2019t ever call me Janice! In America, I\u2019m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that\u2019s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning \u2014 folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day\u2019s setting to the next day \u2026 I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the \u2018hospitality industry\u2019, it\u2019s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me \u00a3200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you\u2019ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it\u2019s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam \u2014you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven\u2019t had a baby, only four husbands \u2014 but I don\u2019t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone\u2019s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We\u2019ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a \u2018train manager\u2019!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the \u2018on-board caf\u00e9\u2019.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There\u2019s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn\u2019t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly. Being confronted by an embarrassed 16-year-old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining!",

        "article": "Patrice Evra believes Juventus called upon quintessential Italian traits in securing their route to the Champions League semi-finals, describing the Sere A side's defeat of Monaco as  'ugly'. Massimiliano Allegri's team secured a 0-0 draw at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday night, meaning they progressed 1-0 on aggregate, after  Arturo Vidal's second-half penalty proved the difference in Turin last week. Evra withstood a few nervous moments as Juventus sat back and allowed the French side to dictate the play, but after helping the Italians reach their first Champions League semi-final since 2002-03, the former Manchester United full back claimed that Ligue 1's elite clubs could learn from a more combative style of play. Patrice Evra prevents Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco from delivering a cross at the\u00a0Stade Louis II . Evra is put under pressure by Monaco's Geoffrey Kondogbia during Wednesday night's quarter-final clash . 'I'm not scientist but for Paris Saint-Germain to lose to a big club like Barcelona and Monaco to lose to an experienced team like Juventus, but I think that in France we're okay being the country that finishes second,' the French defender told beIN Sports after the game. 'We'll have to take the next step, to have a different mentality. You have to respect the opponent but be more aggressive on the pitch. 'I think the French teams sometimes doubt themselves. They play some beautiful games but when it comes down to it, do not go through. 'We must give a nod to Monaco, who deserved more tonight. But, from our point of view, we never really doubted ourselves. 'We played the Italian way - it's solid, it's ugly, but it works. I am happy and at the same time a little sad for Monaco. It was strange to return to Stade Louis II, where I spent many happy years.' Injury meant Paul Pogba sat out the Monaco clash and he is likely to miss the Champions League semi-finals . Meanwhile, Evra's has urged compatriot Paul Pogba not to be tempted into a swift comeback from injury, after the 22-year-old was ruled out of action for 50 days when he injured a hamstring in the last-16 victory over Borussia Dortmund. 'He's hungry but he has an injury that requires attention,' the left-back added. 'He must not rush his return and instead have faith in the medical staff. He must only return if he's 100 per cent.'",

'We agreed that we would all be signatories on the final contract and then they sent us a draft of the agreement and it excluded us,' Arum said.

'If I am having a bad day at work I just forget about it when I open my parachute. 'I am so happy I scream - it's such a thrill. 'I have always loved extreme sports and when I was in France I had a motorcycle. 'One of my friends suggested I try skydiving and when ten of us went I was the only one who said I was coming back, I became obsessed.

Biso had squeezed into the hole in the wall at the Mohamed Naguib metro station as a kitten in 2010 - but then soon became to big to escape. He survived thanks to an elderly man named Uncle Abdo, who gave the trapped cat water and fed him scraps of food  every day. Scroll down for video . Biso the cat, who was stuck behind a wall in a Cairo train station for five years, has finally been freed . The cat survived thanks to an elderly man called Uncle Abdo who fed him scraps of food every day . Now, the feline in finally free thanks to a social media campaign, according to the Cairo Post. Animal rights activist\u00a0Mounira Shehata told the newspaper the smell when the wall was removed was 'heinous'. She said: 'It was like a tomb. There were black worms along four meters of the edge, where Uncle Abdo was able to put in food for Biso.' Uncle Abdo, who named the cat, said Biso would regularly hide from bigger cats in the hole, but one day, squeezed inside and was not able to come out again. He added that workers had tried to rescue the cat years ago, but a scared Biso had stayed behind the wall. And Uncle Abdo even visited the station to feed Biso during the revolution in Egypt in 2011, when most stores, including his own, were closed. Uncle Abdo even came to feed Biso during the the revolution in Egypt in 2011, when his shop was closed . 'I do it for God. What is for God does not go away,' he told Masr al-Arabia. Biso's plight came to the attention of animal activists after a picture of the cat's tail hanging from behind the wall was posted on Facebook last month. A caption explained that the wall could not be broken to free the animal because it would be considered damage to public property. The picture caught the attention of Ms Shehata and her fellow animal rights activists Marwa Elgebaly and\u00a0Rania el-Kordy - who all decided to go save the cat on March 12. Staff at the station told the trio they would need to return a couple of days later, when a maintenance official would be able to help. And after Dina Zulfikar, an animal rights worker, filed a report at the Abdeen police station March 13, officers arrived at the metro station. Biso's plight came to the attention of animal activists after a picture of his tail was posted on Facebook . But the terrified cat quickly ran off after his rescue from behind the wall at the Mohamed Naguib metro station . They told the head of Mohamed Naguib metro station, in downtown Cairo, of the prosecution order to rescue Biso. Workers were brought in to help - and the rescue mission took more than five hours. The terrified cat only emerged from the hole after one worker, named Amr, went inside to bring him out. Sadly, Biso then quickly ran away before anyone was able to catch him. Uncle Abdo is still looking for him inside the station.",

        "article": "Defeated: Napoleon (illustrated) lost at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . Guests attending a service in London to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo have been told not to act in a 'triumphalist' way \u2013 to avoid upsetting the French. Invitations to the service at St Paul's Cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the Duke of Wellington's historic victory over Napoleon in 1815. But last night the move was criticised by politicians, who said it 'took political correctness to an absurd new degree'. The invitation to the Waterloo 200 event says: 'The service, although related to a military victory, is not in any way glorifying war, nor must it be seen as triumphalist.' Instead, the service \u2013 to be attended by members of the Royal Family and senior political and military figures \u2013 will focus on the 'pan-European' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed. Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is bidding to be re-elected as a Somerset MP, said: 'Waterloo was a triumph of good versus evil. Napoleon was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths. 'Two hundred years on, it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the French by not celebrating the battle for what it was. What next? Will we ask France to apologise for the Battle of Hastings?' The service of commemoration, to take place on the 200th anniversary of Waterloo on June 18, will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle. Waterloo 200 chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, defended the 'no triumphalism' theme. Asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the French, he said: 'Some people may read it like that but it's not how we look at it.' He added that the enemy at Waterloo was Napoleon \u2013 not France as such. The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on Europe, not the military campaign or the battle itself. 'What Waterloo brought in was an extended period of peace in Europe after a particularly horrible 20 years of war,' Sir Evelyn said. 'The commemoration looks forward to the European harmony that followed it.' Colin Brown, author of Scum Of The Earth, a new book about Waterloo, said Wellington would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone. He added: 'The Duke strongly believed in the restoration of the status quo after the battle, including the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France.' The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle (illustrated) on Europe, organisers said .",

        "article": "Tim Sherwood returned to White Hart Lane with his Aston Villa side on Saturday and recorded a hugely important 1-0 victory against Tottenham to dramatically increase his team's chances of Premier League survival. Sherwood is renowned for his fiery displays on the touchline, so how did he fare during what is undoubtedly one of the more emotive fixtures for him? Sportsmail explains... Tim Sherwood was visibly delighted at recording a victory with Aston Villa against Tottenham . CROWD REACTION . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, as the overmatched Vlad Chiriches bore the brunt of the home crowd's frustration before he was hooked in the 78th minute. Gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches (left) bore the brunt of the home fans' dismay against Villa . TOUCHLINE BEHAVIOUR . The bright spring day in N17 allowed to him leave his gillet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored what proved to be the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle. Clearly still loves having a go at 4th official, who got an earful on occasion. Christian Benteke (centre) headed the winning goal for Villa on the 35th minute at White Hart Lane . Sherwood coud not resist a lively celebration when the final whistle confirmed the victory for Villa . Told someone on the Spurs bench to 'shut the f*** up' as tempers flared on the bench during stoppage time. INTERACTION . Very little on this front with Tony Parks, who was one of his lieutenants here at Spurs, doing most of the talking. Stayed ice cool throughout although did nearly hit the roof when Andreas Weimann shot tamely at Michel Vorm with five minutes to go. Sherwood (centre) celebrated in a subdued manner when Benteke's header found the back of the net . Sherwood (left) and assistant Tony Parks were lively throughout the game on the touchline . Did not even acknowledge Sanchez as he meandered down the following his stoppage time red card. TACTICS . Like he did here with Emmanuel Adebayor, Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Christian Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second half Spurs fight back, although it never seemed to come. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after hitting the back of the net for Villa at Tottenham . Sherwood has helped Belgium striker Benteke rediscover his scoring form since taking over . VERDICT . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points for his side. Looks a different, more relaxed man to the one who could be spotted in the home technical area here during the second half of last season. Although he showed a glimpse of the old Tim at the final whistle as his side took a step closer to Premier League safety.

Meanwhile, sales of Pacquiao merchandise have soared 10-fold in the build-up to the fight, with retailers in his native Philippines struggling to keep up with demand.

        "article": "The performance of Jimmy Anderson on the last morning of the second Test was one of the greatest I have seen from an England cricketer. He did everything right as a bowler, catcher and fielder. It was Botham-esque. England must be doing something right behind the scenes if one of their players can produce something like that almost out of nothing. Sessions that win matches do not happen purely by chance. When something like that happens it\u2019s very hard to adhere to the old mantra of not getting too up when things go well and not too low when they go badly. England captain Alastair Cook celebrates as he scores the runs to defeat West Indies in the second Test . Cook (left) dives to his left to take a catch at first slip and claim the wicket of Chanderpaul . England must remember that, having won a crucial toss, they had the best conditions against the eighth-ranked side in the world. But this was a win to savour. Anderson may have won it with his extraordinary display but the key to me in England going one-up was the captaincy and batting of Alastair Cook. There were times during the Ashes when it was very clear who was leading Australia on the field but not so obvious who was in charge of England. Arms were being waved everywhere and, if you did not know Cook was the England captain, you would never have guessed it from watching them. Yet now he looks completely in charge of this England team. Whether it is because he has a young team or whether he has simply said, \u2018Sod it, I\u2019ve taken a lot of criticism and now I\u2019m going to do it my way,\u2019 I don\u2019t know. But even on the fourth evening when West Indies were only two down and the match looked destined to be a draw Cook was still impressive in the field. He seems to be on top of the big two senior bowlers in Anderson and Stuart Broad, as was made clear in the first Test when he had a little argument over fielding positions with Anderson and very much got his own way. James Anderson (left) celebrates the dismissal of West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels . Cook (left) celebrates with team-mate Gary Ballance (right) during the second test last week . And it makes such a massive difference to the captain if he is scoring runs. Everything becomes clearer and you do not have to fret over your place. OK, Cook hasn\u2019t scored that elusive century yet and the big test will come when he faces the moving ball again but for now his game looks in very good order again and he is making very good half-centuries. You have to say that it suits the way England play to be up against West Indies. England like to sit in, be patient and build pressure on a side. West Indies are perfect for that because they are not coming at England in this series. Cook appears to have learnt from his mistakes. Last summer, for instance, his decision to spread the field when Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was batting with the tail lost England the Headingley Test but here he kept the field up to Denesh Ramdin in a similar situation and kept the pressure on. Cook (right) kicks the wicket in frustration after being dismissed for 13 runs against \u00a0the West Indies . The test, of course, will come when Brad Haddin is flailing it to all parts at some point this summer and the wheels are coming off Anderson and Broad. That is when Cook will need to show the same presence and leadership. For now there is a lot for Cook and England to be pleased about, not least the batting of Joe Root and Gary Ballance who are breaking all sorts of records at such a young age. Ballance may not always be easy on the eye but who cares? He gets the job done. There is, of course, still work to be done and there is clearly a concern over Jonathan Trott going into Friday\u2019s third Test. Trott was frenetic again at the start of his second innings, having looked much more like his old self as he spent time at the crease first time round. As I said before the second Test, he needs to be given the whole of this series before England make a decision on him. If he can bring his old calmness to the start of his innings as an opener, England will have a very good player back in the side. But if he continues to be too frenetic in Barbados then England might have to think again at the start of a huge summer when life will get much tougher.",
        "highlights": "Jimmy Anderson's recent performance in the second Test was one of the greatest I've ever seen from an England cricketer .\nHowever, Alastair Cook's played an even bigger role in England's success .\nCook's battling and captaincy qualities were clear to see throughout .\nElsewhere, England will have a very good player back on their hands if Jonathan Trott can regain his old calmness going into the third test .",

Steven Sloan, joined by friends Michael Niccum and Eugene Dight were on an aluminium rowboat when the encounter occurred off the west coast of Anderson Island, Washington. Filming from the boat, Steven captured the orcas swimming from afar \u2013 two of them can be seen jumping from the water. At a safe distance: The group cheer in excitment as Steven captures two orcas swimming and jumping from the water . The group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat. According to Steven, the group believe that the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the pod to them, as its distinctive sound disturbed the whales. Commenting on their approach, one of the group can be heard saying: \u2018They\u2019re probably coming to check us out.\u2019 The group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas . One of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright . Before later adding: \u2018That is like 50 yards from us,\u2019 as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat. After suggesting that it might be a good idea to start rowing away, one of the group begins panicking and shouts: \u2018Guys we need to get out of here, it\u2019s coming right at us.\u2019 He then states: \u2018We need to sit down in the boat. We need to get out of here. It is probably under us. This is really dangerous, I\u2019m scared.\u2019 'We need to get out of here':The group panic as a killer whales approach their aluminium boat . The killer whales are videoed circling and swimming dangerously close to  the tiny boat . Suddenly an orca emerges from the water right beside the boat and the panicked member of the group screams in shock. Meanwhile the killer whales begin circling and swimming dangerously close to and underneath the tiny boat. Slightly less shocked now that the whale has made a relatively tame introduction, the group laugh nervously and begin heading back to shore. The group jokingly plead with the killer whales as the marine mammals continue to swim around the boat . The video maker captures a killer whale swimming underneath the aluminium boat in Washington . On the way back they jokingly plead with the orcas, and one of them says: \u2018Please don\u2019t attack us.\u2019 Referring to the incident on the original upload of the video, Steven wrote: \u2018Feel free to laugh at how I respond to a scary situation like this and enjoy the beautiful orcas at the beautiful Anderson Island.\u2019",

        "article": "Mila Kunis is to counter-sue the woman who is suing her for stealing her chicken. The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to\u00a0Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: Kunis deduces it must be 'just coincidence' Karo is trying to launch a music career just as she threatens with the lawsuit .",

        "article": "Boston (CNN)Sending Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to prison for the rest of his life would bring years of punishment and rob him of martyrdom, jurors were told Monday. \"We have seen more pain and more horror and more grief in this courtroom than any of you would have thought possible,\" attorney David Bruck said as Tsarnaev's defense team began what could be a two-week campaign to avoid the death penalty. \"No punishment could ever be equal to the terrible effects of this crime on the survivors and the victims' families,\" he said. \"There is no evening of the scales. There is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done. All we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\" Bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole. \"We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\" Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado, Bruck said: . \"This is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but aren't anymore. ... He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight, like the death penalty brings. \"No interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from Jahar on the Internet. No nothing. \"No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did. \"The evidence will show that if you sentence Jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you'll both punish him and protect society.\" Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell, 29; Lingzi Lu, 23; Martin Richard, 8; and Sean Collier, 26. In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison, jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors, such as his relative youth, mental health and family background, and whether or not he is remorseful. He has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead. Last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant, where Richard and Lu died. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 26, died in a gunbattle with Watertown, Massachusetts, police three days after the bombings. Clarke's colleague, Bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"The man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left. \"He was 19, nearly 20. But he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. And an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. What each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\" Bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing Tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point. \"I could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, Bruck said. \"It turned out that shocking gesture wasn't quite as advertised. \"What did he mean? It meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old.\" Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15, 2013, bombings. Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed. Under federal law, the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.",

        "article": "Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital for an unspecified medical emergency after a judge ruled on Thursday that he\u00a0will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges. The former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says Knight was transported to a hospital from the downtown courthouse. She says no further details could be released. Scroll down for video . 'Suge' Knight, pictured above on April 8, will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges following a hit-and-run, an LA judge said on Thursday . The parents of Suge Knight (pictured left) and his girlfriend (right) comfort each other outside the Los Angeles courthouse after learning on Thursday that he will stand trial for murder . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling on Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle 'Bone' Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand in Los Angeles county. The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million.\u00a0On Thursday morning, Knight walked out of court after the hearing. A message sent to Knight\u2019s attorney Matt Fletcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Sloan told detectives that he attacked Knight but testified on Monday that he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a 'snitch'. Prosecutors played Sloan's statement to police, which offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on January 29 that led up to the deadly encounter. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55. Suge Knight's parents seen leaving the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday after a judge ruled that their son will stand trial for murder and attempted murder . Victim Terry Carter's eldest daughter seen leaving court with attorney Carl Douglas after the announcement that Marion Suge Knight will stand trial for murder and attempted murder on Thursday . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, said his client was ambushed and was trying to escape Sloan's attack when he ran over the men. Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses. 'I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,' Sloan testified, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed. Prosecutors granted Sloan, a former gang member who's known Knight for decades, limited immunity after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film 'Straight Outta Compton,' said he was trying to forget details of the crash, in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury. 'Every day, I try to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' Sloan's memory troubles prompted the judge to comment on his testimony: 'I find that this witness is being deceptive.' The judge also heard from the lead detective investigating the case and watched security camera footage of the crash. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - \u00a0at one hearing in March, a medical condition sent him to the hospital . The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot but shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan, then hitting him again and running over Carter while fleeing the scene. Fletcher, Knight's attorney, pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the crash. Sloan said he was mad but disputed that he told detectives he was enraged. Fletcher also painted Sloan as the aggressor, saying Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner. You agree?' 'Yes,' Sloan said. Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the case. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. Knight pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation in an assault on two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. The rap figure was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car near the Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Prosecutors only had to present a fraction of their evidence against Knight during the preliminary hearing that began on Monday. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained earlier this month when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court. 'No snitch': Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 45, (left, file photo) told the court that he 'will not be used to send Suge Knight  to prison'. Knight is accused of murdering Terry Carter, 55, (right) and trying to murder Sloan, whom he left with broken bones and other injuries .",

In the video, released by the Los Angeles Police Department, two men and one woman can be seen entering a San Fernando Valley home in the mid-afternoon. The burglars get into the house through the kitchen, peeking and even tip-toeing around as they walk through the living room of the empty home and disappear into what seems to be a hallway. Say cheese! This young burglar stared right into a security camera and he and two pals robbed a home in Los Angeles - making off with a large safe and multiple guns . A California homeowner's surveillance video captured footage of three burglars, two men and one woman, who broke into their Los Angeles home mid-afternoon . Then one suspect returns. He checks the kitchen again before moving into the living room. That's when he stares directly into the surveillance camera and realizes he's being filmed. The boy immediately ducks and then hits the camera over, but not before it was able to capture a visual of his face. The LAPD released the video on its Facebook page with the hope that it would help identify the burglars, who escaped with another man not seen in the surveillance footage, from the March 2 incident. A 5ft safe and a number of firearms were stolen from the home, according to KTLA 5. Police did not specify the number or types of guns that were taken.

Officials ordered 250,000 birds to be slaughtered in Telangana\u00a0after cases of the H5N1 virus were identified, which can be deadly in humans. The virus caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry after it spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006. Culled: About 250,000 birds infected with the H5N1 virus are slaughtered in Telangana, India . Since then, India has regularly reported cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds. Veterinary staff from the local government's animal husbandry department carried out the cull - which included destroying hundreds of thousands of infected eggs - at Thorrur village in the Ranga Reddy district. Birds present in poultry farms were slaughtered while the eggs, including those stored in warehouses, were dumped in a pit. Destroyed: Thousands of infected eggs were dumped in a pit and buried following an outbreak of bird flu . Clean up: Authorities ordered the destruction of birds and eggs at farms across\u00a0Telangana in India following the latest bird flu outbreak . Bird feed stock was burned and the sites were all thoroughly disinfected in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu since 2006. Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively rare and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with infected birds. But fears remain the aviation flu could combine with a human strain to produce a mutation that is more dangerous and difficult to control. In February, three people were tested for bird flu and 10,000 chickens slaughtered in Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis. More than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the Italian crisis.",

        "article": "A population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the United States to freely roam the plains of Alaska for the first time in over a century. The moment was captured on video and shows Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton leading 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile. The land mammals were freed from a temporary pen, where they had been kept for just over a week during the transition, and followed Mr Seaton to their new home. They journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko, which is surrounded by the Yukon River. Wood bison are North America\u2019s largest land mammal, but the native Alaskan species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago. In the video the animals can be seen chasing after the snowmobile in a herd from within side a fenced track. Wood bison were imported from Canada to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in 2008 but restoration of the threatened species was delayed. The population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the United States for first time in over a century . Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton lead 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile . Landowners didn't want their property listed as critical habitat with additional federal oversight. The state and federal governments agreed to consider the Alaska wood bison as 'experimental' without the usual Endangered Species Act requirements. With the help of corporate and non-profit sponsors, the department moved 50 cows and 50 juveniles aged two or less to the village. But the task was not without its risks as the large mammals were vulnerable to broken limbs, or if they fell, trampling. Two wood bison bulls photographed grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in Portage, Alaska . Wood bison cows resting and grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center  in Portage, Alaska . Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Cathie Harms, said: \u2018When you're transporting a very large, not completely domesticated animal, you always have to worry about injuries.\u2019 To minimize jostling in the cargo plane the juveniles were transported in small groups within special bison boxes. Cows had individual pens, which provided them with enough room to stand for the one-hour drive from the conservation centre to Anchorage and a one-hour flight to the village. Once arrived, the bison moved on their own from the boxes to the snow-covered fields in a fenced area outside Shageluk. The land mammals chased after the snowmobile, which dropped alfalfa cubes, in a herd from within side a fenced track . The wood bison journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko .

        "article": "(CNN)It didn't seem like a fair fight. On one side were hulking football players and pro wrestlers, competing as teams of two to eat as many pounds of steak as they could, combined, in one hour. On another was a lone 124-pound mother of four. And sure enough, in the end, Sunday's contest at Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, Texas, wasn't even close. Molly Schuyler scarfed down three 72-ounce steaks, three baked potatoes, three side salads, three rolls and three shrimp cocktails -- far outpacing her heftier rivals. That's more than 13 pounds of steak, not counting the sides. And she did it all in 20 minutes, setting a record in the process. \"We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time,\" Bobby Lee, who co-owns the Big Texan, told CNN affiliate KVII. \"So this is a first for us, and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal.\" In fairness, Schuyler isn't your typical 124-pound person. The Nebraska native, 35, is a professional on the competitive-eating circuit and once gobbled 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes. Wearing shades and a black hoodie, Schuyler beat four other teams on Sunday, including pairs of football players and pro wrestlers and two married competitive eaters. She also broke her own Big Texan record of two 72-ounce steaks and sides, set last year, when she bested previous record-holder Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut. The landmark Big Texan restaurant offers its \"72-ounce Challenge\" daily to anyone who can eat the massive steak, plus fixings, in under an hour. Those who can't do so must pay $72 for the meal. Schuyler, who now lives in Sacramento, California, won $5,000 for her efforts. Her feat will be submitted to Guinness World Records. But mostly, she just seemed pleased to enjoy a hearty meal on the house. \"It's free, so I'm pretty happy about that,\" she told KVII. \"Otherwise it would have cost me about 300 bucks.\"",

'Hi, are you having fun?' his mother asks at one point, to which Marcus replies with a loud squeal. He then stops to look at the camera before starting his bouncing stunt again. After a few gentle rocks, he's soon going at full speed with his arms waving in the air. Adding to the performance, he trills his lips at the same time. At the one-minute-30-second mark, Marcus shows no sign of slowing down. Four years on, videos show that the youngster has swapped his passion for bouncing with playing the guitar. With so much energy though, it's likely he'll be strumming some some rock n' roll beats instead of classical sounds.

        "article": "David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy. The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video . David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy . He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real \u2013 a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business\u2026 now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late . London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader . Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost \u00a3600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose. How can we lose when so much is at stake and when we have such a strong hand?'",

Calcium formations on \u2018Altamura Man\u2019, a skeleton found in a cave in 1993, suggest he was 128,000 to 187,000 years old. Now researchers plan to sequence his DNA to see if they can reveal new details about the evolution of our ancient ancestors. Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. The current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck. Altamura is a city of Apulia, in southern Italy.\u00a0It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck . Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. Pictured is\u00a0\u2018Altamura Man's\u2019 skull from different angles . Scientists assume he starved to death, or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life. Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .",

'We all need to live side-by-side in harmony and not hunt our fellow citizens who live in the forest.' In one shot, the bear wraps his paws around one of the models while she is lying in the snow wearing a swimming costume.

Stephen, the 18-year-old, 2.2metre tall bear, was rescued by his owner Yuriy Panteleenko, who found him barely alive in the hands of hunters. He negotiated the three-month-old bear's release, but soon discovered his mother had either abandoned him or been slaughtered and he was too weak. Instead Mr Panteleenko took him in and hand-raised him like a parent. But after being hand reared, Stephen was unable to reintegrate back into the wild. The professional circus trainer eventually trained Stephan to become a movie star - and the animal has since appeared in a host of Russian blockbusters including, Tsar.

        "article": "The 73-year-old reserve deputy who mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of a Taser and shot dead a fleeing suspect says the mix-up could have happened to anyone. Robert Bates, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, \"I don't understand how this can happen\". You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. He also dismissed recent reports in the Tulsa World that he had not completed the proper hours of training, saying it is 'absolutely the truth' that he had paperwork to show he had completed it. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World\u00a0claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted. See below for video .",

        "article": "Another day, another baton change, another away defeat for Middlesbrough. Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they\u2019d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale \u2013 they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship\u2019s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used:\u00a0Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Tiendalli (Kalas 63), Woodgate, Amorebieta, Friend; Leadbitter, Clayton (Forshaw 84); Adomah, Tomlin (Kike 62), Reach; Bamford. Subs not used:\u00a0Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee:\u00a0Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: \u2018The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. \u2018The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don\u2019t want to forget our position is amazing.\u2019 True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford\u2019s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, \u2018the difference\u2019. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney\u2019s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. \u2018He\u2019s a Premier League player,\u2019 said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. \u2018It\u2019s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.\u2019 Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter\u2019s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker\u2019s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: \u2018I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.\u2019 Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford .

A Kingston police spokesman said: \u2018The man was initially requested to delete the photos, however after the officer clarified the Metropolitan Police Service\u2019s approach towards photography of police officers and vehicles with his supervisors, he realised the man was allowed to keep them. \u2018The police vehicles parked on the bus stand are part of the Met\u2019s Safer Transport Command and have been given permission by the local authority to park there.\u2019 Mr Power said: \u2018I appreciate that police cars need to stop wherever they can for operational matters, but these vehicles are always there. It\u2019s one rule for them and one rule for us, I suppose.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN)The night before her daughter's first triathlon, Kate Parker could tell the child was nervous. Ella and her younger sister, Alice, are athletic, loud, curious, wild-haired kids. They grew up watching their mother compete in races and Ella had asked to sign up for her own. Still, as they laid out everything she'd need the next day, Parker, a photographer, could tell she was afraid. \"Why don't we get a picture?\" Parker asked Ella, now 9. \"Show me your strongest face, show me your bravest face, even if you don't feel that way right now.\" As she pulled the image up on her screen, she got chills from her daughter's direct stare. She looked, Parker said, like \"a little badass.\" \"You're going to be totally fine,\" Parker showed her. \"Look at how tough you are.\" The next day, Ella participated in her race, and loved it. Looking back, \"I wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it, sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear, \" said Parker, who lives near Atlanta. \"As a mom, I really wanted to get a good picture of it, too.\" The photo is one of Parker's favorites from her series, \"Strong is the New Pretty.\" It covers the last two years, but evolved from Parker's early days behind a camera, when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition. It seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows, forced smiles and Photoshop-smooth skin. Hers didn't. \"I didn't want to shoot pictures like that. I didn't want girls to think they had to look like that,\" said Parker, whose daughters are now 6 and 9. \"Whoever they were, however they were, was worthy of an image. Whatever they were was good enough.\" So, she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled, muddy, screaming, laughing, jumping in the pool, collecting worms in the creek, barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles. \"I want to capture them before they lose that sense of 'I'm so awesome.' I wanted them to keep that as long as they could,\" Parker said. \"I started to shoot with that in mind, but it was already there.\" The girls pose for an occasional portrait, but most are kid-inspired moments, shaped by childish wonderment and energy. As parents, Parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside, make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair, Parker said. Now, the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own. \"They're just being themselves, and I'm just recording it,\" Parker said. Responses to the images are mostly positive, Parker said, but there's the occasional complaint that she's showing just one type of girl. It's true, Parker said: They're the ones she's raising, the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7. She hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children's lives. More important, she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be. Parker's own kids still surprise her. \"Alice is a beautiful singer. When I hear her sing, it makes me cry,\" Parker said. \"Ella has this amazing, kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win. It's something that I did not teach her. \"Whatever it is, it's OK.\"",

        "article": "It has long been a complaint that all politicians are the same. Now the Green party has set it to music, with a new election advert featuring David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage forming a bizarre pro-austerity boyband. The video, complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change, is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration. The video begins with 'David Cameron' playing a white grand piano, with 'Ed Miliband' looking on . It sees Mr Cameron entering a polling booth and telling voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys' The advert is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration . The song, Change The Tune, features comedians playing the four party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition. According to the Green party, the quartet 'sing in harmony about their shared love of austerity and fondness for fracking'. It sees Mr Cameron tell voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys'. The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition.' It also takes a swipe at the background of leading politicians, with the verse: 'The choice between us couldn't be clearer, Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya, Whether it's Trident or High Speed Two, The lesser of four evils is up to you.' Notably the video, which last 3minutes, 40 seconds, does not feature Green leader Natalie Bennett at all. With the party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition, the video is complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change . Dancing around a large pound sign, the four leaders are shown singing: 'Austerity! Austerity! Austerity!' Green party leader Natatlie Bennett said she wanted to show how\u00a0the Establishment parties 'have been singing from the same hymn sheet' The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition' She has suffered a series of difficult media appearances in recent weeks, including claiming people who join ISIS should not be criminalised, struggling to make her housing sums add up and admitting it could take decades to implement her 'citizen's income'. Despite the gaffes, the Green party has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in the last year and now boasts more members than both the Lib Dems and Ukip. Unveiling the new advert, Ms Bennett said: 'For many years the Establishment parties have been singing from the same hymn sheet. 'The Westminster consensus \u2013 which sees all other parties sign up to austerity economics, privatisation of our public services and inaction on climate change \u2013 is coming to an end. The Green Party is offering a real alternative to business-as-usual politics. 'We want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means bringing in a Living Wage of \u00a310 an hour by 2020 and fair taxes on rich individuals and Britain's biggest corporations. 'Voting Green on May 7th is a chance for people to play their part in breaking open the political harmony of the Establishment parties.'",

        "article": "It seems that 2014 was a very, very good year to be Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year. This amount, thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week, shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and his running of networks like OWN, makes him one of the highest paid television executives. Scroll down for video . David Zaslav (above) was compensated $156.1million for his role as CEO of Discovery Communications it was revealed on Friday . This thanks to\u00a0shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (left) and his running of networks like Oprah Winfrey's OWN (right) Discovery has also done well thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week . Variety reports that a large portion of that money comes from stocks, with Zaslav receiving $144million in awards for his six-year contract. 1.Sumner Redstone\u00a0(CBS, Viacom) - $93.4m . 2.Les Moonves\u00a0(CBS) - $66.9m . 3.Philippe Dauman\u00a0(Viacom) - $37.2m . 4.Bob Iger\u00a0(Disney) - $34.3m . 5.David Zaslav (Discovery) - $33.3m . 6.Jeffrey Bewkes\u00a0(Time Warner) - $32.5m . 7.Brian Roberts\u00a0(Comcast) - $31.4m . 8.Stephen Burke\u00a0(NBC) - $31.1m . 9.Chris Albrecht\u00a0(Starz) - $30.5m . 10.Thomas Dooley (Viacom) - $29.1m . It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards. The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today. As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million. This amount is far, far greater than the two television executives who made the most last year, Sumer Redstone and Les Moonves. Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million. 'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states. 'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made . Zaslav is also likely to become the biggest shareholder at Discovery under this new contract is he buys the shares of television mogul\u00a0John Malone who also holds a sizable stake in the company. He will have right of first refusal to purchase Malone's stocks should he sell. The contract will expire in 2019.",

        "article": "A 25-year-old man left brain damaged as a baby after a blunder by doctors has today won his 23-year battle for \u00a37.3 million compensation. The young man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now relies on 24-hour care. He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989, but was readmitted three months later, suffering a serious brain haemorrhage. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born. A 25-year-old man was left brain damaged as a baby after doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection to help the blood clot and prevent internal bleeding. He now requires 24-hour care and will do for the rest of his life. (File picture) The booster is given to newborn babies to reduce their risk of blood clots. The Secretary of State for Health admitted liability, accepting the\u00a0failure to give the man vitamin K breached their duty of care. At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the \u00a37.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority. It awards the man a lump sum of \u00a32,345,000, as well as annual payments of \u00a3181,000, rising to \u00a3192,000 - making a total of \u00a37,385,000. Vitamin K helps the blood to clot, and as a result can prevent excessive internal bleeding. In the UK new parents are asked if they would like their newborn to recieve the supplement. Babies are born with low levels of the vitamin, but the amount is normally enough to prevent problems. Some babies are at greater risk, and are more likely to suffer haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Because it can be difficult to ascertain which babies are at heightened risk, the Department of Health recommends all babies receive the supplement soon after birth. Though rare, HDN is a very serious disease. Half of all babies with HDN suffer a haemorrhage into their brain, often resulting in brain damage. Babies at higher risk of HDN include: . Source: NCT . Judge Yelton said the man should not be named because he was a 'vulnerable person'. But he said he was 'entirely satisfied' the settlement was in his best interests. He said he was 'very pleased' for the young man and his family. The brain damage the now 25-year-old suffered has resulted in significant cognitive and physical problems, including a weakness on his left hand side, and reduced hearing. He also lacks the capacity to manage his own affairs, and needs round the clock care. His family welcomed the settlement, adding it will allow for specialist support, specially adapted accommodation and 24-hour care. His solicitor Arani Yogadeva of Irwin Mitchell said: 'Vitamin K injections are offered to parents as a measure to boost their newborn baby's anti-clotting processes shortly after birth and reduce the risks of them suffering excessive bleeding caused by a deficiently in the vitamin. 'In this case, midwives and doctors chose not to provide him with the relevant dose without advising his mother about the vitamin and the importance of it - a decision which has had serious repercussions. 'We are delighted to have helped the family secure vital financial support, along with an admission of liability. 'It will ensure he gets the lifelong care he requires and also urge hospitals to ensure that guidance is following in relation to the issue of vitamin K.' At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the \u00a37.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority following a 23-year battle .",

        "article": "New pictures have emerged of Louis Tomlinson's wild night of partying with a group of five girls. The One Direction star was seen barefoot and sat on the edge of a sofa during a stay at London's Soho Hotel on Wednesday night, in which he appeared to be rolling a joint while sat next to a box filled with a suspicious substance. And now, a series of newly-released Snapchat shots of the raucous\u00a0gathering have emerged, appearing to show the 23-year-old singer in his hotel room in the company of friends in the small hours of Thursday morning. Scroll down for video . Up all night: Louis Tomlinson is clearly visible in previously unseen pictures from his wild night out with five girls, taken before he was pictured rolling a 'suspicious cigarette' in his hotel room in London . Jokes: The Snapchat video shows Louis back in his room at the Soho Hotel in London with his female friends, as one of them jokes that they aren't sure which member of One Direction he is . One social media snap captioned with the time showed the wild party going on until at least 5.48am. Another image shows newly-single Louis partying at the nightclub beforehand in the company of a green-haired young lady holding up a cigarette, with the caption 'love' over the image. Shots taken from a Snapchat video show the back of Louis within the hotel room while a person - whose face is obscured - lays on the couch in front of him. Across the image reads the joke caption: 'apparently hes one direction lol? Harry? Dunn', hinting that the girls pretending to be unaware which member of the globally-revered group he was. Change of clothing: Although Louis was seen returning to the Soho Hotel in the same Brooklyn-emblazoned jumper that he wore in the 'spliff' picture, he seemed to have removed the sweater for a time . Crowd in: Louis returned to the Soho Hotel after leaving Cirque Le Soir at 4am with his female friends, in the same t-shirt he was seen wearing in the Snapchat images . Perhaps taken from the very same video, the young singer is also seen playing the 'air guitar', according to the written comment. Louis - who split from his long-term love Eleanor Calder weeks ago - was photographed leaving the Soho Hotel after a long night of partying with his pals in the city on Thursday, with a rather sheepish look on his face. He was still clad in the very same outfit he had worn during his raucous night out, which saw him leave Soho's Cirque Le Soir nightclub at 4am and head back to his hotel room to continue the party. After the party: Louis returned to his hotel in London's Soho on Thursday, apparently after the pictures of him with the roll up were taken - he is wearing the very same Brooklyn sweater as in the images . That's the shirt! As Louis arrived back at his Soho hotel at around 4.30am on Thursday morning, he was wearing the very same white tee as in the Snapchat images . Raucous: The 1D star seemed in fantastic spirits as he returned with his female friends and a man who appeared to be a member of his security team . Clinging on: A pretty brunette held onto the star's arm as they entered the hotel . Although Louis was seen wearing the same white 'Brooklyn' jumper when he was pictured with the suspicious 'cigarette', the garment he was seen walking around the hotel in the following day, the Snapchat images show him to be wearing a t-shirt. And it's the very same white top he wore on his return to the hotel after leaving the club, when he was seen getting out of a taxi filled with his gaggle of female friends. The party pals stepped out of the car and made their way as a group into the hotel, seemingly to carry on the atmosphere. Tired? Since spitting from his long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder in March, Louis has enjoyed several nights out with mystery females . Popular location: Two of the young ladies who spent the evening celebrating with Louis were later seen leaving the Soho Hotel . The original picture showed Louis perching on the edge of the sofa in the hotel room, presumably after their all-night celebration. The image, which shows the One Direction star poised with the suspicious roll-up and sitting next to a plastic tub containing a dry, green weed-like substance and rolling paper, was taken in the early hours of Thursday morning. That same day he was photographed returning to his London hotel in a disheveled state clutching a glass of water. The singer has recently been letting his hair down and enjoying his newly-single status, after breaking up from his girlfriend of four years, Eleanor Calder, in March. In the original picture, apparently taken in London  during this two-day party session, Tomlinson appears to be smiling as he balances a magazine on his lap, smiling distractedly at a girl by his side as he prepares the suspicious cigarette. It is the latest blow to the boy band just one month after Zayn Malik announced his decision to quit the group. 'Happy days': What Louis Tomlinson was heard saying as Zayn Malik smoked what appeared to be marijuana as the band was ferried to a stadium in Lima, the capital of Peru, for a concert . Shortly before his announcement it had emerged that Zayn, 22, and Louis were being forced to post bonds worth close to $12,000 to be allowed into the Philippines where they were due to play a concert in Manila. The money was to be forfeited if either were caught using illegal drugs while there. And the new picture comes in the wake of a video filmed last April where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a joint during the Latin American Leg of their 2014 stadium tour. The explosive video obtained by Daily Mail Online last May sent shock waves through One Direction\u2019s young fan base. Still partying: Louis headed for a night on the town in London on Thursday . Past love: Louis ended his four-year relationship with Eleanor Calder back in March . Louis could be heard narrating from behind the camera as he filmed his bandmate on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. At one point he announced: \u2018So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!\u2019 Fellow band members Harry Styles, Liam Payn and Niall Horan were not present as, during the 15 minute journey in a smoke filled SUV, Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joked with each other and three members of their crew who are travelling with them. A member of the team asked about the filming: \u2018Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?\u2019 Louis replied: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what it is about.\u2019 Current line-up: The four-member version of One Direction performs in South Africa last month after the departure of Zayn Malik to pursue a solo career . The way they were: Clean-cut One Direction - from left Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne . Adopting a faux serious tone as he focused on Zayn who sat beside him wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt, Louis said: \u2018Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. \u2018One very, very important factor of Zayn\u2019s warm up of course is Mary J herself. IN fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.\u2019 The band faced heavy criticism after the video leak with thousands of fans dumping tickets to their shows. Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying, \u2018I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.\u2019 He added: \u2018We are only in our 20s and we all do stupid things at this age.\u2019 MailOnline has approached the band's spokesperson for comment.",

Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to manoeuvre herself over the edge of her crib and a \u2018safety ridge\u2019 cut off the oxygen to her brain. West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield yesterday issued a report expressing concern over the Bednest Bedside cot, which was endorsed by the charity National Children\u2019s Trust, saying urgent action must be taken to prevent future deaths. Tragic: Seven-week-old Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to move over the edge of her adjustable cot and a 'safety' ridge cut off oxygen supply to her brain, West Sussex Coroner's Court heard . Concerns: The webpage of the luxury cot which has been linked with her death. A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangled . Grace\u2019s mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot \u2013 which is designed to be placed next to a parent\u2019s bed \u2013 has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high. Mrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot. The provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace\u2019s windpipe. In her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: \u2018In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. 'If the cot\u2019s side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.\u2019 Grace\u2019s father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: \u2018There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. Grace's parents told the inquest\u00a0'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie' \u2018She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.\u2019 The National Children\u2019s Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: \u2018This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time. \u2018We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.\u2019 Bednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from \u00a3249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: \u2018We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down. \u2018Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.\u2019 A spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: \u2018We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace\u2019s parents. \u2018We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest\u2019s design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses. \u2018It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot \u201cdangerous\u201d and asked for it to be withdrawn. \u2018The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace\u2019s crib. \u2018We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.\u2019",

        "article": "More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida - only to find they would have to spend a year taking online classes. The 3,118 unidentified applicants were presumably delighted when they were accepted as freshmen by the university in Gainesville for the fall after sending in applications for traditional first-year slots. But after reading their congratulations notices, they apparently realized they would need to agree to spend their entire first year taking classes on the Internet in order to attend the public college. The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE) - which started in 2015 and aims to\u00a0accommodate a higher number of students,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported. New program: More than 3,000 students are facing an unexpected decision after they received acceptance notices from the University of Florida (pictured) - only to find they would have to take online classes for a year . The students who were accepted to the university - on the basis they agreed to undertake online classes for a year - had not applied to the program, which will likely help expand enrollment in the university's new\u00a0$15million online undergraduate program, created by state legislators in 2013. They were also in addition to the estimated 12,000 students offered traditional freshman slots. Steve Orlando, senior director of UF's media relations, told the newspaper the move 'allows us to offer admission to additional qualified applicants with academic potential and demonstrated success'. Joe Glover, who has been the university's Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs since July 2008, added: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country. 'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations.' On its website, UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it.' It adds it 'offers an excellent academic experience, combining online and campus-based learning'. New iniatitive: The classes are part of a new program - the Pathway to Campus Enrollment (PaCE, pictured) - which started in 2015 and aims to accommodate a higher number of students at the flagship university . Extending space: On its website , UF says that PaCE helps deal with the 'limited space of campus' and gives students 'the chance to start [their] degree online and then transition to campus in order to complete it' It tells students: 'Because of limitations to our freshman enrollment on UF's residential campus, we are unable to accommodate every capable student who applies to the university. 'However, because of your demonstrated potential, we are offering you a pathway to UF's residential campus different from our traditional transfer program.' With legislators keen to expand online learning at Florida universities, UF's online graduate program became available to students in 2014, with a huge $15million assigned to start-up and initial costs. But PaCE 'didn\u2019t fully exist' last fall for the 2016 admissions season, Mr Glover told the newspaper, describing the initiative as 'an experiment' that some of the 3,118 students may not wish to accept. Provost: Joe Glover (pictured), the university's Provost, said: 'The market for freshman is by no means clear anywhere in the country.'We are trying different things to identify that market. That is one of the motivations' He admitted that many parents were surprised to find their children had been accepted to UF on the condition they took online classes - and had bombarded him with calls asking questions about it. On its website, UF states that to be achieve a degree through the PaCE program, students must be willing to 'enroll for at least two semesters and a minimum of 15 credits through UF Online'. It adds: 'After earning a total of 60 credits and meeting program requirements, students may submit a transition form to move from online learning to a guaranteed place on the UF residential campus.' The program offers 60 majors in seven colleges, including psychology and telecommunication. Students in PaCE  receive a 25 per cent tuition discount, the website says. They will also not have to pay some of the fees required for residential students.",

The 29-year-old American - the most decorated Olympian in history with 22 medals, 18 of them golds - will compete at the Arena Pro Swim Series event in Mesa, Arizona, from April 15-18. Phelps was suspended by USA swimming following his drink-driving arrest in September when police caught him travelling at 84mph in a 45mph zone in Baltimore, Maryland. Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic medals, 18 golds, but was banned from swimming in September . Having served his six month suspension the American will return to the pool in Arizona next week . 'My suspension is finally up! Time to get back in the pool and race again! Looking forward to #mesa !!,' Phelps wrote on his official Twitter account. The Arizona meeting is the same one at which Phelps returned to last year after a 20-month retirement from competitive swimming. Phelps is still serving the 18 months of probation he received from a Baltimore District Court judge after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in December. The drink-driving arrest was Phelps' second in 10 years, and he responded by seeking treatment for alcohol abuse at an in-patient centre in Arizona. Phelps has been training in Baltimore and performed will in an exhibition race last month . Phelps has since returned to Baltimore where he has been training with long-time coach Bob Bowman and he swam impressively in a March exhibition race. As part of his punishment from USA Swimming, Phelps was also removed from the US team for the FINA World Championships to be held in Russia this summer. But USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus said last month there was a chance Phelps could be restored to the team ahead of what would be his fourth Olympic Games at Rio in 2016.",

She was first diagnosed with the condition in 2013 where\u00a0she was initially given daily medication to help relieve the pain. But on Thursday, amazing photographs were captured of the\u00a0primate's thorough health examination by surgeons. Although is not unusual for middle-aged orangutans to have arthritis, doctors had to anaesthetise Suma in order to check how her condition has progressed over the past two years. Suma was treated by orthopaedic surgeon and associate professor Marino Pirpiris, who usually treats humans, and senior vet Dr Helen McCracken. X-rays were taken in areas where the orangutan has arthritis, her hips and ankles, as Dr Pirpiris then gave the ape a steroid injection which will reduce her pain for months and perhaps even years. Doctors were also able to give Suma a full check up, including her ears, teeth, and eyes, and also took urine and blood samples.

        "article": "(CNN)Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com. But she's now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star's, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. \"For one week, walk in someone else's shoes,\" Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City's website. \"By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions.\" The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is an attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week, which translates to $1.38 per meal, according to the site. The effort is in response to recent cuts to food stamps. \"Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,\" the site explains. Organizers hope the challenge will raise public awareness of the struggles for families to afford food while on food stamps.",

        "article": "FC United of Manchester, the club set up in protest at the Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United, are now two promotions away from the Football League. On an emotional night in front of 3,588 noisy fans the Rebels, soon to celebrate their 10th anniversary, sealed the fourth promotion of their short history with this nervy win over Stourbridge saw them crowned Evo-Stik Northern Premier champions. Hundreds of ecstatic supporters invaded the pitch at the final whistle as the breakaway outfit secured elevation to the sixth tier after the heartbreak of no less than four play-off defeats. VIDEO Scroll down to see pitch invasion as FC United of Manchester win Evo-Stik North title . FC United of Manchester players celebrate securing promotion following a 1-0 win over Stourbidge . The club's fourth promotion in their short history sees them come within two more of the Football League . FC will move to a new 5,000 capacity stadium of their own in May, ending a nomadic existence spent entirely on the road. And it was the Tameside Stadium, home of neighbours Curzon Ashton, that hosted the latest chapter in an already significant history. In a tense first-half winger Craig Lindfield, a building estimator, headed against the bar as the home side struggled to break down a resolute Stourbridge defence. And it appeared not to be their night when sub Shelton Payne had a volley cleared off the line. But on 69 minutes student and full back Greg Daniels rose unmarked to head home the impressive Lindfield's cross and spark joyous scenes. It was the perfect finish from the former Macclesfield apprentice who was last week painting houses while on holiday from university. FC came into existence in 2005 when a group of United supporters, despairing of the debt-burdening Old Trafford takeover by the US-based family, decided enough was enough and created their own democratically-run club which kicked off at the bottom of the pyramid in North West Counties Division Two. From an initial meeting of a dozen at a curry house in the Rusholme district of Manchester they now boast more than 4,000 members, each of whom can claim to be an owners. Many of those were in fine voice here. Meanwhile, 30 miles down the road the Class of '92's Salford City celebrated promotion from the Evo-Stik Division One after title rivals Darlington 1883 could only draw 1-1 at Warrington Town. That result means the club, partly owned by United legends Phil and Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, were crowned champions in the high-profile quintet's first season at the helm. FC United manager Karl Marginson, who has been with the club since day one, believes 'anything is possible'. 'We've got a ground of our own,' he said, before a fan planted a kiss on his cheek. 'There's no reason why the league is not possible. We have to provide that for these supporters because they deserve it.' Marginson admits he did not know what to expect when he took over the fledgling club. 'I didn't know what to think,' he said. 'I didn't have a clue. But it's something I'm immensely proud of. It's something we have to hold onto.' Fans storm the pitch as the breakaway outfit celebrates a significant moment in their short history . When asked how he was going to celebrate Marginson added: 'I'm going to go to the Nag's Head if it's open when I get home.' General Manager Andy Walsh, who has also been with FC from the beginning, echoed his manager's comments. 'We will assess where we are going to go,' he said. 'We're not in a hurry and we've always been about building for the long-term. This is a football club that is built on the ambitions and beliefs of its supporters. 'I think the Football League is very possible. We have a manager and coaching staff that have shown they can challenge. I firmly believe they can manage and coach in the Football League and I hope it's with us.' Players carry a champions banner across the pitch as the club sets their sights on the big-time .",

        "article": "Follow your heart. That's the advice of Carl Jenkinson to Jack Grealish as the young Aston Villa star weighs up his international future. The West Ham defender, on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season, knows the predicament that faces the teenager torn between representing the Republic of Ireland or England. Jenkinson has experienced an identical international limbo before. Carl Jenkinson (left) says Jack Grealish should follow his heart when choosing Ireland or England . In 2012, a year after his big move from Charlton to the club he supported as a boy - Arsenal - the Essex-born full-back chose the Three Lions despite having played for Finland, the nation of his mother, at Under 18 and Under 21 level. It wasn't a decision Jenkinson took lightly, but it is one he firmly believes was the right decision. And now the Hammers star, 23, is advising boy-of-the-moment Grealish to also do what feels right for him. 'You\u2019ve got to follow your heart,' he said, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail. 'Follow where you feel like you belong and play for them. That would be my advice. 'That\u2019s what I did with the whole England-Finland situation. Finland were great to me when I was younger and I really enjoyed playing for them. The Aston Villa midfielder (centre right) has been an instant hit since breaking into the first team . 'It was a great experience at the time because I was playing against some of the best teams in the world. I was only in the Charlton reserves yet I was going off to be against all these different countries. It was fantastic for me and I really enjoyed it. 'But then it came to a crunch time where I had to pick and I had to ask myself: \"What do I feel \u2013 English or Finnish?\" The answer was English. I was born in England and I feel English, so that was the decision I made. 'I don\u2019t know Jack but my advice to him would be to follow what feels right. I\u2019m sure he will.' The clock is ticking for Grealish to make up his mind with Ireland boss Martin O'Neill understood to be keen to include him in his plans for the friendly against Roy Hodgson's England in Dublin this summer. The young winger played for Ireland at youth level but can still play for the England senior side . Jenkinson's superb form at West Ham this season has propelled him back into the international reckoning, meanwhile. An established fixture in the Under 21s set-up, the towering defender has earned calls to reclaim a place in the senior side. He is patient, however, despite his burning desire to add to the one cap he collected against Sweden almost three years ago when he came on as a substitute. Jenkinson harbours an ambition to lead his country to glory at this summer's Under 21s European Championships in Czech Republic, hoping to catch Hodgson's eye with next year's senior Euros not far away. Jenkinson was in the same predicament as Grealish when he had to choose between Finland and England . 'It is a massive opportunity for us,' he said. 'I think Roy Hodgson will be watching all the games and having a keen look at all the players. The senior Euros are a year after, so this will be a great chance for us to go and impress. 'When I speak to the lads, because I stay in touch with quite a few of them, everyone can\u2019t wait for it. 'It\u2019s a massive stage and something that we\u2019ve worked hard for. We\u2019re confident in ourselves. We feel that we can go there and really give it a good go. Roy Hodgson and his staff are believed to be fans of the young winger and want him to commit to England . 'We\u2019ve shown in the friendlies we\u2019ve played recently, like against Germany and Czech Republic, and we\u2019ve beaten them. We know we can do it. It\u2019s just about going there this summer and reproducing it. 'Obviously that\u2019s something in the past that we\u2019ve struggled with as a nation. But what a better time to change it and what a great thing it would be to go and win it.' For now, Jenkinson is focused on revitalising West Ham's season. Having started so impressively, reaching the top four at Christmas, the wheels have fallen off since the turn of the New Year. Jenkinson took part in a short film for Betway promoting #HammersAtTheArrers competition . In their past 11 Premier League games, the Hammers have won only once - and that was courtesy of a last minute winner at home to struggling Sunderland a month ago. The Hammers play QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday, their London rivals who are fighting for their lives at the foot of the table. Jenkinson expects it won't be a pretty affair but is confident Sam Allardyce's side can produce the goods to kickstart their charge for an eighth place finish. Manager Sam Allardyce also took part and he can be seen preparing to throw a dart . Joey O'Brien (from left), Winston Reid and Kevin Nolan laugh at their team-mates attempts . 'Team like QPR are probably even harder than playing teams who are in the top half at this stage. It\u2019s always the same towards the end of the season,' he said. 'They all pick up points because they\u2019re fighting for their lives at the end of the day \u2013 now we\u2019ve got to be aware of that and we need to be ready for that. 'It\u2019s going to be a proper scrap at the weekend. But we\u2019ll have to dig in if we want to get a result. Diego Poyet looks on as he attempts to score high in the Betway darts competition at the training ground . Jenkinson showed he's not just a bad footballer with some impressive dart scoring . 'I think Swansea are only four points ahead of us. They\u2019re in eighth. That would be a fantastic season if we could finish in eighth. 'Of course, you just want to finish in the top half. Anything below that would be a disappointment, especially considering how we started and I think everyone would agree with that. 'That eighth place is within reach.\u2019 Jenkinson's club future remains uncertain beyond this season but he appears to be happy at the Hammers. He took part in the club's darts competition, organised by the club's sponsors Betway, who also front the Premier League Darts, earlier this week - and you can watch the footage exclusively at\u00a0Sportsmail, here. Carl Jenkinson was speaking exclusively to MailOnline at the launch of Betway\u2019s #HammersAtTheArrers competition.

        "article": "The shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in corporation tax . Ed Balls yesterday opened the door to a tax raid on businesses, which critics warn would endanger the economic recovery. In a TV interview, the shadow chancellor refused to rule out a five-point rise in the main rate of corporation tax if Labour form the next government. He was also evasive about the 40p rate of income tax, into which millions of people have been dragged in recent years, saying he was unsure how quickly the threshold could be raised. Businesses are already concerned about Labour\u2019s stated plans not to cut corporation tax \u2013 paid by all large firms on their profits \u2013 as the Tories have vowed to if they win office. The main rate has been brought down under the Coalition from 28 per cent to 21 per cent. Asked if he would raise it, Mr Balls would only commit to keeping the main rate \u2018the lowest in the G7\u2019 group of countries. This leaves room to raise it up to 26.5 per cent, the level which is imposed in Canada. When it was suggested Labour could levy a rate of \u201824 per cent or 25 per cent\u2019, he did not rule it out, simply saying: \u2018We need to make sure we back businesses ... we will keep our rates low.\u2019 John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, warned last week that Labour\u2019s plans to intervene in markets, such as the energy market, and their \u2018signals on corporation tax are a cause for concern\u2019. He added that any rise in business taxes would \u2018undermine progress to make the whole tax system more competitive and send the wrong signal to firms of all sectors and sizes.\u2019 Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said the prospect of a business tax rise was a \u2018clear threat to working people\u2019s future economic security\u2019. He said: \u2018It\u2019s clear Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are leaving the door open to a damaging tax rise that risks costing jobs, risks costing investment and risks the economic recovery.\u2019 The Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think-tank has said raising corporation tax to 24 per cent gradually over the next five years would cost nearly 100,000 jobs by the end of the Parliament. Labour say by keeping corporation tax at the current rate, they can freeze business rates for 1.5million small firms. The main rate has been brought down from 28 per cent to 21 per cent under the coalition with the Tories vowing to lower corporation tax if they win the Election . Lloyds bank shares on offer for all . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year . Billions of pounds of shares in Lloyds bank will be sold off to the public at a discount rate within a year, David Cameron pledged yesterday. In the latest Tory attempt to revive the free market spirit of the 1980s, millions of small investors willing to spend \u00a3250 or more would be given priority access to shares still owned from the 2008 bank bailout. If the party wins the election, the sale would begin with a publicity drive similar to the \u2018Tell Sid\u2019 adverts that pushed the 1986 privatisation of British Gas. The plan would see up to \u00a34billion of Lloyds shares sold off at a discount of at least 5 per cent, with individual investors allowed to spend up to \u00a310,000. To counter any claims of a \u2018get rich quick\u2019 sell-off, buyers who keep the shares for a year would be rewarded with a loyalty bonus of one extra free share for every ten they hold. The sale would also recoup billions for the Exchequer to pay off some of the country\u2019s vast national debts. Yesterday the Prime Minister told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show this would be the first time there had been such an offer for individual investors. \u2018The taxpayer put billions into these banks and I want to get the money back,\u2019 he said. \u2018At the same time I think having people being able to own shares in a healthy, successful British bank is the sort of country we should be building.\u2019 Labour said the Tories had announced the sell-off policy seven times already \u2013 including before the last election. Lib Dem Danny Alexander said the idea had been rejected over the past five years \u2018because it\u2019s not been clear that we\u2019d be able to get the money back for the taxpayer\u2019. Lloyds was bailed out with \u00a320billion of taxpayers\u2019 money in 2008, leaving it 43 per cent state owned. The Government still owns \u00a312.5billion of shares, which were worth 78.7p each on Friday \u2013 compared to the 73.6p paid by Gordon Brown.",

        "article": "Lauren Crawley was given a new platinum implant . Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage\u00a0of stroke patients\u00a0who are affected\u00a0by facial\u00a0weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around \u00a33,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it .",

Dr Adam Cobb\u00a0was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr. If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography\u00a0after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island\u00a0after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

        "article": "(CNN)I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable . So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

        "article": "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has revealed he wants to bring in extra investment so the club can improve their Selhurst Park home. The Premier League side, who beat champions Manchester City 2-1 on Monday night, have been reportedly targeted for a takeover by Josh Harris - an American businessman who already owns the Philadelphia 76ers NBA team and the NHL outfit the New Jersey Devils. But Parish, who has been at Palace since he and his consortium saved the club from the brink of financial collapse in 2010, has since insisted he would remain involved and that investment rather than a complete takeover was his preferred option. Jason Puncheon scored a second-half free kick as Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 on Monday . Palace chairman Steve Parish says Alan Pardew will have funds to improve the squad in the summer . And now he has given his reasons for why he believes extra funds are required, insisting the current set-up would allow manager Alan Pardew to bring in the desired summer transfer targets but that other areas require more investment. 'The only reason for us to get money in is to improve the infrastructure,' he told BBC London. 'There is no rush and we are in a good place. If it happens, it happens. We've done well enough that I think we can fund the player things we need to do out of our own resources. 'We are long overdue some ground improvements. They are very costly. We need to make sure we get that done. If that means bringing in other people, and they are the right people, then we'll do it.' Parish would, however, like investment in the club to carry out improvements at Selhurst Park . The CPFC2010 consortium took over with the Eagles having only just survived relegation from the Championship and, in under five years, have overseen a return to top-flight football. They finished last season in 11th place, ensuring for the first time that their stay in the Premier League would last longer than a solitary campaign. Pardew has guided them to the same position after being appointed at the turn of the year and Monday night's victory over City all-but guarantees a third Premier League season. Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon had put Palace two goals up against the visitors, who could only find a consolation goal through Yaya Toure. Puncheon applauds the Manchester City supporters after a missile was thrown from the stands . Puncheon was also the target of a number of items thrown onto the pitch from the area housing Man City's supporters as he prepared to take a second-half corner. The Football Association are aware of the incident and will take appropriate action once they have their findings. It is not the first case of items being thrown onto the pitch at Selhurst Park this season, with Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini struck by a coin thrown as he celebrated a goal for his side. Just days later another item was thrown onto the playing area in the FA Cup meeting with Liverpool and Palace threatened to ban for life anyone found guilty of such acts.",

        "article": "Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend\u00a0Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a\u00a04-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage.\u00a0Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within\u00a0hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

        "article": "A grieving widow said she was frightened for the lives of herself and her family thanks to a 'nasty' neighbour who terrorised them for seven years. During the course of her harassment, Pauline Bruce's neighbour Yvonne Ireland Evans plagued her with silent calls, taunted her dying husband and attacked her son with secateurs. It's not the quiet and peaceful life pensioners Pauline and her late husband Tony expected when they moved to a static home on a community park for over-50s in\u00a0Ludlow, Shropshire, following Tony's retirement in 2002. Scroll down for video . Pauline and her son John were terrorised by their next door neighbour for seven years . Next-door-neighbour Yvonne went from being a friend, to a nuisance, and then a threat to their safety. She didn't even show any compassion when Tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011 and continued to torment Pauline and her son from a previous marriage, John, when they were grieving his death a year later. Pauline reveals on Channel 5's The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door how Yvonne turned on her after finding out she had struck up a friendship with another woman on the community park. Pauline explains: 'Our relationship started off very well, she was a very nice person, if she could help you in any way she would. She used to come in and have a cup of tea, we became friends.' But it all changed when Pauline started spending more time with another neighbour as they were working on a gardening project together. Yvonne started ignoring her and when Pauline asked why, she was told: 'because I had a new best friend, she didn't want to know us any more.' John holds up some\u00a0secateurs like the one Yvonne Evans had her her hand when she attacked him . Pauline admits: 'I thought that was a bit petty, I didn't know you were restricted to one friend in life.' But then Yvonne's behaviour took a more sinister turn. She began making silent phone calls to the couple day and night. Pauline said: 'It unnerved us very much, you don't know why people are making silent calls or who they are.' They discovered Yvonne was the culprit after the police traced the calls. She was given a fixed penalty notice and fine. But Pauline said it only led to her harassment becoming worse. 'She'd walk past the house and stick her fingers up at us. She started shouting abuse through the windows calling us peeping Toms and perverts - it went on like this for four years,' Pauline recalled. 'It got to the stage where I'd wake up and think \"I hope nothing happens today\", I'd always have a sick feeling in my stomach.' Then in March 2011 Tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer and told he didn't have long to live. When Yvonne heard the news, instead of expressing sympathy, she mocked Tony telling him: 'You've got cancer, you are going to die.' She also started making her crank phone calls again. Pauline said: 'Tony was terminally ill so we had precious time left and to have that spoiled by someone making unnecessary phone calls made things worse. Why do it when you know he's dying? Why cause us this much hassle?' The couple again got the police involved and Yvonne pleaded guilty to harassment in court and was fined \u00a3100. She signed a community resolution saying she would stay away from the family but she didn't stick to it. Yvonne, pictured in footage taken by John, would taunt the family about Tony's cancer . When John was visiting one day, he said she threatened him with a four-foot long branch. John said: 'I was pottering around in the garden and she was on the other side of the fence. She started spurting her mouth off about Tony having cancer saying \"oh dear, guess who's got cancer, and guess who's got terminal cancer\". 'I stepped closer and saw she had a weapon - a branch in her hand.' John then filmed Yvonne with his mobile phone appearing to hit him with the branch over the fence. Following Tony's death, John moved in with his mother to support her and he continued to be abused by Yvonne. 'As soon as I walked in the back gate she would be waiting for me,' he said. Tony died in 2012 with no sympathy from Yvonne who instead harassed the family with crank calls . Despite being heterosexual, John said Yvonne would make homophobic jibes towards him as well as calling him a 'w*****' and a 'mummy's boy'. Then one day the abuse became physical after Yvonne's dog attacked John's, Scrappy, after leaping into their garden. John said: 'I heard a crash bang from the garden and Scrappy was in the jaws of a pretty big dog.' John rescued Scrappy and kept Yvonne's dog in the house, causing Yvonne to then climb over the fence, holding\u00a0secateurs, demanding her pet back. 'She started hitting me screaming \"give me my dog back\",' John said. 'The secateurs missed my throat by an inch.' Pauline witnessed the encounter and tried to intervene to stop Yvonne attacking her son. 'I was frightened for our lives. We told her to get back into her own garden and then we'd give her her dog,' she said. 'We called the police, I dread to think what she could have done.' Yvonne told the police she had been acting in self defence so Pauline and John decided not to press charges. Instead, they collected all the evidence they had of Yvonne's abusive behaviour and submitted it to the owner of the community park. This led to Yvonne being served an eviction notice and she was told to leave within eight weeks. Pauline said Yvonne continued to be 'nasty' in this time and once again John said she hit him when he caught her prowling around his mother's house at night. The mother and son were delighted and relieved when Yvonne was finally evicted. 'I'm not sorry she's gone I have a much more peaceful life now and can grieve for Tony,' Pauline said. 'I'm so sorry he wasn't here to see the day she went. 'Soon I will get some new neighbours and I pray to God they will be nice and not neighbours from hell.'

        "article": "Restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield, 79, claimed living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life . An Australian festival organiser has slammed Tasmania as a state full 'dregs, bogans and third-generation morons'. In a scathing article, long time restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield, 79, claimed living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life and the decade he spent there left him feeling bitter and depressed. 'I think I came very close to either a nervous breakdown or suicide. I just started to fall apart,' he told Fairfax. Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival in what he claims was an attempt to help Tasmanians take advantage of its grand heritage. He decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent. Mr Schofield said he was offered $300,000 for the 2014 festival which was a reduction from the $400,000 the government offered in the previous year. 'We were deeply wounded and shocked,' he said. '[The festival] was supported by a lot of wonderful people down there, who shared the vision that the government wouldn't. Anyhow, we threw up our hands and said, 'We're not going to do it anymore. F**k you.' Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival, but decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent . After receiving an offer from Queensland arts organisations he decided to move the festival to Brisbane. Mr Schofield said his daughters recognised that the battle he was waging with the Tasmanian Government took a toll on him and decided to stage an 'intervention'. 'The whole process knocked me about terribly and I honestly started going to pieces,' he said. 'I was drinking, I was taking a lot of tablets, and stupidly driving when I was in no condition to drive. I was suffering from acute depression.' While Mr Schofield admits he was 'absolutely obsessed, tremendously intrigued' by Tasmania, he continued to blast Tasmanian's for wanting to 'dig it up, chop it down, sell it to the Chinese.' Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania Tweeted the above after\u00a0Mr Schofield said of Tasmania:\u00a0'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons' He added the above despite\u00a0Mr Schofield saying he\u00a0suffered from acute depression after the mishap . He continued: 'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons'. He said he plans to reserve a chapter in his memoirs dedicated to his time in Tasmania called 'Revenge of the Bogans'. Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania responded to Mr Schofield's comments labelling them as 'blatant mistruths'. He tweeted: 'No one cut his funding, he asked for more and spat the dummy when it wasn't given'.",

        "article": "(CNN)This weekend, millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up. Why is this? We'll explore, but first let's get something out of the way: The big fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather won't \"save\" boxing, a sport that has fallen precipitously since its 20th century heyday. If anything, the so-called \"Fight of the Century\" just reinforces the sport's problems, as two aging heroes collide in what might be the last nationally relevant fight for a very long time. There's so much wrong with boxing's business model, but all you really need to understand is this: Most sports fans probably can't name a single active boxer after Mayweather and Pacquiao. Some might know that the long-reigning heavyweight champ is a towering Ukrainian with a boring jab-happy style, but most wouldn't come up with his name (Wladimir Klitschko). Boxing isn't fading away because we've finally awoken to its brutality but from a combination of catastrophic mismanagement and competition from Mixed Martial Arts -- a younger, more dynamic and better-managed competitor. The rocket rise of MMA's premier organization, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has matched boxing's equally dramatic decline. In the course of just two decades, the UFC has grown from a freaky-violent carny sideshow into a mainstream sport. In fact, the fan base of the UFC now rivals that of the world's most popular fighting sport: ice hockey. Some aficionados spin elaborate defenses of the hundreds of fist fights that break out every year in NHL games, claiming they make the game safer by punishing dirty play.  But that's so weak. Everyone knows why the NHL hasn't cracked down on fighting hard enough to end it: fans love it way too much. As the hockey announcer Don Cherry once said, \"When [legendary tough guy] Bob Probert was fighting, did you ever see anyone get out of their seat and go get coffee.\" But why do we like to watch fights in the first place? Over the past 20 years, I've watched boxing and MMA in a spirit of nervous fascination. Watching fighters kick, punch and strangle each other, I'd be thinking, I'm a civilized person. I appear not to be a sociopath. So why am I watching? What's wrong with me? And what's wrong with all of us? Who among us hasn't felt the giddy, guilty thrill of a fistfight breaking out -- whether in a schoolyard, a hockey rink or a prize ring? We all claim to hate violence, but I think we protest too much. Inside us all, there's a creature that adores it. How else are we to explain our yen for carnage in rough sports, films, gory video games and literature? So is that it? Are we drawn to a big fight like Mayweather-Pacquiao simply by bloodlust and barbarism? Actually, I think that's only part of the story, and not the biggest part. If we just wanted blood and pain, we wouldn't bother with the tame violence of pay-per-view fisticuffs. Instead, we'd fire up a web browser and watch ISIS snuff videos for free.  But many people who feel no temptation to watch Internet snuff feel sorely tempted to watch a big fight. What's going on? There's a great literature on boxing, with contributions from writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. For them, boxing isn't really a sport. You can't play boxing like you can play tennis. They compared boxing to a rite, or a religion, or above all to theater, complete with spotlit performers improvising on an elevated stage. A fight was drama sweated down to the bones -- a metaphor for the whole human condition, with everything noble and ugly on display. While it may seem like a stretch, I think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what's good and noble. Prizefights set up conditions of dramatic adversity that evoke what we admire most in human beings: extremes of courage, grace, fortitude and even heroism. So should we feel virtuous as we watch Mayweather and Pacquiao's epic brain damage contest? I wouldn't go that far. Perhaps such spectacles really should, as most of the world's medical societies insist, be abolished. Most of us feel ambivalent toward prizefighting because we should.  A fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display: the bared fangs, the blood, the frenetic drive to do harm. But all that dark stuff draws out the best stuff, and turns a great fight into a showcase for the indomitability of human will. When Mayweather and Pacquiao clash at center ring on Saturday night, the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in.",

        "article": "The wife of the prominent D.C. rabbi who was caught filming dozens of women changing in a ritual bathroom at their synagogue has spoken out for the first time since his arrest last fall. A little more than a month before her husband, Bernard Freundel, is set to be sentenced for his crimes, his wife Sharon Freundel held a lecture at a Maryland Jewish school about how to respond to traumatic experiences. While Mrs Freundel did not directly address her personal drama, she did allude to the scandal which shocked her community at the beginning of the talk. 'As you all know, I've become an expert in PTSD,' Mrs Freundel told the room of about 150 people, according to the Washington Post. \u00a0'Researching this has been so therapeutic.' Sharon Fruendel (right), wife of disgraced D.C. Rabbi Bernard 'Barry' Freundel (left) gave a speech on March 22 which alludes to her family's recent scandal. In October, her husband was charged with spying on dozens of women who changed in their synagogue's ritual bathroom . It was in October that Sharon's husband Bernard 'Barry' Freundel was arrested after a police investigation revealed he had spied on dozens of women who changed in the ritual mikvah bathrooms at the Kesher Israel Congregation synagogue in D.C. Freundel first came under investigation when a woman changing came across a suspicious \u00a0clock radio in the bathroom which is used mainly by people converting to Judaism and Jewish women to cleanse following menstruation. In February, the 63-year-old rabbi pleaded guilty to 52 misdemeanor charges of \u00a0voyerism and he is set to be sentenced on May 15. In the weeks following her husband's arrest, Freundel left D.C. for Maryland, where one of her daughter's lived. While her husband has granted her a Jewish divorce, the two are still legally married. On March 22, she spoke to the group fathered at Charles E Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland, \u00a0for about 90 minutes. During the talk she cited several instances of 'trauma' in the Hebrew bible and how the biblical figures responded to their crises as lessons for life. She seemed to address her own personal issues with her husband when she quoted Jewish philosopher Joseph Soloveitchik, who wrote that marriage is a place people can go 'when we believed nobody 'gets' us.' Barry Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of misdemeanor voyeurism in February. He is set to be sentenced in May. Pictured above leaving D.C. Superior court on February 19 . However, Soloveitchik ends by saying that ultimately, the answer 'is to turn to the one above. The one above will get it.' Several members of the Kesher community were in attendance to hear Freundel talk, and respected her more for it. 'She didn't want to represent the scandal anymore,' one longtime Kesher member told the Post. 'It gave her sense of how she survived it and how the community can survive it. She was educating the community in surviving its misfortune.' Mrs Freundel is also the director of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at the Jewish Primary Day School in northwest D.C. Prosecutors said Freundel recorded the women between early 2009 and October 2014 using devices installed in two changing rooms for the National Capital Mikvah, which is next to the Kesher synagogue. Investigators found six video files of nude women, with one showing Freundel's face as he set up the camera, prosecutors said. Police searched his home and his office at Maryland's Towson University, where he was an associate professor, and seized computers, electronic devices, remote controls, hard drives and cameras hidden in a fan and a tissue box, they said. Prosecutors said at least 52 women were recorded nude or partially nude on 25 different dates from March 2012 to September 2014. Voyeurism carries a three-year statute of limitations. Investigators also found that Freundel secretly recorded about 100 more women between 2009 and September 2014 in a bathroom at the National Capital Mikvah, they said. Each of the 52 counts of voyeurism carries a penalty of a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, or $2,500 for those committed after June 2013. One of the victims, Stephanie Doucette, said in a statement: 'I continue to be profoundly shocked and upset by Rabbi Freundel's outrageous conduct, which violated the security, trust and beliefs of so many women.' Freundel is also facing civil lawsuits and was fired from Kesher Israel in December. His congregation has included Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.",

        "article": "Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute says forcing teachers to promote gay relationships would be making them choose between their faith and their job . Schools should be forced to promote gay relationships in sex education lessons, union leaders say. The National Union of Teachers has called for a \u2018positive portrayal of same sex relationships\u2019 in lessons to be made \u2018compulsory\u2019 under the next government. It said MPs had a duty to tackle \u2018homophobia, biphobia and transphobia\u2019 in schools and create a \u2018positive climate of understanding about sexuality\u2019. But critics accused the NUT of \u2018thought control\u2019 and said the \u2018intolerant\u2019 proposals risked \u2018oversexualising\u2019 children at a young age. Meanwhile, Christian groups warned it would compel teachers at faith schools to act against their beliefs. However, the union said the changes were needed to tackle prejudice which was \u2018still strongly prevalent in our schools\u2019. Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: \u2018This motion is itself an act of intolerance towards mainstream Christians and their beliefs. It would force Christian teachers to have to choose between their faith and their job. \u2018I wonder whether Christian members of the NUT who have paid their dues can expect any help from the NUT when their jobs are on the line.\u2019 He added that Church schools already teach \u2018love and tolerance\u2019 of others without having to explicitly approve of same sex relationships. The proposal was contained in a motion on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights passed by the NUT at its annual conference in Harrogate yesterday. It stated: \u2018Conference instructs the executive to call upon the present and future government to \u2026 make it compulsory that all schools\u2019 sex education policies include a positive portrayal of same sex relationships.\u2019 The NUT said only 10 per cent of LGBT teachers felt confident to be \u2018out\u2019 to students. Other proposals included promoting LGBT History Month \u2013 which celebrates gay and transgender rights movements \u2013 in every school. The motion also advocated supporting transgender students and staff \u2018while transitioning and after\u2019. Christine Blower, NUT General Secretary, said: \u2018We need education policy that develops curriculum for children and young people that supports the democratic values of a diverse Britain \u2013 including LGBT equality.\u2019 Christine Blower, National Union of Teachers General Secretary, has called for a \u2018positive portrayal of same sex relationships\u2019 in lessons to be made \u2018compulsory\u2019 under the next government . The law would also see teachers at Muslim and Jewish schools compelled to promote gay marriage and other issues that go against their beliefs. The proposal comes amid a row over the government\u2019s new requirement for schools to teach \u2018fundamental British values\u2019, which include tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. Christian schools have complained they were branded \u2018intolerant\u2019 and marked down by Ofsted after children were asked about gays and lesbians. Durham Free School is set to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed \u2018discriminatory\u2019 views towards people of other faiths. Meanwhile, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland was put in special measures after failing to meet Ofsted\u2019s British values criteria. Inspectors were said to have asked pupils if they knew what lesbians \u2018did\u2019 and if any of their friends felt trapped in the \u2018wrong body\u2019. The drive was formed in response to the Trojan Horse scandal in which Muslim hardliners allegedly tried to impose an Islamic agenda on schools in Birmingham. The NUT motion renewed fears teachers would be required to go beyond their remit in tackling such a sensitive subject. Andrea Williams from Christian Concern said: \u2018This kind of policy is dangerous for our children who are being oversexualised at a very young age. Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed \u2018discriminatory views\u2019 toward people of other faiths . \u2018They are being introduced to concepts and having normalised same sex relationships which robs them of their innocence and is not good for their emotional and moral wellbeing.\u2019 Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: \u2018The rights of groups who oppose gay marriage on sincere religious grounds should be respected as much as those who support gay marriage. Thought control should not be promoted by the NUT.\u2019 A Church of England spokesman said it is \u2018fully committed to sex and relationship education that allows room for exploration and discussion of relationships, within a framework of Christian values\u2019. Sex and relationships education is mandatory for pupils at council-run secondary schools. It is also compulsory for children aged between five and 14 at council-run schools to learn about sex as part of the science curriculum.",

The 60-year-old was called to serve on a case involving a car crash and had to answer a couple of questions about his relatives. However, when it came to a question about the jurors legal experience the sitting Judge refrained from making Roberts answer, saying, 'Obviously we know what you do for a living, sir.' Top judge: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reported for jury duty on Wednesday in Rockville, Maryland . Roberts sat incognito with the other called jurors and answered questions about his sister in Indiana who is a nurse and his brother-in-law, who works with the Indiana State Police. The only giveaway that he was one of the top judges in the highest court in the land and part of the judiciary branch of US Government was the two security staff he brought with him. According to the Washington Post, Roberts squeezed in with the 50 others jurors and was not selected in the case involving a car crash on Connecticitu Avenue from 2013. Judge Rubin asked jurors to raise their hands if they had certain jobs and when it came to medicine, Roberts said his sister was a nurse. Solemn duty: President Barack Obama is sworn in for his second term as President of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 . Tagged 'Juror 49', Roberts said he didn't think this disqualified him from the case and neither was the fact his brother-in-law was a cop. When Judge Rubin was about to ask if anyone had legal experience he asked 'Juror 49' to approach the bench and said, 'Sir, good morning. How are you?' 'Very good, thank you' said Roberts. 'I've discussed this with counsel. Obviously we know what you do for a living, sir'. Other Supreme Court Justices have reported for jury duty. Justice Elena Kagan twice has served on a jury and President Obama was summoned for duty in Illinois in 2010.",

        "article": "Homicide conviction: Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, arrives for verdicts at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju, South Korea . The South Korean ferry captain responsible for a sinking that killed more than 300 people has had his sentence increased to life in prison. Lee Joon-seok had been ordered to serve 36 years in prison for negligence and abandoning passengers aboard the Sewol, by a district court following last year's disaster. But this was increased to life in prison today by an appellate court that convicted him of homicide by account of his 'willful negligence'. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year, killing 304 people. Most of the victims were teenagers who were en route to a southern island for a school trip. Victims' relatives criticised the original verdict which had acquitted him of homicide, saying it was too lenient. But his sentence was increased because the Gwangju High Court additionally convicted him on the homicide charges while upholding most of other charges that led to his November conviction, according to a court statement. The appellate court sentenced 14 other navigation crew members to 18 months to 12 years in prison, the statement said. In November they had received sentences of five to 30 years in prison. The court said it decided on Lee's homicide conviction because he fled the ship without making any evacuation order though he, as a captain, is required by law to take some measures to rescue his passengers. Lee's behavior was 'homicide by willful negligence,' the court judged. 'For whatever excuses, it's difficult to forgive Lee Joon-seok's action that caused a big tragedy,' the court statement cited the verdict as saying. Lee and the 14 crew members have been the subject of fierce public anger because they were among the first people rescued from the ship when it began badly listing on the day of the sinking in April last year. Scroll down for video . Disaster:\u00a0Helicopters try to help passengers stranged on the South Korean ferry which sank on its way to Jeju island from Incheon, some 20 kilometres off the island of Byungpoong in Jindo, South Korea . Devastating: A girl is rescued from the stricken vessel while relatives grieve for the victims of the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, whose captain has today been jailed for life . Lee has said he issued an evacuation order, but the court statement said two of the 14 crew members acknowledged that there was no evacuation order. Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn't remember there any evacuation orders made by crew members before they helped each other to flee the ship. Judges sit to preside over verdicts for the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol's crew members who are charged with negligence and abandonment of passengers in the disaster at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju . Court spokesman Jeon Ilho said both prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal the verdicts. Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, was sentenced to life in prison . A year after sinking, 295 bodies have been retrieved but nine others are missing. There is still lingering public criticism against the government over its handling of the sinking, the country's deadliest maritime disaster in decades. Violence occurred during a Seoul rally led by relatives and their supporters earlier this month, leaving dozens of people injured. Last week, South Korea formally announced it would salvage the ship from the ocean floor off the country's southwest coast. Relatives of the victims hope that might locate the missing, including four students, and help reveal more details about the sinking. Some experts are skeptical about those wishes and remain opposed to spending taxpayer's money to lift the civilian vessel. Officials say the salvage job is estimated to cost \u00a368 million and take 12 to 18 months. Authorities blame excessive cargo, improper storage, botched negligence and other negligence for the sinking, and have arrested about 140 people. Critics say higher-level officials haven't been accountable.",

        "article": "(CNN)An Amnesty International report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women's rights activists in Afghanistan. The report, entitled \"Their Lives on the Line,\" examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women's rights not only by the Taliban and tribal warlords, but also by government officials. Its publication is timely. The brutal murder of Farkhunda, a young woman in Afghanistan, whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in Kabul, shocked the world. Accused of burning pages from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, many protested the 27-year-old's innocence. But what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history, women in Afghanistan became pallbearers, hoisting the victim's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves, under the gazes of men; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women's solidarity as they marched along the streets. In a country ranked in 2011 by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women, this feminist act seemed perilous. Latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard. In 2013, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20% from the previous year, although the number of civilian victims had decreased, said Amnesty in the report. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Afghanistan at the time, Jan Kubis, told the U.N. Security Council that \"the majority (of women killed) is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country. \"Women activists have been deliberately targeted.\" And according to the human rights group, little support has come from those in power. \"The Afghan government has done very little to protect them,\" Amnesty's Afghanistan researcher, Horia Mosadiq, tells CNN. \"Perpetrators almost always walk free, and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored. \"Many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities, it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded.\" During the attack on Farkhunda, \"many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed,\" says Mosadiq. Twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack, but she argues that this is insufficient. \"Suspending police officers is not enough, those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence.\" But what is striking is the resilience of the activists, who continue their work despite their lives being on the line. \"It was a remarkable moment,\" says Mosadiq, recalling the female protesters at Farkhunda's funeral. \"Unlike anything I have seen in my decades of campaigning for women's rights in our country.\" Selay Ghaffer, 32, is a women's rights activist and spokesperson for the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in Kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy, social justice and women's rights. The party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing Afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice. Taking part in Farkhunda's funeral and protests against her death, she tells CNN that despite the onslaught of violence against Afghan women over the years, this was the worst case. But the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message. \"So the women of Afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore... And we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women,\" said Ghaffer. \"So this is why we decided to carry the dead body of Farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that (a) man has to do this job.\" Surprisingly, she says that male onlookers supported their mission, although they are in the minority overall in the country. \"Men (at the funeral), they said you have to do this, because this is how you can change the hatred in Afghanistan. \"Without men, it is not possible for women to get their rights,\" she says. \"So these men and women were working together. But at the same time, women need to step forward for their rights.\" Mosadiq says the fight for women's rights was established a while ago. \"Women's activism in Afghanistan is nothing new -- the women's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001, and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains. \"These gains are under threat now, however, and some are even rolled back. It's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen.\" Ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work, received through emails and phone calls, at her home and office. But she says she knew what she was getting herself into. \"I knew it wasn't an easy task. There might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights. \"As a woman, I want to struggle more (for my rights), I want to have more people around me, to struggle with me.\" Mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution, although the response to Farkhunda's killing, from both men and women, has been a \"silver lining.\" Ghaffer, however, believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving. Interestingly, it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight. \"I must say strongly that it was my father (who inspired me), who is not any more with me, because he... died three months ago,\" she says. \"He always told me that women always suffered in this country,\" she says, her voice overcome with emotion. \"And you have to struggle for your rights. Because in this traditional, patriarchal society, nobody will give these rights (to) you.\" She realizes how lucky she is, she adds, in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models. Ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women, not least to the victim of the recent, horrific mob violence. \"So if I should not do it, if another sister is not doing it, then who will do it? Who will get the rights for us? We have to struggle for it. \"If we keep our silence, more Farkhundas will be killed in this country.\"",

        "article": "The chilling reenactment of how executions are carried out in Indonesia which was broadcast to millions of viewers is set to become a brutal reality for Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran. Time has run out for the Bali Nine ringleaders who will face 12 marksmen, with only three of them holding loaded guns, at the stroke of midnight on\u00a0Tuesday night - 3am Eastern Standard Time - in the depths of the jungle on\u00a0Nusakambangan Island in Java. The Australian men are expected to be led from their isolated cells in Batu prison through the wildly dense tropical forest up a 3km steep winding track to a place\u00a0called Nirbaya - or more appropriately known as Death Valley. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be given white clothing to wear and a choice whether to be blindfolded as they face the firing squad at the stoke of midnight on Tuesday . The final chilling steps to execution in Indonesia . A disturbing recreation of the execution was aired on Indonesian TV the day before five foreign drug traffickers were killed in January . Millions of viewers watched the chilling reenactment of the execution played out on national TV . The condemned pair will be given white clothing to wear, which symbolises the afterlife, before beginning their fatal trek and are given the option to be blindfolded with a piece of fabric before facing the firing squad who will be lined up anywhere from five to 10 metres in front of them. The confronting decisions continue for the death row inmates with the opportunity to choose whether to stand, sit or kneel before a cross is placed over their hearts acting as a target for the 12 riflemen - of which nine will have blanks and only three will have live rounds. If necessary their hands or feet will be tied to a 3m high pole or worse still - a wooden execution chair. The offender is then given a final chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes before the riflemen are ordered to shoot them in the heart. It is then that the executing commander brandishes his sword as a sign for the 12 shooters to begin to fire their rifles. If the doctor confirms once the fires have been shot that the prisoner is still breathing -\u00a0the executing commander orders for a pistol be put to the temple just above the ear for a final shot. However, the shooting can continue on the condemned, if the doctor declares that there is still signs of life. Some of the last words the men  will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian. The Australian men will be given a maximum of three minutes to calm down before being shot in the heart . Three shooters will have live rounds while nine other rifelemen will have blanks . The TV footage broadcasted four months ago showed Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles practicing for the following day's execution by repeatedly firing at bullseye targets . Not even refusing to sign their death warrants on Saturday will delay the pair's deaths for their hand in plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali 10 years ago. The stark reality struck for the pair when they requested their final wishes - Sukumaran to continue his love of painting right up until the bitter end and Chan, who became a minister during his time behind bars, to attend a church service with his family. The prisoners can also make a final written request which can include declaring their guilt or innocence, along with how and where they wish to be buried. One of the last paintings Sukumaran will ever create was shown to the media on the Javanese island by his Australian lawyer Julian McMahon on Saturday. The haunting self portrait depicts a gun shot wound to his heart. This comes as coffins with both men's names and Wednesday's date were inscribed on wooden crosses by local funeral director Suhendra Putro.

Sukumaran's self portrait shows a gaping wound on his heart (left) and the chilling words '72hrs just started' on the back of the frame (right) The television report also listed 27 very precise points about how the execution will be carried out .

The eerie step-by-step recreation on Channel 1 shows a white figure wearing a black hood over its head with its arms tied behind its head - while the firing squad is represented by a row of toy or robotic looking figures.

        "article": "His neighbors wouldn't let him build a film studio. So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan. The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco.",

In fact, a recent study has suggested that combining a moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day could actually lower your levels of bad cholesterol by more than a low-fat, or moderate-fat diet without avocados. Avocados are a great source of healthy, mono-saturated fats, which have been shown to lower bad cholesterol and reduce a person's risk of heart attack or stroke . CRANBERRIES . What are the benefits? As many of you will know, cranberries have been used for years as an aid against urinary tract infections. But studies have suggested these berries could also have a wide range of other benefits \u2013 from improving our heart health, helping to prevent certain cancers, to boosting our oral health and helping to reduce infections. What helps to make them just so good for us are the polyphenols that are present in those little red berries. Polyphenols have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, to name just a few. Just be careful where you get your cranberry intake from, as cranberry juice and juice drinks are often full of sugar. Polyphenols found in cranberries are reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Studies have shown they can improve heart health and help prevent certain cancers . BLUEBERRIES . What are the benefits? With their high levels of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, blueberries have been linked to all kinds of health benefits, including heart health, cancer prevention, enhanced brain function and improved eyesight. And if that's not enough, some studies have suggested that the antioxidants in blueberries could help to delay the ageing process \u2013 a much cheaper alternative to all those anti-ageing creams. PUMPKIN SEEDS . What are the benefits? We all know how nutritious pumpkins are, but there's even more to be said for the pumpkin seed. It provides great levels of protein, fibre, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous, and is a rich source of zinc - important for immunity, cell growth and division, as well as sleep, mood, and eye and skin health. It's not surprising it's been dubbed a 'superseed'. A handful of these little seeds make a great, nutrient-packed snack, or add them to your porridge for a tasty nutrient boost.

In two years' time, the Scandinavian nation is slated to become the first in the world to phase out radio entirely. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally. According to officials in Oslo, many in this nation of 5 million have already made the move. On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations. On the Digital Audio Broadcasting network, there are four times that number. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. \"Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,\" Widvey said in a news release. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. But the country's radio waves won't cut out all once, a blog post on Radio.no explained. Radio will be phased out region by region, starting in January 2017 and concluding in December.",

        "article": "A little boy has undergone more than 50 operations to have his entire face painstakingly rebuilt. Billy Mitchell, now seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. He endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities \u2013 which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features. He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head, which was left there for nine weeks. Billy Mitchell, seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes malformations . The surgeries carried risks including meningitis, brain damage, catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death, but Billy pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face. Billy\u2019s mother, Denise Mitchell, 47, said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born. \u2018When I saw him I had an overwhelming sense of love. But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,\u2019 she said. \u2018I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.\u2019 It was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. Children with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes. After his birth, doctors feared Billy would not last the night. The next day Mr and Mrs Mitchell, who live in Hertfordshire, were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine. Specialists feared Billy's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone, blocking his airway. Billy, pictured with his twin sister Lois, has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt . But miraculously, Billy held  on, and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children\u2019s hospital where he had thin, metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe. He remained in a critical condition, surrounded by tubes and machines. Finally, when he was a month old, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister Lois and older sister Darcy, then five. But he often stopped breathing in the night, and at 10 weeks old Mrs Mitchell heard him crying. Apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births. The condition is characterised by malformations of the skull, mid-face, hands and feet. The skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally. The mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken. Some children with the condition have fused fingers and toes. Early surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows. And operations can be carried out to re-model a child's face. She noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball, causing his eye to pop out. After rushing to a doctor, he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week. Children with Apert syndrome have very small eye orbits, meaning more of their eyeball is exposed. Billy's eye orbits were so shallow, especially the left, that his eye regularly popped out of its socket. Doctors advised Billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer. Just six weeks later, he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head. Known as a \u2018front orbital advancement\u2019, surgeons opened his skull, detached it, remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw. They also inserted two pins \u2013 each three inches long \u2013 into his head. For six months, the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain. Billy now needs 24-hour care, which has put a strain on family life. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018Luckily Paul and I had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt. \u2018But Darcy was still young and had to grow up fast. When Billy was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head . His fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly. When he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate Billy's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle . \u2018And as for Lois, every time Billy was admitted to hospital, she\u2019d look around wondering where he was. \u2018But she was thriving, passing all the usual milestones. \u2018It was also clear she had a special bond with Billy. Sometimes they\u2019d snuggle up together. \u2018When she learnt to sit up we propped Billy up with cushions and they\u2019d spend ages playing together. And when Lois became mobile she\u2019d fetch Billy his favourite toys.\u2019 Billy\u2019s fingers were fused together \u2013 known as \u2018mitten hands\u2019 \u2013 and so he struggled to clasp things properly. But when he was 17 months old a surgeon at Leeds General Hospital agreed to operate on them. During a nine hour operation, involving bone and skin grafts, he separated Billy\u2019s fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes. In a second operation he finished the process, separating them fully. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018Billy had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing. \u2018He grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself. \u2018Bright as a button he\u2019d would watch Lois intently and began to copy her. As a family we were astounded by his progress. So too were the doctors.\u2019 But the outside world was less understanding, and Mrs Mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram. \u2018Walking down the street one day I heard one woman say to her friend: \"God he looks awful\". Earlier this year Billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks . \u2018I was so upset I went straight home. \u2018Another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see Santa when Darcy noticed some children pointing at Billy. \u2018She told them not to do it because it was rude. Afterwards I overheard their mother saying: \"Well she shouldn\u2019t bring him out should she.\" \u2018If only they knew what Billy was going through.\u2019 But determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool, Mr and Mrs Mitchell sent Billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister Lois. Despite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy, obsessed with cars, reading books, and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister. Since his most recent surgery, Billy loves his new face, his mother Denise said . \u2018He loved life and was determined to join in with everything,\u2019 Mrs Mitchell says. In the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery. During a nine-hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth. His condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle. So earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery, where his face was literally taken apart, reshaped and put back together again to create more room. His head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically, with the skin being pulled down, exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw. His forehead, eye orbits, nose and top jaw were taken apart, reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts. The frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow, as well as pull the existing facial bones forward. The bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame, a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018So far he\u2019s endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much. \u2018But since his recent surgery he loves his news face. When he saw it for the first time without the frame I think he would have done cartwheels if he could. \u2018It was a massive boost to his confidence. \u2018And now, a few months on, he doesn\u2019t even associate himself as having Apert syndrome. \u2018But what\u2019s incredible is the way he\u2019s taken everything in his stride. We can\u2019t thank all the doctors and nurses enough who\u2019ve looked after him. '",

        "article": "March was an impressive month for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal as four Premier League wins from four cemented their place in the Champions League places. And the Frenchman's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece. Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson. Arsene Wenger is March's winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award - his 14th accolade . Wenger with the Manager of the Month Award for April 2002 - when his Arsenal team won the league title . A grey-suited Wenger with his award from October 2000 - one of 14 he has won at Arsenal . Wenger's Manager of the Month award for March 1998 was delivered in an Easter egg . 75 - England . 52 - Scotland . 17 - France . 12 - Northern Ireland . 9 - Italy . 7 - Ireland, Spain . 5 - Portugal . 4 - Wales . 3 - Chile, Holland . 1 - Argentina, Israel, Sweden . The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993, at the start of the Premier League's second season. With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time, it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list. In the 1999-2000 campaign, he won it in August, March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007, claiming the prize in August, October and February. The last of Ferguson's 27 awards came in October 2012, not long before he announced his retirement. A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all, including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign. Before this month's win, Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth. He may have struggled to fill Ferguson's shoes at Old Trafford, but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton. Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs, while Bobby Robson, Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six. Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager. 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal, Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City, Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United, West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City, Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion, Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham, Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Hull City, Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers . The Manager of the Month \u00a0trophy made a nice desk ornament for Everton's David Moyes in September 2004 . Bolton's start to the 2001-02 season earned Sam Allardyce the Manager of the Month prize . Harry Redknapp, then at Southampton, receives the March 2005 award from his son Jamie . Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill shows off his Manager of the Month award for April 2007 . Jose Mourinho has won the prize on three occasions - including here in March 2007 . But 'The Special One' hasn't cleaned up as much as former Wimbledon boss Joe Kinnear (left), who won four . Remarkably, Kinnear was manager of the month in September 1993, March 1994 and then April 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in Septmber 1996. Given Ferguson's dominance, it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list. Wenger's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall, the same as Liverpool. Newcastle United aren't far behind with 13, followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11. English managers dominate the list looking back, with 75 managers from this country having won the prize. The award has been won 52 times by a Scottish manager and 17 times by a Frenchman.",

Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised there would be a strong police presence across Australia to keep the public safe on April 25. Two teenagers remain in custody following raids in Melbourne's south-east after police were tipped off about an imminent attack on Anzac Day ceremonies. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has urged people to continue with their Anzac Day plans, adding security would be ramped up on the day . Sevdet Besim, 18, has been remanded in custody after appearing briefly in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday. Besim, from Hallam, has been charged with conspiring to commit terrorist acts. Another 18-year-old, from Hampton Park, is also expected to be charged with offences relating to preparing for a terrorist act and remains in custody. Mr Abbott has urged Australians not to be deterred by the alleged terror plot and continue with their plans to attend centenary commemorations. Sevdet Besim has been charged in relation to an alleged terror plot targeting Anzac Day ceremonies . One of the houses in Hallam - in Melbourne's south-east - that were raided in the early hours of Saturday morning . Two cars were parked outside the Hallam house on Saturday following police raids in relation to an alleged terror plot . 'The best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is to live your life normally,' Mr Abbott said. He also praised the professionalism of police conducting the early morning raids in metropolitan Melbourne. There were no other specific threats to Anzac Day events in other cities, but Mr Abbott said there would be a strong police presence across Australia nonetheless. Security at the Gallipoli ceremony was a matter for the Turkish government, but Australia had been co-operating in the lead up to the event. Four thousand Turkish police and security personnel would be deployed on the peninsula. 'I want to assure people that everything authorities can do to keep you safe is being done,' Mr Abbott said.

There were no other specific threats to Anzac Day events in other cities, but Mr Abbott said there would be a strong police presence across Australia nonetheless . Anzac Day ceremonies will take place across the country on April 25 to celebrate 100 years since the landing at Gallipoli . Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan lamented that radicalised people could harm others even with rudimentary weapons. 'All you need these days is a knife, a flag and a camera and one can commit a terrorist act,' he told reporters. Deputy Commissioner Phelan acknowledged police did not have the luxury of time in dealing with potential terrorism plots, unlike in drug investigations. They had to act as soon as they thought the public were at risk. Three of the five men who arrested after the raids were released following questioning for most of Saturday. It is expected one of them - a 18-year-old from Narre Warren - will be charged on summons with weapons offences. Two other Narre Warren men, aged 18 and 19, have been released pending further enquiries. Dubbed Operation Rising, more than 200 heavily-armed officers swooped on the Melbourne's south-east about 3am on Saturday, executing search warrants in Narre Warren, Hampton Park, Hallam and Eumemmerring, arresting the men and seizing knives and swords. Authorities have refused to give details of the alleged plot but say police at Anzac activities around Melbourne were the immediate target.",

        "article": "Tehran, Iran (CNN)Traveling to Iran these days, the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words: confident and optimistic. After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon. Businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted, and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy. \"Naturally we are all very happy,\" one woman in central Tehran told us. \"We expect better days economically and culturally. We want better relations with the rest of the world.\" Another man added, \"I have a good feeling about it, because my country will be free of the fear of war.\" But this weekend, just a few miles down the road, Iran's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual National Army Day parade. As the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other countries criticize Iran for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the Houthi rebels who have seized power in much of Yemen, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has praised the military as peacemakers for the Middle East. \"Today, our army is the source of our national stability,\" Rouhani said in his speech at the parade. \"And even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region.\" The country's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with Western media outlets. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq. \"The unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live, and their right to freedom, dictates that all human society is threatened by ISIS, and all humans should unite against ISIS and work against them,\" Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi also repeated Iran's longstanding claim that the U.S. is partly responsible for creating ISIS, which now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. \"If the Americans really didn't create ISIS, and if they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,\" he said. \"But we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain. We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS.\" Iran has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective, while praising its own strategy of training, advising, outfitting and directing Iraqi Shia militias, Kurdish forces and the Iraqi military. But in another apparent softening of rhetoric, a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between Iran and America will fade. \"At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,\" General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, told CNN. \"We would like the U.S. to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the U.S. military leadership,\" Pourdastan continued. \"We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat.\" At the same time, Iran's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual \"Death to Israel, death to the U.S.A.\" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade. The U.S. welcomes some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS, but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield. And for Iran's part, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also rejected direct coordination between the two long-time adversaries. And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical. In a recent televised speech, Khamenei said it was possible that there would be no deal by the June 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all. And Iran's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites. Meanwhile, the White House has been confronted by a Congress that is largely hostile to the negotiations, and has been making the case that a deal cannot be about trust, but about monitoring and verification. \"Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday. \"That's our main concern. And I think that goal, of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation, that goal can be met.\" So far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week. But despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air, there is also fear that things could fall apart if Tehran and Washington aren't willing to make tough concessions.",

        "article": "A second Utah student has filed a lawsuit against the Davis County School District for hiring an English teacher who then allegedly went on to have sex with him and two other boys. Disgraced Davis High School educator Brianne Altice, 35, was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have now filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having six with three boys . The latest lawsuit, filed last week, describes how Altice began flirting with the student, then 16, and other boys in her class, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detail how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Court documents state that Altice's dalliances were an open secret at Davis High, where the running joke among students was: 'Who is Ms Altice sleeping with now?' Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleges that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: Altice is pictured in court in February after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said at the time he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' In February, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion. Altice would be tried separately in each student's case--meaning she'll get three different trials.",

        "article": "It was one of Barcelona's easier nights in the Champions League as Luis Enrique's team brushed aside Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 at the Nou Camp to reach the semi-finals. The 5-1 aggregate victory never looked in doubt as the Spanish side showed signs of returning to their brilliant best, with a combination of experienced stars and blossoming talent in their ranks. Here Sportsmail looks at the five things we have learned from Barca's crushing victory over PSG. Neymar (left) celebrates opening the scoring for Barcelona along with Dani Alves (centre) and Gerard Pique . Neymar is a blend of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . He\u2019s just a child, said Juliano Belletti in the week. Some child. Let\u2019s not go overboard; there\u2019s no way of knowing whether Neymar will reach both the level and consistency of Ronaldo or Messi. But his skill-set and talents seem a combination of those two players, which means he has the potential to be very dangerous indeed. Neymar chases for the ball during the win against Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League quarter-final . Neymar has the blend of Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi in his skillset . Neymar has Messi\u2019s close control when dribbling, he has the flair which Cristiano used to display as a badge of pride \u2013 and winds up opponents in the same way. Both the Real Madrid and Barcelona legends are lethal finishers and Neymar is getting there, as he showed here. There are still parts of his game which he has to improve; his crossing and final pass sometimes leave a little to be desired. But he is in the right place to hone his skills and barring injury, he will be on the Ballon d\u2019Or podium sooner, rather than later. Luis Enrique has strong chance of matching Pep Guardiola\u2019s treble-winning debut season . Barcelona look like genuine treble contenders. They are in the Copa del Rey final, against Athletic Bilbao. They have a two-point lead in La Liga and only six games remain. And three more victories in the Champions League would see them lift the trophy for the fifth time in their history. There are tough games to come; none of the semi-finalists will be pushovers. But the brutal way they dismantled a PSG side that knocked out Chelsea, the English champions-in-waiting, in the previous round, shows the level they are at right now. Luis Enrique celebrates with his coaching staff after Neymar's opening goal at the Nou Camp . They have gone from winning nothing last year to being on the cusp of emulating Pep Guardiola's treble-winning first season. There's life in the old dog yet . Lot of reasons have been given for why Andres Iniesta hasn't been at his best over the past couple of years. The most recent is that Barcelona's new style of play hasn't allowed him to flourish. He's having to play in a deeper role, to allow Neymar more space on the left, and offer a bit more protection in a side that features three totally attack-minded forwards. Andres Iniesta charges at the PSG defence for Barcelona as the Spaniard played close to his best . But it was from deep that Iniesta started his run, shimmying away from Edinson Cavani, beating two more PSG players for pace and then feeding in Neymar, who scored, killing the tie. Iniesta may still be acclimatising to the new methods at Barcelona and changes to the way he has played the game for the past decade, but his immense talent will find a way to adapt. PSG project needs more investment \u2013 as long as it\u2019s sensible investment . Having been knocked out of the Champions League 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona, it\u2019s easily believable that PSG chief Nasser Al-Khelaifi will ready the big bucks to bring a new world star to the club in the summer. Edinson Cavani stands dejected for PSG during the second leg defeat at the Nou Camp . Cavani goes to ground on the touchline in front of PSG boss Laurent Blanc . That really isn\u2019t what they need. Bringing another big name into the mix won\u2019t be helpful; they need to build a squad. They need to sign players appropriate for positions, rather than trying to crowbar stars into the side. Edinson Cavani is a good example. He was a brilliant centre-forward, right now he\u2019s low on confidence and an ineffective foil for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Sign, by all means, but sign smart. Barcelona's big guns blowing apart the landscape . Perhaps then, it wasn't helpful for PSG to see the potency of Barcelona's attacking trio first hand. It took a bit of sculpting, with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez switching places, but now the terrifying trio up front are flying. Luis Suarez (left) Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi celebrate a goal against Atletico Madrid in January . They're on course to record the highest goal tally for a Barcelona front-line in the past decade. Back in 2011-12 the Messi, Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez attack managed 101 - including 75 from Messi himself. So far this season Messi, Neymar and Suarez have 95 in all competitions. And if they reach the Champions League final, they have 10 games in which to do it.",

        "article": "(CNN)The onslaught on Houthis rebels in Yemen continued Tuesday, with the Saudi-led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them. Five days after their first airstrikes, the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the Houthis and supporters of Yemen's longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable, a Saudi source said. Saudi Arabia's navy now controls all Yemeni ports, allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade, according to the source. This effort isn't over, including widespread attempts to locate and destroy Scud missiles still in the country, the source said. The Saudis appear intent on seeing it through, as evidenced by remarks from Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in Riyadh. \"The Houthi militia and agents of the former president -- supported by Iran -- insist to meddle in Yemen, reshuffle the cards, rob the Yemeni will, make a coup against the constitutional legitimacy and reject all peaceful solutions,\" al-Faisal said, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. \"We are not warmongers,\" he added. \"But if war's drums are beaten, we are ready for them.\" The airstrikes -- the latest focused around Aden, Taiz and coastal cities -- come at a cost, and not just to Houthi rebel fighters. The International Red Cross said that intense fighting had brought \"disturbing reports of civilian casualties,\" with some of the worst violence around the port city of Aden. Erich Ogoso, a spokesman with the United Nations' humanitarian agency, reported 182 dead and hundreds more wounded just between last Wednesday and Sunday. Some 75,000 people have been displaced in the past week,  many health facilities shut down and food prices have skyrocketed. \"Increasing hostilities have led to (the) targeting of schools, health facilities and other social infrastructure,\" Ogoso said. \"... There are reports of damage to residential areas in different cities, and in Aden, minors have reportedly taken part in the fighting on all sides.\" Airstrikes that hit the Al-Mazraq camp for displaced persons near Sanaa killed at least 29 people -- women and children among them, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders. About 1,100 families live in the camp, said U.N.'s humanitarian affairs coordinator for Yemen, Johannes Van Der Klaauw. \"They are,\" he said, \"among the most vulnerable people in Yemen.\" Yemen has been in disarray for some time, beset by widespread poverty and insecurity. Those factors helped terror groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula find homes in the Arab nation, but didn't help its 26 million citizens in their quest for peace and prosperity. The instability escalated as the Houthis, a minority group long marginalized in Yemen, increasingly challenged the government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi (who in 2012 took over for Saleh, who had been in power for 33 years). The Houthis began moving into Sanaa in September, then headed into Aden earlier this month -- advancing despite intermittent (and, time and again, unsuccessful) talks aimed a peaceful political solution to the unrest. Things finally came to a head last week, with Hadi -- who claims to still be President, even though the Houthis control government institutions -- left Yemen. At roughly the same time, Saudi Arabia and its allies came in with force to support Hadi, who they say remains Yemen's legitimate leader. The burgeoning conflict threatened to open a wider rift, not just in the region but in the Muslim world. That's because the Saudis have painted the Houthis as tools of Iran's government, an accusation that also reflects the fact Saudi Arabia (and their allies in the coalition) are predominantly Sunni Muslims, while Iran and the Houthis are Shiites. The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Saud al-Faisal as saying Tuesday that he would not condemn Iran, but would instead test the country's intentions \"by extending our hands to it as a Muslim neighbor to open a new page.\" If those two countries could achieve real cooperation, it could ease the pressures that are tearing Yemen apart. On the other side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that officials in his country and Saudi Arabia can help bring about a \"political solution\" in Yemen, according to Iran's state-run Press TV, citing AFP. If they don't, war could inflame the entire region. \"We strongly object to the military solution in Yemen,\" Amir-Abdollahian said, reiterating a view made by other Iranian officials. \"We believe that the Saudi military attack against Yemen is a strategic mistake.\"",

Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott\u2019s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",

Click the Start button below to play Kuku Kube . Kuku Kube (pictured) is available for free on Facebook, Android, iOS and on desktop browsers. Scores lower than 11 are poor, scores between 15 and 20 is 'lower than average', 21 to 30 is considered normal or average, and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is considered great' Although the game appears relatively simple, and starts with a board of just four coloured squares, it quickly grows to a board of up to 81 squares. And the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time. Players get a point for every correct square identified, but if they click or tap the wrong square they lose a point. Plus, players get just 60 seconds to find the odd square on each board before the timer runs out and the game ends.

There are eight levels, and as a player progresses the squares change orientation or add borders to make it harder. On the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out, but on mobile apps players can't progress until they have scored more than 20 points on each level. The app makers said scores lower than 11 are poor, scores between 15 and 20 is 'lower than average', 21 to 30 is considered normal or average, and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is 'great.' 'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers, but isn't intended to replace a full or partial eye examination . 'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers. 'You should identify the difference, if possible, and\u00a0share your result with your friends.' But they stressed:\u00a0'Even though this test can be very accurate, it should never be used to replace a doctor's visit. '[It] provides basic information and guideline for your eyesight and colour test, and is not intended to replace a full or partial eye examination.' Eyesight and colour was recently linked to how we perceive the world by Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus. He explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can\u2019t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. \u2018Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we\u2019d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. \u2018Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,\u2019 he continued. The blue and black (or gold and white) dress that sweeped the internet last month revealed just how differently two people can see the world. But it's not just about lighting conditions or optical illusions - evidence is mounting that until we have a way to describe something, we may not see its there. Ancient languages, for instance, didn't have a word for blue and scientists believe as a result our ancestors didn't notice the colour even existed. In 1858 William Gladstone, who later became the British prime minister, counted the colour references in the Homer's Odyssey and found blue wasn't mentioned at all. Black is mentioned nearly 200 times and white about 100. Red, meanwhile, is mentioned fewer than 15 times, and yellow and green fewer than 10. And blue doesn't appear in Greek texts, the Koran, ancient Chinese stories, and an ancient Hebrew version of the Bible, according to a German philologist named Lazarus Geiger. Egyptians, who were the only culture that could produce blue dyes, were the first ancient civilisation to have a word for the colour blue and there remain tribes today who don't have a word for blue, such as the Himba people in Namibia. Several years ago, researchers showed some of the Himba tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one blue. The study found they could not pick out which one was different from the others, or took much longer to make sense of it. However, the same tribe has many different words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they could pick it out immediately. Researchers showed the Himba tribe in Namibia  11 green squares with one blue. The study found they couldn't pick out which was different from the others, but the same tribe has many words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they  picked it out immediately (second top left) 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. \u2018Your visual system isn\u2019t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn\u2019t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it. The colours seen are your brain\u2019s \u201cbest guess.\u201d\u2019",

        "article": "Crystal clear waters have revealed a number of haunting hulls belonging to ships that succumbed to the perils of Lake Michigan over the centuries. The unusual transparency has been caused by surface ice melting, unveiling the boat graveyard at the bottom of the Great Lake, before organisms like plankton conceal them once more. The soul-stirring images were snapped during a routine helicopter patrol by the U.S. Coast Guard, who had a perfect view of normally obscured wreckage in an area where many ships foundered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Scroll down for video . Revealed:\u00a0The 121-foot brig of the James McBride, which ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857, has been revealed following ice-melt in Lake Michigan . Rising Sun: The 133 foot long wooden steamer stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, and can be seen on the bottom of the Great Lake . Glory days: The Rising Sun was owned by a religious group called the House of David when it crashed in October 1917. Members of the group were returning from High Island, where they spend the summer, when it crashed in a sudden snowstorm . Graveyard: The above map shows the Manitou Passage of Lake Michigan, which is home to dozens of shipwrecks due to the unpredictable weather on the lake. The wrecks of the James McBride and Rising Sun were exposed this month after ice melted on the lake . Unpredictable weather makes Lake Michigan home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world with sudden storms, fire, and fog causing the destruction of these many thousands of vessels over the years. The pictures are taken of the shallow waters of the lake off the Leelanau Peninsula near Leland, known as the Manitou Passage, between the mainland of the northwestern Lower Peninsula and North and South Manitou Islands. This area alone is home to dozens of shipwrecks, most which were grounded shipping lumber at the turn of the 20th century. The Coast Guard wasn\u2019t immediately able to identify the wrecks, but with help from fans on Facebook, they learned that two of them are the James McBride and the Rising Sun. The 121-foot brig James McBride ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857. Her remains now lie in 15 feet of water near Sleeping Bear Point. The James McBride is believed to be the first ship to haul cargo from the West Indies all the way back to Chicago, when it completed a trip to Turk Island for salt in 1848, stopping at Nova Scotia on the way back for cod. Eerie: This unknown wreck was captured by the US Coast Guard from a helicopter during a routine patrol over the Great Lake . Rare sightings: Two wrecks can just be seen (top left and bottom right of picture) through the clear waters of Lake Michigan . Stunning scenery: A house can be seen on the edge of the lake which endures unpredictable weather and is home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world . It launched on April fool\u2019s day in 1848 and sank nine years later after carrying a cargo of wood from the Manitou Islands. The Rising Sun was a 133-foot-long wooden steamer which stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, because of an early snow storm. Lifeboats were scrambled and all 32 people on board were saved but she went to pieces. Her wreckage now rests in about 12 feet of water. The Rising Sun was actually first named the Minnie M, but it was renamed the Rising Sun when it was purchased by a religious group called the House of David in 1913. The commune was founded by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in Benton Harbor, Michigan in 1903. Benjamin claimed to be the younger brother of Jesus, and his group of about 900 followers called him King Ben. During the summer, the group lived on High Island - located about thirty miles northwest of Charlevoix, Michigan. In October 1917, Captain Charles Morrison was taking  passengers and crew members from the group back to Benton Harbor where they would spend the winter when a sudden snowstorm hit. The captain tried to make Charlevoix, but the ship pushed west into the Manitou Passage where it crashed into a set of submerged boulders. Everyone on board survived the crash, escaping on two sets of lifeboats. Protected: The wrecks of the stricken vessels are protected by law to stop divers trying to salvage anything from the sunken history . The U.S Park Service, which manages the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, announced last month that the wreckage of the Jennie & Annie was now visible again on the beach halfway between North and South Bar lakes. The schooner grounded off Empire in 1872 and is visible every few years. Beach erosion, waves, wind and variable water levels in the lake cause the wrecks to periodically become visible along the dunes shoreline. Since the shipwrecks are considered public property, they are not allowed to be disturbed. However, divers are allowed to explore the wrecks in warmer weather.

        "article": "Cleared: 53-year-old Graeme Finlay, a former naval serviceman . A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.' In his evidence, the defendant recalled how he was travelling alone on the Canary Islands cruise in January last year and felt shunned when he joined two couples \u2013 including Mr and Mrs Phillips \u2013 for dinner in the restaurant. After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.' Innocent: The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm . Cruise: Finlay went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner (file photo) He described to the court how he swung his arms outwards from his face and felt them connect with Mr Phillips. The 'victims' insisted they had not argued with Finlay or ignored him at dinner and were subjected to a vicious assault as they headed to bed following a relaxing evening. Mrs Phillips briefly lost consciousness when she fell against a wall. In her evidence, she said: 'I saw Ron lying on the bulkhead and this great big guy going boof, boof, boof (she swung a punching motion). 'He must have hit him five times. I put my hand on his arm and told him 'leave him alone you will kill him.' Finlay was later forced to leave the ship and make his own way home. He was interviewed by police and charged.",

        "article": "While young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely, it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves. Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory. They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda, the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing. Chimpanzees crossing a busy road in Kibale National Park in Uganda (above) have learned to look for traffic . Scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads, while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely. It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads. Chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs, researchers have suggested. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. Marie Cibot, a biologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, who led the work, said the spread of road infrastructure in Africa was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries. She said: 'Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals, chimpanzees took into account this risk. 'More than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. 'Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups. Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups.' The researchers say the road in Sebitoli sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph. The researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year. However, chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses. They watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years. They found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed. Adult chimps, like this one, tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely . Females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently. Around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely. They also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time. Chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads. However, on quieter roads, adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups. The researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife. Miss Cibot, who worked on the study with Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Great Ape Conservation Project in Uganda, said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe. The team are hoping to work with the Ugandan authorities to test new safety measures. Miss Cibot said: 'These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. 'Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. 'Mitigation measures, like bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls, should be established in this area.'",

        "article": "A mother whose two sons were mutilated by Boston bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev has said it is 'way too soon' for Mark Wahlberg to be turning the atrocity that maimed her family into a movie. Liz Norden's adult sons, JP and Paul, each lost their right leg when they were hit by the explosive mix of shrapnel and ball-bearings unleashing by the Tsarnaevs' primitive explosives in April 2013. The men, now in their mid-thirties, were received horrific wounds as they shielded friends from the second of two blasts which went off by the finish line at the Boston Marathon almost two years ago. Scroll down for video . 'Way too soon': Liz Norden, right, whose sons JP and Paul each lost a leg in the Boston bombings, has said a planned film by Mark Wahlberg, left, dramatizing the bombings is premature . Real life: Pictured are Norden's adult sons, Paul, left, and JP, right. They each lost their right leg when Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev detonated bombs by the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon . In response to the news that Boston-born celebrity Wahlberg is teaming up with CBS to make a feature film from the most harrowing day of her life, Norden pointed out that for many the pain is still visceral and real. She said: 'I don't think that could ever be re-created. I've sat in the courtroom with survivors and family members and seen what everybody is going through. 'It's been two years... but people who live it day in and day out, their lives are just coming back somewhat. 'For people dealing with putting legs on every day or people who lost loved ones, that doesn't go away.' JP and Paul, who both use prosthetic legs, now help run a charity alongside their mother dedicated to helping fellow amputees. Blast: Explosions at the 2013 Boston Marahton are pictured in the above security footage, released by fedreal prosecutors . Together: Liz is pictured above with her two sons, who now use prosthetic legs and are said to be living a relatively normal life again . At a recent fundraiser covered by local station\u00a0WCVB, JP said he has now recovered enough to live a relatively normal life. He said: 'I'm starting to work and doing things as usual - I'm getting married in October. So I'm great.' However, the victims of the attack still contend daily with the toll taken on their lives by the fanatical brothers. Tamerlan, the elder Tsarnaev, was killed in a firefight not long after the attack. Dzhokhar was captured, and last week was convicted of all 30 charges leveled against him in connection with the bombing. Guilty: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured left in an FBI handout photo and right in a courtroom sketch, was found guilty on 30 separate charges related to the bombing, 18 of which can carry the death penalty . More than half of those charges can be punished by death, and he is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks. JP and Paul have both declined to say whether they think Tsarnaev should be put to death, though their mother has said that he should be. Wahlberg announced his film, which will be called Patriot's Day, in the middle of the highly-publicized trial. CBS Films said the movie will be based on a firsthand account from former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis of the investigation and massive manhunt for the Tsarnaevs. After the announcements other Boston residents weighed in. Eileen McNamara, a former Boston Globe columnist, said: 'How does someone who markets himself as \"a Boston guy\" not see that it is far too soon, that the city is still far too sad for its trauma to be transformed into mass entertainment?' Charlie Wilder of Boston.com also weighed in, saying: 'The trial has served as almost a movie of the events itself, making the concurrent announcement of a fictionalized portrayal feel unnecessary and inappropriate. 'Maybe one day, even someday relatively soon after the trial, turning the events into a film worthy of the story would help the healing and honor the lives of those affected. 'But for now, Wahlberg \u2014 who plays up his Boston roots whenever he gets the chance \u2014 picked the wrong time to break the news.' Wahlberg's representatives did not return calls and emails seeking comment.",

        "article": "Francis Coquelin is determined to take his chance at Arsenal and claims he wants to follow in the footsteps of club legend Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to\u00a0earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I\u2019m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it\u2019s down to the performance I put in every week so I\u2019m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won\u2019t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I\u2019m just trying to do what\u2019s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I\u2019m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it\u2019s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it\u2019s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can\u2019t say definitely because mathematically it won\u2019t be over, so I can\u2019t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March . See the full interview with Francis Coquelin on \u2018Matchday Live with Fletch & Sav\u2019 from 10am this Saturday on BT Sport 1.

        "article": "Siblings will no longer be given priority for school places amid soaring competition because of a booming population, it has emerged. Wandsworth council in London has announced that it is set to remove the rule\u00a0giving an automatic place to a pupil's brothers and sisters even if the family has moved out of the catchment area. This comes after it was revealed that 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school, with more than 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices. In the most oversubscribed areas, four in ten pupils are expected not to get a place at their favourite school amid an escalating crisis over places fuelled by a baby boom and immigration. Wandsworth council has announced that it is set to remove the rule giving priority to pupils' siblings, pictured is\u00a0Honeywell School which has a catchment area of just 182 metres . Wansdworth, which is an affluent borough, has decided to remove sibling priority from September 2016 in a bid to make the process fairer and give priority to children who live closest to schools. The change was also considered in Leeds and is expected to spread to more local authorities within the next few years, according to The Times. Families who move more than 800 metres from their preferred school in Wandsworth will lose their automatic entitlement to a place for younger brothers and sisters. A spokesman for the council said: 'A lot of people are getting school places then moving miles away, in some cases cashing in on house prices while retaining the school place. Siblings then get priority over children living closer to the school. The consultation was drawn up because parents were getting upset about this.' Honeywell, which is one of the most popular schools in Wandsworth, has a catchment area of just 182 metres, despite taking 90 children. None of the appeals for places at the schools were successful. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet CEO said:\u00a0'Giving priority to siblings is tricky; as one Mumsnet user says, 'it's lovely until the kids who live next door to the school can't get in'. 'For parents of two or more, having children at two different primaries can be a logistics nightmare; but for parents of only children, or to those whose children can't get in to nearby schools, it can feel pretty unfair. More than 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school, with 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices . 'On balance, most seem to think it would be sensible to restrict sibling priority to those families still living close to the school.' Wandsworth council announced the decision to consult parents  on the changes in September last year. Speaking at the time, education spokesman Cllr Kathy Tracey said: 'There has been a growing clamour from parents asking us to look at this rule because of mounting evidence that local school places are being offered to children living some distance away simply because they have an older sibling already enrolled there.' Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education at the University of Buckingham, said: 'It's possible this could set a precedent. Canny parents, in order to get into a school, rent a property very close to the school gates then move back to their old property and siblings automatically get aplace. That's very annoying for people who genuinely live near the school. 'I'm sure the sibling rule will come under greater scrutiny if it continues to be abused in the way that it is.' Rachel Burrows from the UK's biggest parenting site Netmums said: 'Changing admission rules so siblings are no longer guaranteed a place at the same school will split parents' opinions. 'On the one hand, many parents will view the move as fairer as it will stamp out the practice of families renting a home near a good school to secure a place then moving out of the area. This has become commonplace near schools rated outstanding by Oftsed and can see kids that live close to a school denied a place in favour of siblings of children already at the school but who don't live locally. 'However, for parents who already have a child at one school but lose out on a place at the same establishment, it will cause chaos. They will face two or more school runs to different schools adding to traffic problems, more school administration and will be forced to buy extra uniforms and school kit. 'The proposals show starkly that the on-going baby boom has put unprecedented pressure on school places and local authorities are struggling to cope.' A surge of appeals is anticipated as families oppose their allocated schools, some of which will be up to two miles from their homes. Labour has released figures showing the number of young children being taught in classes of more than 30 pupils has more than tripled in five years. Data from councils shows that 102,615 pupils aged between five and seven are being taught in so-called supersize classes \u2013 compared with 31,265 in 2010. Councils are due to send out offers to more than 600,000 children for primary school places this September. Early figures obtained by the Daily Mail show that in East Sussex, 15 per cent did not get their first choice \u2013 up from 14 per cent last year. Just over 6 per cent got none of their choices. In Solihull, West Midlands, 13 per cent missed out on their first choice and 4 per cent got none. One school, Oak Cottage Primary School, had six applicants for every place. The figures are repeated in other areas.",

In recent years Villa have struggled to compete but they are a proper club. When I left Arsenal for Villa it was because I felt they shared similar traits - tradition, history and both took pride of place in their communities. Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League and in the early years of the FA Cup, the trophy was almost theirs to keep. Now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter. Aston Villa celebrate in the Wembley dressing room after beating Liverpool to reach this year's FA Cup final . Martin Keown joined Aston Villa in 1986 and made the move because of the club's rich history and tradition . Tim Sherwood has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances. But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient. Talking about getting a club \u2018back where they belong\u2019 can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic. Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O\u2019Neill there were still rumblings of discontent. When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn\u2019t when things are going badly? In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side. Making the final is a fine achievement and Sherwood and his players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club. Aston Villa celebrate winning the European Cup after beating Bayern Munich in Rotterdam 33 years ago .

        "article": "(CNN)In 2001, the Taliban wiped out 1700 years of history in a matter of seconds, by blowing up ancient Buddha statues in central Afghanistan with dynamite. They proceeded to do so after an attempt at bringing down the 175-foot tall sculptures with anti-aircraft artillery had failed. Sadly, the event was just the first in a series of atrocities that have robbed the world of some of its most prized cultural heritage. But historical architecture is also under threat from calamities which might well escape our control, such as earthquakes and climate change. The thought of losing a piece of our collective history is a bleak one. But if loss can't be avoided, technology can lend a hand. Now CyArk, a non-profit company founded by an Iraqi-born engineer, is using groundbreaking laser scanning to ensure that -- at the very least -- incredibly accurate digital versions of the world's treasures will stay with us forever. Ben Kacyra was born in Mosul, Iraq, in 1940. He moved to the United States in 1964, and in the 1990s he was instrumental in the design of the first portable laser scanner. He founded CyArk, a company that specializes in digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture, in 2003. \"Two events happened that really influenced me and my wife,\" he told CNN's Nick Glass, \"The Taliban blew up the Buddhas and an earthquake happened in Bam, in Iran. \"It demolished a whole mud city. So we looked at each other and we said, you know, sometimes you can't prevent an earthquake, obviously, and it's very expensive to go back and rebuild, but if it had been scanned, our children and grandchildren would get the opportunity to come back and learn the history of that place.\" Since then, Kacyra has been doing exactly that: in a 2011 TED talk he explained his quest to preserve our \"collective treasure\", and he has a plan to scan 500 World Heritage sites in five years. So far, the list of completed scans includes Ancient Thebes, Chichen Itza, Fort Laramie, Mesa Verde, Mount Rushmore, Petra, Pompeii, Rapa Nui, the Sydney Opera House, Tikal, and his native Mosul. The idea is not just to protect endangered structures, but to offer free educational access to the digital recreations of important monuments via the web. \"We have that data, and if something -- God forbid -- happens to these, the data is there,\" says Kacyra. In fact, current events have already caught up with the project: the Royal Tombs of Kasubi, in Uganda, were destroyed in 2010 by suspected arson. CyArk had mapped them a year earlier, and that could lead to the reconstruction of what was lost. \"I'm constantly looking at what's happening in Iraq and Syria. \"I'm so glad that we had already started and developed the tools that allowed us to go and be proactive to capture some of these things before these very unfortunate events.\" To scan the surroundings, CyArk uses a portable, eye-safe laser device based on a technology called Lidar -- a portmanteau of the words light and radar. It accurately maps a physical area much like a radar, but using lasers instead of radio waves. \"We have a very powerful laser that sends a beam of light  pulsing 50,000 times per second,\" explains Kacyra, \"which means that it's collecting 50,000 points of everything that's in front it as it pulses up and down and in a circular fashion, generating the geometry of everything that's in the space around it.\" In other words, \"We gave the world a 3D laser scanner that has revolutionized how reality is captured.\" Although its focus is in providing open access to cultural heritage, CyArk is also attracting interest for alternative uses of the technology. \"We are discovering applications way beyond what we had anticipated,\" says Kacyra. \"For example, the Highway Patrol wants to use it in accident reconstruction on the road or in crime scene investigations. Where did the bullets go, trajectories and all that - this gives you the entire thing in minutes and then you can do all the analysis work.\" Not even Hollywood is immune from the allure of laser scanning. \"Imagine it going all the way to art, the movies, movie sets. My wife got really excited about the first use in the movie field.\" Before founding CyArk, Kacyra had developed a similar technology called Cyrax, which he then subsequently sold. This technology was first used during the production of the 1997 sci-fi cult movie Starship Troopers, to scan an underground cave. \"They found out it was going to cost too much money to measure the cave so they could model it, something like half a million dollars and six weeks. \"They had heard about our scanning system so we went there. I think we did it for 20,000 dollars, and in a day or two, and it got used in a movie for the first time. \"It's ubiquitous now in the movie industry for virtual sets.\"",

The England number one appeared devastated after the final whistle at Old Trafford and acknowledged that City's bid to retain their Premier League title was over. 'That's one of my worst in a Man City shirt, definitely,' Hart said after a morale-sapping 4-2 defeat saw under-fire Manuel Pellegrini's men go four points adrift of neighbours United and 12 behind runaway leaders Chelsea. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart, pictured with Frank Lampard, was disappointed with his side's display . Hart was unable to keep out goals by United's Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling . Manchester City are four points behind rivals United . The 27-year-old has even given up on knocking Arsenal out of second place. 'It's essential to try and finish third,' he added. 'We've got to get our heads down and win these massive games.' City had looked dominant in the early stages, racing into a 1-0 lead that they could have extended before Ashley Young's equaliser triggered a derby demolition. 'Not many teams have put us to the sword like that,' Hart said. 'United know what they are doing, they took their chances. Hart, pictured saluting the travelling City fans, does not understand why his side are struggling for form . 'It's hard to take. We've won enough of them to know how to lose properly though and we weren't good enough after the first 15 minutes.' Hart added that City had let their fans down and revealed he was at a loss to explain a dramatic loss in form since the turn of the year that has seen them take 18 points from a possible 39. 'It would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we've played well and been unfortunate in some games,' he said. 'I'm hurting from this defeat. There's a lot of emotion running through me. Let's see how it feels on Monday, we'll think about it and we'll go again.'",

        "article": "The earthquake disaster in Nepal has highlighted how Earth's land masses are already in the process of forming a new supercontinent. That's according to one researcher who travelled to the country to study how the Indian and Eurasian plates are moving together. And using new techniques, researchers can now start examining the changes due to take place over the next tens of millions of years like never before. Earth's continents are slowly moving together (left), and in 50 to 200 million years they are expected to form a new supercontinent called Amasia (right). In 2012 a study suggested this may be centered on the North Pole. Recent evidence is revealing how this will compare to the ancient supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea . The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But, as reported by Peter Spinks from the Sydney Morning Herald, Curtin University geologist Dr Zheng-Xiang Li travelled to Nepal to study the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But new techniques are allowing experts to study the changes in unprececdented ways. Where exactly this supercontinent will form, however, has been the cause of some debate. While some had suspected it would be centered around Africa, a study by Yale University in 2012 suggested that the North Pole would actually be the centre point. North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing, while Asia will join the Americas, according to the study. They said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years. Despite already being attached to Eurasia, the Indian plate is continuing to move North at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity. But other continents are also moving towards each other. The Pacific Ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year, which will ultimately cause America to collide with Eurasia, while Australia is also moving towards Asia by 2.8 inches (7cm) a year and will join Amasia. \u2018It would take at least tens of millions more years - perhaps several hundred million years - before the new supercontinent is fully formed,\u2019 Dr Li told the SMH. Using new techniques - namely high-resolution seismic tomography, geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are able to track these changes in unprecedented ways. For example, they can compare them to previous supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea, which formed one billion and 300 million years ago respectively. \u2018These advances have allowed us to link present-day plate tectonics on Earth's surface to dynamic processes deep in the mantle - and to link these to ancient records of geology,\u2019 Dr Li said. Many of Earth's land masses are continuing to move into each other. The Pacific Ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year, which will ultimately cause America to collide with Eurasia, while Australia is also moving towards Asia by 2.8 inches (7cm) a year and will join Amasia . This map shows how Nepal is situated near the border of India and Asia, where two tectonic plates are moving into one another. The Indian plate is continuing to move North at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity, which in turn can lead to tremors and devastating earthquakes . The UN says 8 million people have been affected by the weekend earthquake in Nepal that killed nearly 4,400 people and 1.4 million people are in need of food assistance. Jamie McGoldrick, UN resident coordinator in Kathmandu, told reporters that of those affected two million people are in the 11 worst-hit districts. The challenge of supplying to small villages at high altitudes and in rough terrain \"is quite significant, he said. After flying by helicopter over Dhulikhel town, on the north side of the Kathmandu valley, he estimated about 40% of the houses were damaged, but destruction was erratic. Where exactly this supercontinent will form, however, has been the cause of some debate. While some had suspected it would be centered around Africa, a study by Yale University in 2012 suggested that the North Pole would actually be the centre point. North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing, while Asia will join the Americas, according to the study. They said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years. The most recent supercontinent, Pangea (which is Greek for \u2018All Lands\u2019), formed about 300 million years ago with Africa at its centre. It began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the Atlantic Ocean about 100 million years later. Researchers said the earthquake in Nepal highlighted how dangerous shifting tectonic plates can be. Pictured, Nepalese people walk among the debris of houses after the quake in Bhaktapur. The death toll in Nepal following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake is continuing to rise and could hit 10,000 . This series of graphics shows how our land masses have separated from Pangaea into the distinct continents we have today.\u00a0Using new techniques - namely high-resolution seismic tomography, geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are tracking the changes in better detail . Researchers believe Pangea is the third or fourth supercontinent in Earth\u2019s history. Its immediate predecessors were Rodinia - which formed around 1 billion years ago - and Nuna, which formed 1.8 billion years ago. The idea of continental drift was introduced by German scientist Alfred Wegener in 1912 to explain how the shape of Earth\u2019s countries looked suspiciously like jigsaw pieces that would fit together. The Earth\u2019s surface is formed from seven major and several minor tectonic plates that wander around at speeds varying from a few millimetres to two centimetres a year, the same pace that a human nail grows. It\u2019s the friction caused by plates grinding against each other that causes earthquakes.",

And Leonardo DiCaprio is planning to improve the ecosystem of an entire island in his latest crusade as an environmental activist. The 40-year-old actor is launching a project that will transform a small island off the coast of Belize into an eco-resort and conservation area. According to a Friday report from the New York Times, the Wolf Of Wall Street star, along with a partner, purchased the 104-acre Blackadore Caye nearly a decade ago for $1.75 million. But he recently  teamed up with Paul Scialla, the chief executive of New York development firm Delos, to create the eco-conscious resort, with plans to open in 2018. 'It was like heaven on earth,' DiCaprio told the New York Times of his visit to the island in 2005. 'And almost immediately, I found this opportunity to purchase an island there.' Scroll down for video . Environmental mission: Leonardo DiCaprio\u00a0bought Blackadore Caye, an unpopulated, private 104-acre Belizean island, in 2005 for $1.75 million, and now plans to build a luxury eco-resort there. Pictured here is an artists impression of a private villa on the island . 'It will change the world':\u00a0The resort will have villas on a platform over the water, as well as artificial reefs with 'fish shelters' and other features that hope to rehabilitate the ailing area. It is set to open in 2018 . Ambitious:\u00a0Renderings of the project show an arc-shaped platform with villas and artificial reefs and fish shelters underneath . The ambitious project, which they will be calling 'Blackadore Caye, a Restorative Island,' will be much like many other luxury resorts and include sprawling villas, infinity pools and beautiful views. But not only will the island revitalize its visitors, but also help restore the land itself, as it has endured deterioration from over-fishing, deforestation and an eroding coastline. The aim of DiCaprio and his partners is to rehabilitate the ecosystem of the area. Renderings of the ambitious project show an arc-shaped platform with villas over the water with artificial reefs and fish shelters underneath. The daily also reports that other features will include a nursery that will grow indigenous marine grass to support a manatee conservation area and mangrove trees replanted to replace invasive species. 'The main focus is to do something that will change the world,' said the Titanic actor. 'I couldn\u2019t have gone to Belize and built on an island and done something like this, if it weren\u2019t for the idea that it could be groundbreaking in the environmental movement.' Activist: DiCaprio, who earned a reported $25 million pay packet for The Wolf Of Wall Street, is known for working on environmental causes . The Times reports that the plan is to\u00a0build 68 resort villas and 48 private house. Some will are expected to be sold privately, and cost between $5 million and $15 million each, while the others will be available to guests. Nearby luxury resorts cost about $2,000-a-night. The project will also be monitored by a talented team of scientists, designers and engineers who along with landscape architects will closely monitor the resort's impact on the island's\u00a0environment. After a scuba diving trip in Belize back in 2005, DiCaprio bought the Blackadore Caye for $1.75million with Jeff Gram, who owns Cayo Espanto Island Resort, which is a luxury vacation spot nearby. Private island: The nearest town to Blackadore Caye is San Pedro, which is a 15 minute boat ride away. The tiny Blackadore Caye is currently unpopulated . Big plans: Blackadore Caye (pictured) is a 104-acre island in the Caribbean Sea owned by DiCaprio and a business partner. The two plan to work with scientists and a NYC design firm to develop a resort that will 'rehabilitate' the area, which is suffering . Tropical: DiCaprio hopes the island, when completed, will not only revitalize its visitors, but also help restore the land itself, as it has endured deterioration from over-fishing, deforestation and an eroding coastline. The Blood Diamond actor previously had an agreement with Four Seasons Hotels but the deal ultimately fell through, according to the publication. No doubt the ecotourism venture is right up DiCaprio's alley as the project's aim will certainly follow resorts before it that minimizes negative impact on a location and seeks to preserve natural resources. The actor is currently filming an adventure drama, The Revenant, alongside Tom Hardy. 'Paradise': The closest port to DiCaprio's island is the town of San Pedro,\u00a0on the southern part of the island of Ambergris Caye in Belize . Tourism: San Pedro is a known vacation spot in Belize. Vistors would take a 15-minute boat ride from here to DiCaprio's resort .",

Speaking from her home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, yesterday, she said their three children were aware he was dating Miss West. 'He left me for a girl in the [Army] Cadets,' Mrs Draper said. 'He then was seeing another girl who he met in the Cadets, who he was with for around ten years.' It was this relationship, not his marriage, that Major Draper ended before spending time with Miss West. His ex-wife added: 'He's gone out with two other girls from the Cadets and one was 20 years younger.' Aimee West, 24, was devastated when her husband-to-be Fusilier Rigby (pictured) was hacked to death in the street in Woolwich, south east London, two years ago . According to reports, Miss West and Major Draper have been on several dates in the past few months. The 51-year-old, a decorated member of the Middlesex and North West Army Cadet Force, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I like to see Aimee. We are very good friends and we enjoy each other's company.' A source told the paper it was 'common knowledge they're dating', adding: 'If anyone deserves to be happy, it's Aimee. She's had a dreadful time. 'She'll never forget Lee \u2013 he was so important to her \u2013 but everyone wants her to be happy. Paul is a lot older than Aimee but he's been there for her since Lee died.' Major Draper separated from his latest partner, Priscilla, last November. He and Miss West have since attended a number of Cadet functions together and last month he comforted her at a St Paul's Cathedral service to honour fallen soldiers in Afghanistan. Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales in August 2012 and a year later they were engaged. Pictured from left, Aimee West, Lee Rigby's sister Sara McClure and his mother Lyn Rigby at the Old Bailey . Remembering him last year, she said: 'As soon as he turned up, everyone knew he was there because he was energetic and fast-paced, and like nobody else I ever met.' Miss West was 3,500 miles away at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan when she learned her fiance had been killed in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks. British-born Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car as he was walking towards the barracks in a Help For Heroes hoodie, before hacking him to death with knives. They claimed the heinous act on May 22, 2013, was revenge for the killing of Muslims by British armed forces. They were both jailed for life. After the sentencing, Miss West said: 'I hope that this is the last we will hear from them both, so that I can focus on rebuilding my life and keeping Lee's memory alive.' Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales and became engaged in 2013 . Following Fusilier Rigby's death, Miss West quit the Army and has gone back to university, where she is studying to be a lawyer. She set up the Lee Rigby Fund as part of the Soldiers' Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association \u2013 and is set to run the London Marathon to raise money for the charity later this month. Last November, she spoke of her daily battle to block thoughts about the two Islamic extremists who murdered her fiance. In an interview, she said: 'I've mentally detached myself to be able to cope.' Miss West was not available for comment at her home in Feltham, west London, yesterday.

        "article": "Deborah Fuller has been banned from keeping animals after she dragged her dog behind her car, causing wounds as she drove at 30mph . A dog breeder and exhibitor who dragged her pet behind her car at a speed of 30mph and failed to get painful wounds to its paws and chest treated, has been banned from keeping animals and had her dogs confiscated. Deborah Fuller, 56, dragged her dog Tango for 400 metres behind her car as she drove along\u00a0the B1066 near Long Melford, Essex. The Rhodesian ridgeback was left with injuries to all four paws as well as grazing to his chest and a deep wound on his elbow. He is believed to have somehow escaped from the boot of her car and was dragged along the single carriageway because his lead was attached to the vehicle's tailgate. Fuller, of\u00a0Lawford, Essex, denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal\u00a0by not taking it to the vets and failing to take steps to safely secure a dog within a vehicle, but was convicted following a hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Fuller has also been banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated. Chairman of the bench Anthony Ealden said if Tango had been taken to the vet earlier 'unnecessary suffering' could have been avoided. He said: 'We believe for whatever reason, known only to yourself, you had no intention of getting veterinary treatment as a matter of urgency. 'We do not accept your reason for delaying treatment as reasonable.' The incident took place on June 11, 2014, when the dog was seen being dragged along the B1006 behind the car. Tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get Fuller, who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder and exhibitor, to stop her car. She didn't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the RSPCA, the court heard. Tango was later found by inspectors  in an outbuilding at Fuller's home with bandages on his paws. He was taken to a vet and given treatment for his injuries, which took eight weeks. Tango was left with considerable injuries to his paws and stomach, as well as a deep elbow wound . Tango, a Rhodesian ridgeback, pictured before being injured by being dragged along the road . Fuller claimed she had not been aware the rear hatch of her car had opened and claimed she had given the one-year-old dog first aid, and had already arranged for him to go to the vet when police turned up. Mike Fullerton, defending Fuller, said: \u00a0'When Deborah Fuller was being restrained she asked why she was not allowed to take the dog to the vet.' RSPCA inspector Sam Garvey said after the sentencing: 'Eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph. 'This must have been horrific for poor Tango. So painful, and so distressing. 'It is hard to say what caused Tango to be dragged behind a moving car in this way, but by the time we found him, seven hours later, he was urgently in need of vet treatment. The animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns, suffered when he was dragged along the road . Judges ruled that the dog's suffering could have been avoided if Fuller had taken him to the vets earlier . 'He had injuries to the pads of all four feet, causing the black layer of skin to be removed. He also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area. 'It took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort.' Fuller was also ordered to\u00a0pay \u00a33,000 costs, given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am.\u00a0Tango was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care. The court also allowed confiscation of all the animals owned by Fuller, which are currently in RSPCA care. Tango was removed from Fuller, along with more than 40 other dogs that were at her Essex home . Fuller and her partner Phil Sheldrake, 59, previously pleaded guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the dogs' needs at Colchester Magistrates Court in June. Earlier this month the case was thrown out after the High Court ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their Essex home. Tendring District Council had been granted a warrant to investigate 'nuisance' at the house, following complaints about noise and dog faeces. The council joined forces with the RSPCA and seized 44 dogs from the house, with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated. However the trial was halted when district judge Kenneth Sheraton\u00a0said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant.",

        "article": "They have invited us into their kitchens and proudly shown off their families. But most of us are fed up with hearing about the wives and children of the party leaders, it seems. For 71 per cent of voters say they are choosing politicians and have no need to know about their spouses or offspring, a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News reveals. Only a quarter say it is important to know about leaders\u2019 domestic lives. Scroll down for video . Voters don't feel the need to know about politician's wives, a poll has found. Above: Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez were seen in their \u00a31.5million Putney home in an ITV interview broadcast last night . Only 25 per cent of voters believe it is\u00a0important to get to know party leaders\u2019 families, the new ComRes poll shows. The party leaders have made their wives more prominent in this election campaign than ever before . The findings may come as a shock to Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who have all invited the TV cameras into their homes and given their wives prominent campaign roles. Yesterday Mr Clegg became the latest to show off his kitchen, only to have it criticised for being mismatched and dated. It follows an interview with Mr Miliband and his wife Justine in one of their two kitchens and footage of the Camerons in the kitchen in Downing Street and in their Witney home. In the ITV interview broadcast last night, Mr Clegg and his Spanish wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez were seen in their \u00a31.5million Putney home, sipping white wine while, in the background, a paella was cooking on the hob. However, one interior designer said the Clegg kitchen was \u2018middle of the road\u2019, too much a mix of city and country \u2013 and in need of refreshing. In the interview, Mr Clegg revealed what many have long suspected, that in key decisions his wife wears the trousers. The poll found that women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians\u2019 spouses and families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. Above: Ed Miliband is supported by wife Justine during the campaign . The ComRes poll shows Conservative voters are the most likely to think it is important to get to know the wives and children of the party leaders \u2013 32 per cent, compared with 25 per cent of Labour voters. Labour would lower the voting age to 16, the party confirmed yesterday as Ed Miliband launched its education manifesto. The move \u2013 the first change in the voting age since 1969 \u2013 would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Lib Dems. But polls show that the public, including most 16-year-olds, do not support the idea. It is also opposed by the Conservatives. David Cameron said this year he was willing to hold a Commons vote on the issue, but did not support the move. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year. He warned the move would \u2018politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school\u2019. Women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians\u2019 families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. This follows a campaign that has seen the wives play unprecedented high-profile roles. Mrs Cameron has accompanied her husband on a series of election visits. She has even made a solo visit to the seat of Rochester and Strood, in Kent, where the Tories are seeking to dislodge Ukip defector Mark Reckless. Justine Miliband has given a national newspaper interview while Mr Clegg\u2019s wife has also taken part in campaign visits. A separate poll found that Mrs Cameron is twice as popular as other leaders\u2019 wives. The YouGov survey found that 54 per cent of voters though Mrs Cameron was the best election asset, with 26 per cent for Mrs Miliband and 20 per cent supporting Miss Gonzalez Durantez. The Prime Minister\u2019s wife scored well with men and women alike, as well as voters who have backed other parties. Some 90 per cent of Tory supporters chose Mrs Cameron, compared with 82 per cent of Lib Dem supporters who opted for Mrs Clegg. Only 61 per cent of Labour supporters backed Mrs Miliband.",

'Chris and I are on the same page and we definitely plan to get married in the near future,' the singer recently told The Mail on Sunday in her first interview about her famous boyfriend. 'Some people call it a pre-engagement. It's all about timing \u2013 at the moment we're both so busy with work. Pre-engaged: Camilla was joined by her England rugby captain boyfriend Chris Robshaw but her dress was the focus of attention . 'I even had to spend Valentine's Day outside in the cold sandwiched between hordes of angry men as I cheered Chris on during his game.'

So far, her  6ft 2in boyfriend has been notably reticent when friends have quizzed him on the subject. But Camilla appears undeterred. 'It's tricky now as I'm currently locked away in the studio recording my third album and Chris is obviously incredibly busy and focused on his rugby and the Six Nations. 'But he gets back from England camp in April and the Six Nations boys have some time off in May and weekends off in June, so we'll have more time to ourselves then,' she added.

The singer will share the bill with names including Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, Downton Abbey's Laura Carmichael, Dame Judi Dench, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pixie Lott and Russell Tovey. A beauty: She styled her blonde hair to one side, while wearing dramatic red lipstick and taupe eyewear to give the look a perfect flourish . Scherzinger, nominated for best supporting actress in a musical for her role as Grizabella in Cats, will perform Memory from the hit show. There will be huge cheers if there is a win for 89-year-old Angela Lansbury, up for best supporting actress for playing scatterbrained psychic Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit.

        "article": "A nine-year-old girl is pregnant after suffering horrific sexual abuse at the hands of Isis militants in northern Iraq, aid workers report. The Yazidi girl has recently been released after nearly a year as a prisoner in the Islamic State, where women and young girls from the religious minority are known to be kept as 'sex slaves'. Earlier this week, more than 200 Yazidi women, children and elderly were released near Kirkuk, northern Iraq after being taken by Isis militants last June. Scroll down for video . Released: An elderly Yazidi man is being cared for by peshmerga troops while a young girl cries as she is being offered water by a Kurdish soldier after their release near Kirkuk, northern Iraq . Fear: The 216 prisoners, including 40 children, believed they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto minibuses that drove them to a handover southwest of Kirkuk . Relief: A newly released Yazidi woman reacts upon her arrival in the village of Himera, southwest of Kirkuk, after she and hundreds of other Yazidis had been held captive since last summer . Around 40,000 people were kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. Hundreds have been able to return, either by fleeing or being set free by ISIS, and the nine-year-old is among them. According to aid workers, she was 'sexually abused by no fewer than ten men', while in captivity inside the self-proclaimed caliphate. 'Most of them were front-line fighters or suicide bombers who are given girls as a reward,'\u00a0Yousif Daoud, a Canadian-based aid worker told the Toronto Star. 'This girl is so young she could die if she delivers a baby,' he added. 'Even a caesarian section is dangerous. The abuse she has suffered left her mentally and physically traumatized.' Free at last: A mother hugs here young child in celebration at being released. The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care . Yazidi families embrace after ISIS let them go. About 40 children were among those released . The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority . The nine-year-old was taken to Germany by a Kurdish charity earlier this week, where she is receiving medical care, the newspaper reported. This comes after the release of 216 Yazidi prisoners who had been held captive since last summer when ISIS militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. The freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions. The Yazidis, made up of women, children and the elderly, are said to be in poor health and bearing signs of abuse and neglect. General Hiwa Abdullah, a peshmerga commander in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said that about 40 children are among those released, some of whom were too exhausted and disoriented to speak. No reason was given for the release of the prisoners, which took place in Himera just southwest of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad. Emotional scenes: Once the Yazidi prisoners, made up of women, children and the elderly, realised they were not being executed but freed, many broke down by the roadside . Newly released members of the Yazidi minority, including one girl with an injured leg, wait for medical help after being set free by ISIS . Saved: An officer from the Kurdish forces carries an elderly Yazidi woman at the checkpoint in near Kirkuk . The freed Yazidis were taken away by ambulances and buses to receive treatment and care. One elderly woman said she had been captured by the insurgents last August when they overpowered Kurdish forces in the Sinjar area and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population, killing hundreds and taking thousands captive. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had told her son and two young daughters to run away as the militants closed in, but stayed behind herself because she was unwell and did not want to slow them down. 'I had lost hope of seeing my children again, but today it has happened,' she said as they embraced her and wept. It was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the Yazidis, whom they consider devil-worshippers, but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery . Iraqi Yazidis are seen at the entrance of a checkpoint in Kirkuk after their release by the Islamic State militants near Kirkuk, northern Iraq . The 216 prisoners have been held captive in the Islamic State since last summer when militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq . Some of the Yazidis said they had been held in the Islamic State stronghold of Tel Afar most of the time, but in the days leading up to their release, they were moved from one town to another in Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate. Yazidi community leaders were there to receive them and an ambulance was on standby. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery. The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority. The Yazidis are an ancient, predominantly Kurdish people who follow their own religion derived from Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.",

But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio. \u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it.

Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019. If you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. \u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros. And then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special. Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle . Come Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story. Although it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion. This was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end! Former Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful . From the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be. It was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time. Yet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you. Much of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport .",

        "article": "As England\u2019s supporters settled in for a few pints at the Huntsman pub in the centre of Turin on Tuesday afternoon, a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest anti-IRA song. \u2018**** the IRA,\u2019 it goes \u2014 and it really does go on, and on and on. Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday . Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June\u2019s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: \u2018Where were you in World War Two,\u2019 or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England\u2019s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton\u2019s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned . In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let\u2019s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans\u2019 behaviour. \u2018We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,\u2019 he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour . The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA\u2019s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of \u2018a section of the England support\u2019. It read: \u2018We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.\u2019 The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin\u00a0- there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the \u2018two caps for Wembley\u2019 loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the \u2018caps\u2019, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn\u2019t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.",

The midfielder has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee ligament injury, but Tottenham are weighing up a bid for the 25-year-old, who has two years left on his \u00a330,000-a-week contract, . Interest from Arsenal was rejected by Southampton last summer, but Koeman says the upcoming transfer window will be more testing for a player with ambitions to play in the Champions League. Morgan Schneiderlin may have played his last game for Southampton after damaging knee ligaments . The \u00a0French midfielder has been linked with a move to Arsenal and Tottenham this summer . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has admitted that Schneiderlin may leave the club this summer . The Southampton boss said: \u2018It\u2019s more difficult (than last year), I understand because I got the possibility as a player to change team and go to a big team, Barcelona, from Holland. \u2018We try to keep him for longer, we do everything, but there is a \u201cstop\u201d where we can\u2019t do more and then it\u2019s all about the decision of the player. \u2018I don\u2019t know (if he\u2019s played his last game), or about interest or about bids. We would like to keep everybody but sometimes it\u2019s difficult. There aren\u2019t any serious bids for the player. He is happy but it\u2019s up to him.\u2019 While Koeman says that Schneiderlin's season is over, the player himself has not given up on making it back before the end of May. He tweeted: 'Sad about my injury .. I am not giving up on coming back before the end of the season !Thanks to everyone for their support !' Koeman also conceded that he may be forced to consider selling Nathaniel Clyne if the England right back does not sign a new contract within the next 10 days. Manchester United have shown interest in Clyne, who is entering the last year of his deal, and despite the offer to make him one of Saints\u2019 best-paid players, he is stalling on signing. \u2018The club is offering the maximum we can,\u2019 Koeman said. \u2018In football if you go into your last season of a contract, we don\u2019t like that.\u2019 Koeman also conceded that he may have to consider selling Nathaniel Clyne if he does not sign a new contract .",

        "article": "(CNN)Charlotte Dujardin says she is \"living the dream\" as she cements her status as a dressage legend. Dujardin and Valegro won their their second consecutive Reem Acra FEI World Cup Dressage title in Las Vegas at the weekend -- a trophy to sit alongside Olympic gold and the world and European titles. While their score of 94.196 narrowly missed their own world record in the sport, it was still a full 10 percentage points clear of any rival inside the Thomas & Mack Arena. Dutchman Edward Gal and Glock's Undercover were second with 84.696, ahead of Germany's Jessica von Bredow-Werndl and Unee BB in third with 80.464. \"Valegro just loves his job,\" said Dujardin. \"I don't have to force him to do anything, I just sit there and steer and off I go. There's no sweating, no pushing, no pulling. He knows his job and it's just fantastic\" added Dujardin, who couldn't stop smiling as she was pictured next to an Elvis impersonator after her win. Not everyone finds World Cup success quite that relaxing. Switzerland's Steve Guerdat may be the London Olympic champion, but his Longines FEI World Cup jumping victory in Vegas came at the 10th attempt. Guerdat and Albfuehren's Paille had the last fence down and narrowly avoided a time fault that would have denied them the outright win. \"I don't really want to think about it,\" he joked. \"Coming to the last I knew the time was tight. \"I just went as fast as I could to the finish line, but unfortunately there was a big fence in the way.\" He added: \"I've been three times on the podium, twice in the jump-off and always finished in the top 10. I always wanted to win this.\" The World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious equestrian titles, but the weekend's events in Las Vegas were notable for the success of younger riders. American dressage rider Laura Graves, a 27-year-old who burst onto the international scene with fifth place at last year's World Equestrian Games, improved to fourth in Vegas. Her performance was outdone by Irish showjumper Bertram Allen, who took bronze on Sunday at the age of 19. The teenager is likely to rise through the ranks of the world's top 10 following that performance, while gaining precious Olympic qualification points. Allen and Molly Malone finished behind French rider Penelope Leprevost, on board Vagabond de la Pomme, who took silver.",

Jackson County Chief Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson told 'monster' James Tingley of Michigan 'the only money we should waste on you is the cost of a bullet.' Wilson continued by saying he thinks locking Tingley up for the next 25 to 50 years in prison 'is worth every penny.' Scroll down for video . Molested seven chuldren: James Tingley watches during his sentencing of 25 to 50 years in prison on criminal sexual conduct charges on Thui . 'Children will be a lot safer. They won't have to go through the victimization that the victims went through here,' Wilson told Tingley. 'Mr. Tingley, basically you are a monster who has destroyed the innocence of numerous children.' Mlive reports that James Tingley was convicted on March 3 of heinous sex crimes against two girls over a six year period. His crimes span a period of 50 years. During Tingley's hearing, Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Walker told the court that police know of at least five other girls Tingley abused but they believe there may be more. 'The defendant, he has called himself \"Jim\", He has called himself \"Uncle Jim\" but I would call him a monster and a pedophile,' Walker said. Repeat offender: James Tingley, pictured on Thursday in court, \u00a0sexually abused at least seven girls, investigators said . 'The defendant has stolen the souls, or parts of the souls, of these children. He's used them to meet all of his sexual needs. ... He's been violent with them, with others he's treated them as a girlfriend and he's wanted them to be his wife. ... It's disgusting,' walker added. Timgley's attorney Eric White told the court that Tingley still claims he is innocent. White added that Tingley's health is declining and that it's unlikely he'll live past his first parole date which is when he turns 96. Tingley did not wish to say anything to the court. Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka said he thought Tingley received a fair sentence for his cruel actions. 'Certainly when it comes to cases of criminal sexual conduct with minors we appreciate the judge handing out a stiff sentence and ultimately we want to protect our kids,' Jarzynka said. Mlive reports that Tingley's perverted accomplice Randy Stevens, 45, was also convicted of sexual misconduct by a separate jury for 'allowing Tingley to carry out a number of sexual assaults.' This is not the first time Stevens has been accused of aiding in child abuse. Stevens, a father of 14,  pleaded guilty to second-degree child abuse and a judge sentenced him six to 10 years in prison last year. Mlive reports that last year's conviction was related to Stevens letting his children visit another sex offender, Geoffrey Friant, who is now serving 30 to 80 years behind bars. Stevens will be sentenced on April 16. Both he and his wife, Bobbi Jo Stevens, have lost their parental rights to their children.",

Bolt visited a small gym in Brazil on Thursday and spoke of his plans for the Rio Olympics . Bolt made the time to pose for pictures alongside his many supporters in Brazil . Bolt is in Rio to promote an event over the weekend, and made a 30-minute visit to the Mangueira sports complex. Many couldn't believe it when they were told Bolt - the world's fastest man - was dropping by a slum that's visible from Rio's famous Maracana stadium. Leaving the basketball court, Bolt posed for selfies, took his own video and even ran a 20-metre race on the track with several young girls. A few kids at the complex's small football field climbed a chain link fence to have a look. Bolt seemed to enjoy himself, raised his arms a few times in mock gestures of triumph and took time to look at the selfies of others. 'It was really great,' said Camile Vitoria Santana Melo, a 12-year-old who ran alongside Bolt. 'I wasn't expecting it. I came here today to practice. I was very happy, very excited when I saw him.' Bolt (centre) jogged a 20-metre track with some youngsters who had been training there . Jamaican sprinter Bolt has admitted that the 2016 Olympic games in Rio will be his last . There are more than 1,000 favelas in Rio. Many are lawless tin and cinderblock settlements dug in atop the city's hills, home to Rio's poor and much of its crime.

        "article": "Children may be drawn to greasy fries and burgers, but fatty foods can reduce the speed at which their brains work, according to a new study. It found that children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory. Children who ate the fatty diet performed worse when they were given a task-switching game to complete, the researchers said. A new study has found that\u00a0children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory. A stock image is pictured . For the study, scientists at the University of Illinois recruited 150 children aged between seven and 10 and gave them a game which involved learning a pattern between a set of shapes and colours. The game was designed to test cognitive flexibility, which is our ability to shift attention, select information and alter our response strategy to fit the changing demands of a task. Their performance was then compared with a food diary that the children had completed with the help of their parents, and which was overseen by a dietician. 'Children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility,' the study says. A stock image of neurons is shown . Researchers at Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences claim that eating fatty food for just five days can change the body's metaboilsm for the worse. This is because it disrupts the way muscles break down sugar in the blood and potentially lead to long-term problems such as weight gain, obsesity and other health problems. 'Most people think they can indulge in high-fat foods for a few days and get away with it,' said Matt Hulver, an associate professor at the college. 'But all it takes is five days for your body's muscle to start to protest. 'This research shows that our bodies can respond dramatically to changes in diet in a shorter time frame than we have previously thought. Students were given a diet containing 55 per cent fat and after five days muscle samples were collected to see how they metablised sugar. Dr Hulver and his team found that after five days of eating lots of fat, the muscles' ability to oxidise glucose was disrupted, meaning that it wasn't broken down into energy as easily. Writing in the journal Appetite, the researchers said: \u2018Cognitive flexibility is important because it comprises the ability to switch perspectives in daily life \u2013 for example, viewing a problem from the point of view of others or from a different direction, and involves being flexible enough to adjust to changing demands or priorities. \u2018Following adjustment of confounding variables - age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, VO2max (the rate at which the body can use oxygen during exercise) and BMI, children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility. \u2018Further, increasing saturated fat intake and dietary cholesterol were correlated with greater switch costs (such as the difference in performance and accuracy between repeating a task and switching a task), reflecting impaired ability to maintain multiple task sets in working memory and poorer efficiency of cognitive control processes involved in task switching. \u2018These data are among the first to indicate that children consuming diets higher in saturated fats and cholesterol exhibit compromised ability to flexibly modulate their cognitive operations, particularly when faced with greater cognitive challenge.\u2019 Previous studies have found that aerobic fitness and obesity can also affect a child\u2019s cognitive flexibility.",

        "article": "(CNN)The Coxes can rest more comfortably living in Georgia now that their 5-year-old daughter can get the marijuana extract she needs. \"This means the world to us,\" said Haleigh Cox's mother, Janea Cox. Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill Thursday that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain \"medication-resistant epilepsies,\" while creating an infrastructure, registration process and research program for the drug. (THC is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana.) The bill is dubbed Haleigh's Hope Act. Haleigh, who has been the face of the bill, was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them weren't making life better for the little girl. Janea Cox said in a March 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to Colorado, where medical marijuana is legal, in hopes of saving her life. \"She was maxed out,\" Cox said. \"She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications.\" 10 diseases marijuana could affect . Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in Georgia. So a week after hearing a doctor's diagnosis that Haleigh might not live another three months, she and Haleigh packed up and moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night. \"Every time she smiled I knew we did the right thing, because we hadn't seen her smile in three years,\" Cox said. \"Now she's thriving, she's healthy, she's happy, and they're absolutely shocked at the difference. So I think we've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil.\" Deal is apparently one of those believers, signing HB1 on Thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions. The bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders, but it also will allow patients to receive in-state treatment. To obtain a license in Georgia, you will need to have a specific covered condition, such as acute seizures. \"For the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain, the wait is finally over,\" Deal said Thursday. \"... Now, Georgia children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much-needed care.\" For Cox, it's a blessing \"to be able to come back home, and with Haleigh's medicine, it's done wonders for her -- going from 200-plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling, happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she's in there.\" She added, \"Colorado has been good to us, but Georgia's home. Georgia's definitely home.\" With medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states, doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments. While Georgia's law is specific to a handful of conditions, medical marijuana laws in states such as California permit marijuana use for an array of ailments. But as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" To backers of reform, it presents a Catch-22: Marijuana is restricted, in large part, because there is scant research to support medical uses, yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.",

        "article": "The final Discworld novel written by Sir Terry Pratchett before he died last month at the age of 66 will be released later this year, his publishers have said. The book will be called The Shepherd's Crown and will feature Tiffany Aching, a witch-in-training who has featured in four of Sir Terry's books to date, first appearing in The Wee Free Men in 2003. The novel, which is based in the fictional realm of Discworld - a flat disc balanced on the back of four elephants and a giant turtle roaming through space - will go on sale in September. Scroll down for video . The final book written by Sir Terry Pratchett, The Shepherd's Crown, which will be set in the Discworld universe and feature witch Tiffany Aching, will be released this September, his publishers have said . Tom Weldon, from publishers Penguin Random House, said: 'It is a huge privilege to be publishing Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s final Discworld novel, The Shepherd\u2019s Crown. 'Terry\u2019s writing is loved and respected the world over and this publication will be an incredibly important and special event for us all at Penguin Random House, and for fans and readers everywhere.' Sir Terry published his fist Discworld novel, The Colour Of Magic, in 1983 and went on to sell 85million books worldwide, with his work being translated into 37 languages. Before that he had been a journalist, writing for the Bucks Free Press, the Western Daily Press and finally the Bath Chronicle. The character of Tiffany, who forms one of several side-plots in the 40 Discoworld novels, first appeared in The Wee Free Men (left) in 2003, and went on to feature in another three books . A Hat Full Of Sky, Wintersmith, and I Shall Wear Midnight saw Tiffany grow to be 16 and become a powerful witch. The plot of the final book is unknown, but the shepherd in the title could refer to her grandmother . He became a press officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, with responsibility for three nuclear power stations, in 1980. 1948: Born to David and Eileen Pratchett in Beconsfield, Buckinghamshire . 1965: Left school to become a reporter for the Bucks Free Press . 1968: Married wife Lyn. Daughter Rhianna is born eight years later . 1971: Published his first book, The Carpet People, which received good reviews but generated only modest sales . 1980: Left journalism to work in PR for the Central Electricity Generating Board . 1983: Published the first book of the Discworld series, The Colour Of Magic, which sold out during its first day . 1998: Awarded an OBE at Buckingham Palace for 'services to literature' 2007: Diagnosed with rare form of early-onset Alzheimer's after car accident. Becomes a right to die campaigner . 2009: Knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace . 2012: He gives an interview stating that, while his health is better than expected, his condition is catching up with him. By this point he is thought to be writing by dictation . 2014: Sir Terry finishes his final book, The Shepherd's Crown, which will be published this September . 2015: Sir Terry dies at his home in Wiltshire. His death is announced by his daughter on Twitter . He was first published in 1971 with novel\u00a0The Carpet People, but his career as a writer did not truly take off until The Colour of Magic was printed. In total Sir Terry published 70 novels, 40 of which were set in Discworld, blending together elements of fantasy, philosophy and real-world politics, while managing to satirise all three. The character of Tiffany Aching first appeared in 2003. Then aged just nine, she began her training as a witch, and was awarded an imaginary invisible hat to boost her confidence. Over the course of another three books, A Hat Full Of Sky, Wintersmith, and I Shall Wear Midnight, Tiffany turned 16, growing in power and gaining abilities along the way. While the plot of the final Discworld book has not yet been revealed, the shepherd of the book's title could be a reference to Tiffany's grandmother,\u00a0Sarah Aching, who herded sheep. Sir Terry\u00a0was born in 1948, the only child of a working-class couple - his father was a mechanic - and brought up in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Adventurous, and keen on learning by doing, he disliked school and had to be bribed by his parents into reading books. While he eventually became hooked on fiction, that never translated into a love of the classroom and he left as soon as he was able in order to become a reporter. As his literary career took off he won a host of prizes and was handed a total of nine honorary doctorates, before being awarded an OBE in 1998, and was finally knighted in 2009 'for services to literature'. Asked about his success at the time, he said: 'Most writers don\u2019t make much money, they only happen to make some if they\u2019re standing in the station when the gravy train comes in. Sir Terry wrote 70 novels, 40 of which were set in Discworld - a flat planet carried through space on the back of four elephants and a giant turtle - selling 85million copies (pictured after being given an OBE in 1998) 'I thought I was lucky to make some money, then lucky to make a living, then lucky to be a millionaire.' However, in 2007, he was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy [PCA], a form of early-onset Alzheimer's. Sir Terry, who was knighted in 2009 (pictured), suffered from a form of early-onset Alzheimer's, and was a right to die campaigner . The first hint that he was not well came as he drove home after watching his father, David, die from pancreatic cancer, when he misjudged a lane and scraped his car along a wall. As he succumbed to the disease he lost everyday skills such as touch-typing, but simply took to dictation software to write his books instead, insisting it made him even more eloquent. He also refused to become self-pitying. He rarely referred to his illness by name, instead preferring to call it 'the embuggerance' He even turned his illness to public campaigning, speaking tirelessly and eloquently in favour of people's the right to die in the manner of their choosing. Sir Terry passed away on March 12 'with his cat sleeping on his bed surrounded by his family' at his home in Wiltshire. His death was announced on Twitter by his daughter, Rhianna, who used his account to write:\u00a0'AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.' 'Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night. The End.' The character of Death, one of the most beloved in the Discworld series, always speaks in capitals. Since Sir Terry's death, mourning fans have donated more than \u00a340,000 to The Research Institute For The Care Of Older People, a charity for which he campaigned.",

        "article": "A blind man was left 'completely embarrassed and humiliated' after staff at his local Post Office refused him entry with his guide dog. Craig Roberts, 36, from Chadderton, Manchester, walked into his town's Post Office and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. Even when Mr Roberts explained his two-year-old Golden Labrador Retriever Cross was a guide dog, the employee allegedly still insisted he should be left outside. Scroll down for video . Humiliated: Craig Roberts, 36, was told by Post Office staff in Chadderton, Manchester, that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. He said he was left feeling 'angry and shocked' Mr Roberts said: 'I was left feeling so angry and shocked. It is unacceptable that I should be made to feel like I had done something wrong by going to the Post Office with my guide dog. In this day and age there should be more awareness than that.' He added: 'Luckily a couple of customers heard him and said he wasn't allowed to do it because I had a guide dog and that he would have to let me in. He was told a few times and wasn't happy about it.' Mr Roberts, who had gone to the Post Office to top up his electric meter with his payment card, was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff. He said: 'He did serve me in the end. I think he only served me because the other customers interjected. You could tell they were angry and a couple shouted \"you can't do that, he has a guide dog\".' The Post Office in Chadderton, Manchester, where Mr Roberts was told he had to leave his guide dog outside . Mr Roberts was born with glaucoma, a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye, but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight. He now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he can't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The 36-year-old, who lives alone, said: 'I find it difficult doing everyday tasks at home as it is. Making a meal is tricky as I have to make sure it is cooked and cleaning is quite hard because I can't see dust and dirt. Under the Equality Act 2010, people with disabilities have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers also have to make 'reasonable adjustments' for guide dog and assistance dog owners which might mean offering extra help, and this includes allowing guide dogs and assistance dogs into all public places with their owners. 'It takes quite a lot to go out to the shops as it is and so to be made to feel that I can't even go to the Post Office to simply pay a bill is ridiculous.' Mr Roberts said he has 'never experienced anything like this before' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular Post Office has happened. He added: 'This incident has really knocked my confidence and made me think if I can't take Bruce to the Post Office, will this happened again at the shops or a caf\u00e9? It was really embarrassing and humiliating.' So angered was Mr Roberts by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the Post Office. He also contacted Manchester Guide Dogs Association, which has been in contact with the Post Office. Sorry: The Post Office has issued an apology 'for any distress caused' following the incident . A spokesman for Guide Dogs said: 'We're always saddened when we hear about a shop or another service provider refusing access to a guide dog owner. The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to deny access to a guide dog owner. We are always happy to work with the Post Office, or any other organisation to help them understand their duties under the Equalities Act.' Mr Roberts said: 'I want a written apology from the Post Office and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again. 'It is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness.' Having posted the incident on Facebook he said he had received numerous comments in support of his complaint. 'One gentleman said that if that is the way the Post Office deals with a disabled person he would never come into the Post Office again,' said Mr Roberts, who has had Bruce for seven months and says he's his best friend. He has called the Chadderton Post Office employee's response to his guide dog 'outdated'. 'It is clearly an outdated view of things. I think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and shouldn't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do,' Mr Roberts said. 'I was determined to get this into the public eye because it probably does happen too often and happening just once is too many times.' A spokesman for the Post Office said: 'Post Office policy is to allow guide dogs and other assistance dogs into branches and we would like to apologise for any distress caused.' Chadderton postmaster Mr Parekh said: 'I have spoken to Craig and arranged for him to come back into the shop. Any misunderstanding between Craig and my staff will be rectified.'",

        "article": "Ronald Koeman called for Southampton's players to show maturity, nous and respect after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'",

        "article": "Ed Miliband's claim to crackdown on the super-rich unravelled today after it emerged Ed Balls has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money. The Labour leader used a speech to say he will 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, which applies to around 116,000 people, claiming they make Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'. But in January Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has pledged to scrap the controversial 'non-dom' status which allows millionaires to reduce their tax bil . The Labour leader visited Cheswick's Coffee shop  in  Rowley Regis in the West Midlands this afternoon . Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas.\u00a0They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. In a speech in Warwick today, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. He pledged to abolish the non-dom status from April 2016. He told an audience at the University of Warwick: 'Why should there be one rule for some and another for everybody else? 'It is not fair.\u00a0It is not just.\u00a0It holds Britain back.\u00a0We will stop it.\u00a0The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule. 'And we will replace it with a clear principle:\u00a0Anyone permanently resident in the UK will pay tax in the same way. 'The rules we will introduce are modelled on what other countries do.\u00a0Real temporary residents, here for a brief period, will only have to pay tax on what they earn here . 'Because they will be paying their taxes in their place of permanent residence.\u00a0But everyone else will have to pay tax on their worldwide income.' The status, which is unique to the UK having been introduced by William Pitt the Younger in the late 18th century, is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people. In January shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Mr Miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that 'anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for Britain'. He added: 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. 'There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country \u2013 it can no longer be justified, and it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few.' Non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in Britain. They must pay an annual fee, of up to \u00a390,000, to take advantage of the rules, which means it is only of us to the very wealthy. Newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But today it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. Mr Miliband said on Twitter that 'we should all pay taxes by the same rules' ahead of his speech in Coventry . Ex-Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne backed the Labour tax crackdown . Entrepreneur and ex-Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has backed Ed Miliband over the Labour leader's plan to scrap non-dom tax status. It comes after the hotelier signed a letter sent to the Daily Telegraph from more than 100 business leaders stating the 'Conservative-led Government has been good for business' and backing the cut in corporation tax to 20%. He tweeted: 'Ed Milliband says he will abolish non-dom status in UK. This gets my vote I never thought any party would have courage to do this.' Mr Balls said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports. But it emerged that when he was a Treasury minister in the last Labour government, Mr Balls insisted that 'the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the UK spent no more than five years here'. And in a January interview Mr Balls said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Asked by BBC Radio Leeds at the time if he would scrap the status, he said he was looking at tightening the system to 'make sure the non-dom rules work in a fair way'. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's proposals amounted to 'tinkering around the edges' not an outright ban. 'We have Ed Balls himself saying it would cost the country money,' Mr Osborne said on a campaign visit to a bank in Kingston, south London. 'It is a classic example of the economic chaos and confusion you get with Ed Miliband. It's why they have no economic credibility.' Mr Osborne said the Government's policy of increasing the fees charged to non-doms, which he raised as recently as December, had brought in more than \u00a31 billion. The Lib Dems said the number non-dom numbers 'exploded' under the last Labour government and more than doubled while Mr Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury . Tory Chancellor George Osborne warned the plan could cost Britain 'hundreds of millions of pounds' and stopped short of scrapping the rules, despite Labour's claims . Nick Clegg's party said it would\u00a0rack up existing fees for non don status as high as \u00a3150,000 a year . The Lib Dems were bounced into announcing their own crackdown on non doms by the Labour pledge. They would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as \u00a3150,000 a year. The party is also considering its own ban on non doms staying in Britain longer than a decade. But officials said they would not go ahead with this until it was clear it would raise money. And officials said there were 'dangers' that talent could leave the UK if non dom rules were seen to be 'unfair'. Officials said the plans were in the manifesto but brought forward after Ed Miliband's announcement. The Lib Dems would also ban people from inheriting non-dom status from their parent. The party's manifesto will commit to raising the levy on non-doms who have been in the country for more than seven of the past nine years from \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000. Non doms in the country for 12 of the past 14 years would rise from \u00a360,000 to \u00a3100,000 and for people who have been in the country for 17 of the past 19 years from \u00a390,000 to \u00a3150,000. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut. 'People were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country. It's not actually turned out to be the case,' he said. 'The abuse is bigger than we thought. These rules are ridiculous, they are unfair, they are being abused, and I think it's time to act. 'These were introduced in the period of the Napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the UK. 'That's fine, it's a different world now, a different time, different choices.' Admitting he was not scrapping non-dom rules completely, he said that Labour would allow 'a short period for existing non-doms to get their affairs sorted out'. Asked about the exemptions, he said: 'What we will do in the future is if people are coming here temporarily to work or to study, then we'll allow a short period, I think five years is probably too long. 'I'm thinking more the length of a normal postgraduate or university degree, say two to three years.' Mr Osborne said 'the right approach' was to hit 'non-doms' with higher annual charges for exploiting the system - effectively making it only worthwhile for the very wealthiest. The Liberal Democrats said they planned to take an additional \u00a3130 million from non-doms by reforming eligibility rules and 'significantly increasing the charges'. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'The key tests are what maximises revenue for the exchequer and best supports our economic recovery.' 'Non-dom numbers exploded under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, more than doubling when Ed Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury,' he said. 'We came down hard on those who stayed in the UK for long periods without paying their share - increasing charges on non-doms year-on-year since 2010. Labour used to allow non-doms to sit in the House of Lords, Lib Dems stopped that. 'In the next parliament we want to go further by radically reforming the rules and significantly increasing the charges for non-doms to secure an additional GBP130 million for the public purse.'",
        "highlights": "Ed Miliband will today pledge to scrap the controversial 'non-dom' status .\nThe rule allows Britain's richest to avoid UK tax on their worldwide income .\nLabour will claim it's open to abuse and offends the moral basis of taxation .\nBut critics will say it is another example of Labour's anti-business agenda .",

Harry Kane capped off an 'unreal' season to land the PFA Young Player of the Year 2015 on Sunday . Kane has scored 20 Premier League goals for Tottenham this year in a dream breakthrough season . The 21-year-old arrived on Sunday having also been shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year award .

PFA Women's Young Player of the Year: Leah Williamson . The Tottenham striker was congratulated on social media, with the likes of Gary Lineker and Spurs taking to Twitter to show their support. Kane came through the White Hart Lane club's youth ranks and he made his Premier League debut for Spurs during the 2012-13 season but it wasn't until this season that he broke into the first-team. He struck a free-kick winner from the bench at Aston Villa in early November and was then given a run of games by Mauricio Pochettino, with fellow frontmen Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to deliver. And he has not looked back since. 'It is amazing. It is a very proud moment for myself and my family - hopefully the first of many to come,' Kane said of his award. 'I have got to keep working hard, but to be recognised by your fellow players is something special and it is a night I wont forget. It is incredible, an incredible feeling. 'It is amazing.

'It is incredible, an incredible feeling.' Asked to sum up his season in one word, Kane went for: 'Unreal.' Never doubting himself, had he been told 12 months ago this was his destiny, Kane said: 'I'd have said let's do it - let's get it on. 'A lot has changed since then but I have always believed in my ability and have been waiting for a chance to express myself. I didn't think it would go as quickly as it has done but I have managed to ride the wave and the season has got better and better. 'I got the opportunity with the gaffer and I have really enjoyed my season so far - I have taken my chance and this is why we are here.' Kane has been the shining light of the Tottenham side, and said: 'We have worked hard and I have worked hard to get to where we are now. It is going great and hopefully it is the start with more to come.' His stand-out occasion of the season came not in a Tottenham shirt, but when Roy Hodgson ushered him into the England side, Kane scoring after 79 seconds of his debut off the bench against Lithuania on March 27, in a European Championship qualifier. Asked for his favourite moment, Kane said: 'Making my England debut and getting that goal - it was a very proud moment. It made it even more special. 'For a footballer, to represent their country is the pinnacle, and I'm very proud. I was able to do that and it was a moment I won't forget.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino tipped the Chingford-born forward for even bigger things after he scored in the recent 3-1 win at Newcastle, to become the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to reach 30 club goals in a season. Kane beat off stiff competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (pictured) to win the award . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) was joined by team-mate\u00a0Philippe Coutinho at the awards bash . Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, currently on loan at Manchester City, attended with fiancee Christine Bleakley . 'He has big potential,' the Argentinian said. 'He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' Kane captained the north London outfit for the first time in a goalless draw at Burnley earlier this month.

        "article": "A senior writer for the Australian Financial Review has labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs', while standing up for an SBS football reporter  who was sacked after condemning Anzac day on Twitter. SBS journalist Scott McIntyre was fired on Sunday\u00a0over his tweets which called Anzac day 'the cultification of an imperialist invasion' and accused Australian Diggers of committing war crimes which included 'widespread rape and theft.' Speaking up in support of him, the AFR's Geoff Winestock wrote on the social media site: 'Ridiculous. Frightening. I also think Anzacs were racist yobs and Anzac Day is a death cult. Sack me Fairfax.' On Friday, the day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said of the memorial: 'Anzac Day wish: in next 30 years there will be no wars and in 50 years no soldiers around to honour.' Scroll down for video . Australian Financial Review journalist Geoff Winestock (left) has spoken out in support of sacked SBS journalist Scott McIntyre (right), who was fired on Sunday over his controversial Anzac day tweets . The senior writer for the Australian Financial Review labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs' The day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said he hoped 'in 50 years no soldiers around to honour' Both Fairfax and Mr Winestock declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments,  SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp\u00a0said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre\u2019s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre\u2019s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid\u00a0was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula. In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted. 'Wonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. Mr McIntyre has more than 30,000 Twitter followers. The SBS journalist accused the Australian diggers of committing war crimes . McIntyre condemned the commemoration of Anzac Day and mocked the Digger's bravery . McIntyre's comments referred to the soldiers as 'terrorists' and were met with disgust by Twitter users . McIntyre's comments came on the 100th anniversary of the tragic Battle of Gallipoli (members of the public seen streaming into the Australian War Memorial, right, and names of fallen soldiers, left) Mr Turnbull also chimed into the discussion, calling the comments 'offensive' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the national broadcaster from McIntyre's comments\u00a0on Saturday evening, after incensed social media users launched a Twitter tirade calling for the company to fire the reporter. 'Comments from @mcintinhos are his own, disrespectful and not at all the views of @SBS. We remember and commemorate our ANZACs,' Mr Ebeid wrote on Twitter. The offensive tweets were still live on McIntyre's Twitter feed the day after they were published, prompting angry social media users to accuse SBS of being 'complicit' and labelling Mr Ebeid's tweet a 'token apology.' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the media company . Angry social media users accused SBS of being 'complicit' Others accused SBS Managing Director Mr Ebeid's of making a 'token apology' last night . Social media users claimed that the tweets were offensive and 'un-Australian' especially on Anzac Day . SBS has since responded with an official apology for offence caused, stating 'respect for Australian audiences is paramount at SBS.' 'At SBS, employees on and off air are encouraged to participate in social media, however maintaining the integrity of the network and audience trust is vital,' Mr Ebeid and Mr Shipp said in the today's statement. 'It is unfortunate that on this very important occasion, Mr McIntyre\u2019s comments have compromised both. 'SBS apologises for any offence or harm caused by Mr McIntyre\u2019s comments which in no way reflect the views of the network. SBS supports our Anzacs and has devoted unprecedented resources to coverage of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.' Flag bearers stand to attention during the 100th anniversary service of ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Galllipoli, an event the Australian sports reporter has called 'an imperialist invasion' Twitter users labelled McIntyre's comments an 'Un-australian anti Anzac disgrace!' Disgusted social media users began circulating the hashtag #sackScottMcIntyre. Twitter user Brian Cox wrote: '#sackScottMcIntyre SBS sack this dirty traitor! Un-australian anti Anzac disgrace! Calling Anzac's war criminals on this sacred day!' 'Come on SBS this disrespectful little grub needs to go #sackScottMcIntyre,' Jimmy Nuciforo added. 'The ANZACS died defending what this idiot is abusing - free speech,' tweeted another social media user. The hashtag #sackScottMcIntyre began trending on Twitter after social media users saw his comments . McIntyre's comments were labelled offensive, especially in light of the centenary of Gallipoli . Some Twitter users defended his right to free speech, and said that if Mr McIntyre was fired for 'speaking the truth' that was compromising his right to express himself. Others took offense to the fact the comments were coming from someone employed with taxpayer funds. 'He should lose his taxpayer funded job,' said one Twitter user, while another said, 'Not normally my thing, but since I am paying for it .... #sackScottMcIntyre'.",

Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool\u2019s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) hasn't disciplined Sterling (pictured) or Ibe for the incident . Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi . Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter.\u00a0He said: \u2018It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. \u2018It\u2019s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. \u2018It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about this instance \u2014 (but) how it gets framed is totally different.\u2019 Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension . \u2018When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. \u2018Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

        "article": "Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter \u2013 who will be fourth in line to the throne \u2013 by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess \u2013 whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival \u2013 including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess \u2013 whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name \u2013 and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet \u00a310,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) \u2013 now 6/1 joint favourite \u2013 with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday \u2013 their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne \u2013 although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh \u2013 the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl \u2013 while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.",

The game was settled shortly before the break in the additional half hour, when Sam Gallagher unleashed a wonder-strike from long-range, after the two-legged tie had ended 1-1 after 180 minutes. Gallagher, who made 18 Premier League appearances for the club last season, but has not been in the first team this time around, smashed a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards, giving Blackburn keeper David Raya no chance, after cutting in from the right wing and playing a one-two with Josh Sims.

The Saints players mob goalscorer Ryan Seager after he converted a chance to put them ahead . Earlier, striker Ryan Seager had put Saints ahead with a tidy finish after the ball fell fortuitously to him in the Blackburn box, but the unfortunate Matt Targett turned the ball into his own net to level the game. Targett is the latest of a string of promising left backs to emerge from the club's academy and get a chance in the first team, but he could do nothing when a deflected cross struck him on the head and trickled past Paulo Gazzaniga. Southampton were reduced to 10 men late on in normal time, when midfielder Harrison Reed, who had been superb in the goalless first leg, was dismissed for a second bookable offence. But the hosts held on for extra time in front of 12,000 fans at St Mary's, and the home faithful were rewarded with a winning goal of the highest quality.

        "article": "(CNN)Is there anything laser can't do? From cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites, all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue, there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser. Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list: using focused laser beams to affect the weather. It sounds like black magic, but it's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding, a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by China in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony. But it's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is, and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere, something which it surely doesn't need. Laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding: it's light, and nothing but light. How does laser actually affect the weather? Just like cloud seeding, it can create new clouds where there are none, by inducing condensation: naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets, and ice crystals form, mimicking the natural process that creates clouds. That way, rainfall can be triggered to \"empty\" the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on: \"We did it on a laboratory scale, we can already create clouds, but not on a macroscopic scale, so you don't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we can't yet control,\" Professor Wolf told CNN's Nick Glass. That is not to say that the laser he's tested isn't powerful: at one terawatt, it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on Earth: \"Of course, it doesn't last very long,\" Wolf said. The technology is still in its infancy then, but once it's perfected, it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast, such as California or Chile, where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity. Through lasers, those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas: \"You can transport the water to a different location,\" Wolf said. Laser seeding can make more than clouds: it can also trigger lightning. \"We also showed that it's possible to trigger lightning in clouds, within clouds, but not to the ground, yet.\" Recent tests have shown promise: \" A few years ago, in New Mexico, we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere, trying to trigger lightning. We didn't, but we could see some small discharge, lightning, within the cloud. You know, 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud, not against the Earth. So, we are still working on that, but there is hope.\" Controlling lightning, or facilitating its discharge in a desired location, would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year, adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes. Affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change. Professor Wolf reckons lasers could be used to \"repair\" the weather, reducing the occurrence of hurricanes, thunderstorms, flooding, and drought. But his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds: \"There are potential applications in the biomedical field: by changing the color of the laser, we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells, with little or no collateral damage.\" Yet another potential application to add to that list: \"Every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers, something new comes up: it's quite amazing.\"",

Workplace issues: Johnson has claimed a supervisor at the Hooters where she worked (pictured) had an issue with her getting blonde highlights . Johnson continued 'And the manager at the time literally said \"You can't have blonde, cause black people don't have blonde hair.\"' Johnson told the television station she was given reduced shifts, written warnings, and later terminated. An arbitrator determined Johnson was let go illegally and as a result of racial discrimination, WBAL reported.\u00a0He also reportedly\u00a0said Hooters violated state civil rights laws, as well as federal ones. According to WBAL, Johnson has been awarded $250,000 for  both her legal fees and lost wages. Ruling: An arbitrator recently ruled in Johnson's favor. She is seen here in 2013 . Johnson's attorney Andrew Levy told the television station 'I hope that Hooters sees this as an opportunity to make improvements in the way they train their managers and they way they deal with their employees.' In a statement, Hooters said '[Johnson] claimed that Hooters actions were discriminatory and that the company does not allow African-American women to wear colors in their hair that are not natural for their ethnicity. Nothing could be further from the truth.' 'Ms. Johnson's claims of discrimination are simply without merit,' the company said. The arbitrator's decision in the case was 'adverse and flawed,' Hooters said. 'Contrary to exaggerated reports, Ms. Johnson did not receive $250,000 in back pay, but rather only $11,886.40, while her attorneys on the other hand received approximately $244,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees,' the restaurant chain's statement said.",

        "article": "It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (\u00a31.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (\u00a31.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'",

        "article": "Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called \"Princess.\" \"Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,\" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. \"Nobody fills that boot now.\" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, \"a jolly soul,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: \"Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love.\" \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,\" Pellegrini told the jury. \"And that is the very essence of terror.\" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. \"These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,\" Pellegrini said. \"Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters.\" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. \"She traded that in for a bat,\" Campbell said. \"She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her.\" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" Pellegrini said. \"Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused.\" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \"the enemy,\" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. \"He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,\" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. \"But it didn't stop him from murdering them.\" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. \"There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,\" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. \"Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,\" she said, and began to cry. \"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere.\" Were you bleeding? she was asked. \"Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,\" she said. \"I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive.\" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury. She said it was \"a surreal, out-of-body experience.\"  She remembers thinking, \"What was that?\" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. \"It hurt too much. I just didn't care,\" she said. \"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.  I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die.\" And then, she said, \"the mom in me\" took over. She remembers telling herself: \" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'\" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. \"Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,\" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. \"There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,\" she said from the witness stand. \"The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life.\" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. \"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,\" she said. \"Inclines are very hard.\" Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

        "article": "Tehran, Iran (CNN)There is a Persian proverb that says: \"A good year is determined by its spring.\" For many Iranians, the historic decision by Tehran and six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a \"joint comprehensive plan of action\" is an indication that this year's Norouz, the Persian New Year that started on March 21, will be a superb one indeed. Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his \"moderate\" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so \"only\" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well. READ MORE: What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points . Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement.",

        "article": "It's a classic Australian saying: 'G'day mate, how you going?'. But when one Australian traveller tried to get American's to repeat it, many were lost for words. Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, recently spent months travelling across the US, and documented his interactions with locals all around the country. From a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about Britney Spears, to a man who insisted Murray was saying 'Get out of my nightgown', the filmmaker captured it all. Scroll down for video . Aussie filmmaker Kieran Murray has released the second installment of his hilarious series which asks Americans to attempt the Australian accent by saying 'G'day mate, how you going? One man in Austin, Texas (far right) was convinced Murray said 'Get out (of) my nightgown' This is the latest in a series of videos Murray put together one of which is based around the same topic, and another of which asks people to guess what common Australian expressions mean. 'I don't even know what he said!' exclaimed one Texan when asked by the Brisbane man to repeat the phrase. 'Say it again in English?', asked a man in Manhattan, New York. 'Sounds Chinese to me man,' he later added. Many people threw strange sideways glances at the man, trying to understand what he was saying, with one man declaring 'that's Spanish!'. Others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic Australian vernacular, and Murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of Britney Spears' dads house. This New Yorker said 'sounds Chinese to me man', when speaking to the Brisbane man . One man in Nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the Aussie accent . This man, who didn't quite get the gist of the question, was insistent on telling a story about Britney Spears . 'I lived in the back, of Britney Spears' dads house', the man, who appears to be homeless, told the filmaker over and over again. When he was asked again to repeat the phrase after Murray, he simply said: 'All right'. While on the subway Murray asked one man to repeat what he said, but he simply declared 'Can't do it'. 'I don't know what you said, were those words?' one woman, who appeared to be at a sporting event, asked the Australian. 'What the hell'd you say?' exclaimed one hog hunter in Texas. Kids giggled as they tried to understand what Murray was saying in his Australian accent . Many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused Americans . Children weren't much better and translating the popular Aussie phrase, but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in Austin, Texas. 'Wait I got this,' the man said while surrounded by his friends before triumphantly proclaiming: 'Get out my nightgown!'. 'That's the one. Get out my nightgown. I got it right, I already know I got it,' the man said. Murray even managed to stump a speech therapist who struggled to understand the Australian accent. The video, aptly titled 'G'day Mate: The Sequel' can be viewed in full on Murray's YouTube page.",

No notable dissent from Liverpool fans, away in the far corner. They joined his appeals for a penalty when he had been nudged over by Hector Bellerin. Body Language: . Good. Bright and busy.

        "article": "An incarcerated mother has revealed that her one-year-old son celebrated his first birthday in prison with a party that featured donated presents and a colorful cake shared by the prison staffers who served as the toddler's guests. Jayla Currie from Berne, Indiana, is a part of the Wee Ones Nursery\u00a0program at the Indiana Women\u2019s Prison, a system that was established in 2008 and allows mothers, like Jayla, to share rooms with their babies while they serve out their sentences. In 23-year-old Jayla\u2019s case that means a 10 month sentence for drug charges. 'I\u2019ve gotten to see Jayden reach all of his milestones,' Jayla told Yahoo Parenting of living with her son. 'The most amazing one was watching him take his first steps. It still scares me to death.' Unique location: Jayla Currie posed with her son Jayden as he enjoyed birthday cake at his first birthday party, which was held at the\u00a0Indiana Women\u2019s Prison . As a part of the program, mothers and their babies have private rooms in one housing unit, which also contains other female inmates, who don't have any violent offenses on their records, to serve as trained nannies and help care for the infants when the parents have to attend certain obligations. Jayla noted that their rooms are as 'homey as possible', adding that instead of the metal bunkbeds that are often associated with prison life, she has a bed, a crib, a dresser, a closet and even a chair. She explained that her unit has 38 women in it, meaning that Jayden has constant attention. The mother-of-one, who has already served three months of her reduced 10-month sentence for meth manufacturing and possession, never thought she would be raising her child behind bars. Her life started to spiral out of control when she dropped out of cosmetology school at 19-years-old. She started taking pharmaceutical drugs and began a relationship with a man who was making meth. Jayla recalled that by the time she was 20, she was frequently using drugs and had also stopped paying her bills. By 21 she began helping her boyfriend to manufacture and sell meth. Special bond: The 23-year-old is a part of the Wee Ones Nursery, a program that allows incarcerated mothers to share rooms with their babies . 'I was spending every waking minute trying to get high,' she said. A year later, she was arrested and charged with\u00a0two counts of meth manufacturing and possession and sentenced to six years in prison. After her family posted her bond, 30 days after she was incarcerated, Jayla unexpectedly got pregnant during her 60-day release, something which she now describes as 'very bad timing'. Jayla then spent six months in county jail before she signed a plea bargain last March. When she was seven months pregnant, she was transferred to Indiana Women's Prison. Two months later she gave birth to Jayden in a single room with just a doctor and a female officer. 'I spent my whole pregnancy thinking I couldn\u2019t keep my son because of the amount of time I had to serve my sentence,' she recalled. 'To be able to have him here with me is wonderful.' Added touches: Jayden's birthday party inside the prison included a sheet cake and numerous decorations . Different kind of home: This is an outside view of the\u00a0Indiana Women\u2019s Prison where Jayla and Jayden will live until her expected release this October . The Wee Ones Nursery program aims to help incarcerated mothers bond with their newborns in a way that would have previously been impossible for them. In order to quality, female inmates have to quality for certain criteria, including a release date that is not more than 18 months after their projected delivery dates. According to a 2013\u00a0study\u00a0from the University of Indianapolis\u2019 Community Research Center, incarcerated women who live with their newborn infants in the special nursery wing at the prison are more likely to retain custody of their children after release and less likely to be arrested again. After her expected release this October, Jayla plans on moving in with her mom and working at a recycling factory owned by her family. She is actually worried that leaving the prison community will be the hardest on her son, who has grown up with Jayla's fellow inmates. The devoted mother said that she will definitely tell him about his time in prison when he gets older. 'I\u2019m not ashamed because I\u2019m proud of who I\u2019ve become,' she said.",

Yesterday, as commemorations were held all over the world to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the Royal Family led tributes to those who fought and fell in the ill-fated offensive. The day began in London with a dawn ceremony at Wellington Arch on Hyde Park Corner, attended by Princess Anne. Later the Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William and political leaders, led the nation during a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, while Prince Charles was in Turkey with Prince Harry.

The national flags of Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and the UK were carried through the Abbey and placed close to the high altar as a sign of reconciliation between old enemies. Earlier, Charles and Harry joined more than 10,000 people in a dawn pilgrimage at Gallipoli to honour the bravery of the Allied troops who stormed the peninsula's beaches in 1915. The landings were supposed to be a decisive blow that would knock the Turks out of the war. But eight months of bloody fighting later, after an estimated 145,000 lives on both sides had been lost, the Allies pulled out, having failed in their objective. Around 58,000 Allied troops were killed, many from Australia and New Zealand. Almost 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried or commemorated on Gallipoli. Prince Charles gave a moving reading about troops weeping as they left their dead comrades behind when they left Gallipoli. He read the words of a soldier, who wrote: 'The hardest feature of the evacuation was in leaving those dead comrades behind. They had bequeathed us a sacred trust.'

        "article": "Samantha Cameron showcased another election campaign outfit this morning, firming up her position as the most stylish of the politician's partners. The Prime Minister's wife showed her support of UK business by sporting a thoroughly British outfit at the\u00a0Conservative Party's manifesto launch in Swindon. Wearing a simple but elegant \u00a3185 emerald green wrap dress by London-based designer The Fold, Mrs Cameron looked every inch the First Lady of British politics as she arrived at the town's University Technical Colleges. Winning in the style stakes: Samantha Cameron, wearing an \u00a3185 Hampton dress in emerald green from The Fold, supports husband David as he launches the Conservative Party's manifesto in Swindon . A vision in green: Sam Cam (centre) adds a dash of glamour as she applauds her husband while seated between George Osborne (right) and William Hague (left) All smiles: Samantha laughs at one of the Prime Minister's more jovial points . Sam Cam, 43, a huge fan of British designers, showed her commitment to UK brands once again by plumping for the Hampton dress. The midi dress with cap sleeves and narrow V-neck is made from a non-crease poly twill fabric, perfect for a woman travelling a lot - and a busy mother-of-four. The look was finished with a slim white belt to accentuate Samantha's enviable waistline and a pair of black heels. The company behind the frock has a flagship store in Clerkenwell and was founded by Polly McMaster. The label specialises in contemporary work-wear. Their collection is designed with 'modern, professional women in mind' which makes them an ideal fit for Sam Cam. Other celebrity fans include Davina McCall and Amanda Holden. Liking what they hear: George and Samantha look happy with their man . Wearing green but thinking blue: Samantha stands out against the Tory suits . Sam, who appeared to have caught some Easter sun, showed off tanned legs and arms, but kept her make-up simple with some subtle berry lipstick. Jewellery was a pair of gold hoops and a slim gold chain bracelet. The Prime Minister's wife recently showcased another element of her style - her taste in interiors, as a series of pictures of the Cameron's kitchen dining room were released, along with their 1950s retro-chic sofas and chairs and a funky steel lamp stretching over the table. Promises: Mr Cameron took to the lectern to talk about the Tory party's intentions including doubling free childcare for working parents . Listening intently: Samantha looked comfortable in her emerald green wrap dress . Today, she sat, the proverbial rose between two thorns, next to George Osborne and William Hague, listening intently as her husband took to the stage to outline his party's key policies ahead of the general election on May 7. In launching his manifesto, Mr Cameron promised voters 'the good life' as he vowed to double free childcare for working parents and guarantee workers on the minimum wage will never pay income tax. David had Sam's full attention and she only paused to smile, exchange some knowing looks with the Chancellor and to applaud. She also laughed heartily to the PM's jokes and smiled broadly at other times, although occasionally pausing to adjust her long bob. After the speech was over she and her husband left hand in hand, with Sam almost appearing to lead Dave. View from the back: David and Samantha make their way out of the venue . Smiling into the sunshine: Holding hands, the Prime Minister and his wife leave the conference at the University Technical Colleges in Swindon . A wave to the crowds: David and Samantha look happy after launching the manifesto . A helping hand: The PM shows his chivalrous side as he helped his wife get into a waiting car . During the speech, Cameron claimed Britain is 'on the brink of something special' as he unveiled a cradle-to-grave Conservative manifesto, promising voters 'security at every stage of your life'. The Prime Minister warned there is 'almost nothing without economic security' as he set out an extension of Margaret Thatcher's hugely popular Right to Buy scheme, vowed to scrap inheritance tax on homes worth up to \u00a31million and promised to freeze rail fares for five years. While the audience cheered these plans, Samantha's sartorial choices were also a clear success. Her latest appearance on the campaign trail comes after a MailOnline poll found that if the electorate were voting for wives of politicians, they'd put her at the top of the tree. The latest Populus survey saw the Conservatives and Labour tied on 33 per cent, but if Mrs Cameron went up against Justine Miliband she surges to 38 per cent with Labour on 30 per cent. A new Populus poll for MailOnline asked how people would vote if (left to right) Samantha Cameron, Miriam Clegg, Justine Miliband and Kirsten Farage were leaders instead of their husbands . If wives ruled the world: The Tories would have an 8-point lead over Labour if the women replaced their husbands as leader, a Populus poll for MailOnline reveals . Senior Tories have described Mrs Cameron as their \u2018secret weapon\u2019 and her appearances on the campaign trail dominated coverage in the days after the election was called. The poll asked voters which party they would vote for if the women were the leaders instead of their husbands. Mrs Cameron came out on top with 38 per cent, with Mrs Miliband on 30 per cent. Some 21 per cent said they would back Miriam Clegg, much higher than 8 per cent currently enjoyed by husband Nick in the same survey. Just 11 per cent of people said they would vote for Ukip if Nigel Farage\u2019s wife Kirsten was leader. Mrs Farage keeps a much lower profile that the other leaders\u2019 wives, with both Mrs Clegg and Mrs Miliband making regular appearances in the media and on the campaign trail.",

Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was \"having some health issues.\" Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move,\" she told the magazine. \"I thought I was dying.\" Lyme disease: What you should know . Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. \"There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,\" she told People. \"It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.\" Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease . After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. \"The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply,\" she said. Now declaring herself \"80 percent better,\" Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a \"wake-up call\" that has given her a new perspective. \"I really just want to enjoy life from here on out,\" she said.",

        "article": "In February of this year, bride-to-be Adele McKenzie found the dress she had dreamed of wearing when she married her partner of nine years, David Elliot. Little did she know she would never get the chance to wear it, despite already paying for half. The 31-year-old said when she slipped into the white lacy gown, she instantly saw herself standing in front of her friends and family and exchanging marriage vows with the love of her life. \u2018I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl,\u2019 she told Daily Mail Australia. Adele McKenzie was set to marry the love of her life, David Elliot, when she was devastated to learn the bridal company she had paid around $1,000 to for her dress had closed down . Ms McKenzie said she wasn't able to buy the $2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with \u2018The Bridal Centre\u2019. She started paying in February and planned to pay off her dress by July - around three months before her wedding - giving her time to make alterations. In early April, Ms McKenzie\u2019s dress dream was shattered when she opened an email from the bridal company that said they were going bankrupt. Ms McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia she was left feeling \u2018panicked\u2019 and \u2018anxious\u2019 when she was faced with the news that she would need to find a new wedding dress for her big day. \u2018My first reaction was to call The Bridal Centre and it was consistently busy across the long weekend. Their Facebook was active and we were putting up posts without a response.' The Bridal Centre's Facebook page was inundated with messages from disappointed brides who already had their hearts set on a wedding dress . Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same \u2018generic\u2019 email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with their weddings only weeks away. She tried to go onto the Bridal Centre's website but it was deactivated and that's when she realised she had no way of getting in contact with the company she already paid $1,000, which was meant to go towards paying off her dress. The happy couple have been together for nine years and plan to wed in November 2015 . \u2018It was stressful and pretty upsetting,\u2019 she said. Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same \u2018generic\u2019 email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with weddings only weeks away. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie said the group called \u2018Where\u2019s My Dress?\u2019 became inundated with \u2018generous offers\u2019 from \u2018lovely ladies\u2019 and \u2018amazing bridal companies\u2019 who offered them free \u2018pre-loved\u2019, and even brand new, wedding gowns. While some women have received their money back, unfortunately Ms McKenzie said she is still waiting to hear from the Bridal Centre about whether she will be one of the lucky ones who can use that money to buy another dress. Ms McKenzie revealed she would need another $1,000 deposit to move forward with a different dress, however at this stage, with all the financial pressure that comes with planning a wedding, she isn't sure she can afford it. \u2018It\u2019s very difficult financially, I can\u2019t take the next step to get another dress. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get it back.\u2019 \u2018I am six months out of my wedding and I\u2019m anxious and stressed out,' she said. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie is expecting around 70 guests at her wedding that will be held in Sydney's Terrey Hills, with some travelling from interstate and overseas. 'There\u2019s a lot of planning and  it\u2019s added pressure on top.' 'It\u2019s getting more difficult as the weeks draw closer,\u2019 she added. Ms McKenzie said the trusting brides had no idea the company was facing financial difficulties as they continued to take payments from their clients right up until the day before they sent the email that notified them of their money woes. \u2018[It] is just disgraceful. They knew what was happening. If they didn't want to tell us the truth, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t take our money,\u2019 she said. \u2018At the end of the day, I\u2019m marrying the man of my dreams so I\u2019m trying to not let it affect it too much.\u2019 After thinking she had secured the dress she had dreamed of since she was a little girl, Ms McKenzie said she was devastated she was going to have to fight to get it back. \u2018You find this dress and you fall in love with it. Now I have to go through this process, it\u2019s so upsetting. \u2018I don\u2019t want this,\u2019 she added. Ms McKenzie said despite her awful experience she is trying to move forward and instead\u00a0focus on  on the man who will be standing at the end of the aisle, regardless of what she is wearing. \u2018At the end of the day, I\u2019m marrying the man of my dreams so I\u2019m trying to not let it affect it too much.\u2019",

        "article": "Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on Monday. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahideen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of 8-year-old bomb victim Martin Richard, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev, 21 years old, stands accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began on March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The prosecution on Monday played a graphic video of the scene of the bombing that showed a chaotic, bloody scene with injured people everywhere. A child's piercing cries are heard. It's the son of Rebekah Gregory, who lost her leg. Then, another photo is displayed. This time jurors see Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"It was Tamerlan,\" defense attorney Clarke repeated during her closing argument Monday. \"In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" she said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" But he was only following his brother, she insisted. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Richard's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out.\" Krystle Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto,\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston Marathon Terror Attack Fast Facts .",

But these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers. As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips. These days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers (file image) Almost 40 per cent of people, including 66 per cent of those aged 18-29, spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it, according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer Alfresia.co.uk. Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: \u2018British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. \u2018Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.\u2019 Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: \u2018The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.\u2019 As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species \u2013 daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden \u2013 and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth \u00a31,928.

        "article": "A former doctor charged with killing a Yale University physician he once worked with has been found incompetent to stand trial for the second time. New Haven Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Keefe Jr. ruled Monday that 49-year-old Lishan Wang should be sent to Connecticut Valley Hospital for treatment. In a court report submitted last month, mental health experts said Wang displayed 'paranoid thinking' and was 'guarded and suspicious' when discussing a relationship with court-appointed lawyers. Lishan Wang was charged with murder in the shooting of Yale University doctor Vajinder Toor outside his home in April 2010 . He was originally ruled incompetent in 2010,\u00a0but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. A new evaluation was ruled after a public defender\u00a0filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation . The ruling came after two mental health experts testified that Wang is unable to rationally understand criminal proceedings or assist in his defense, according to\u00a0The Hartford Courant. Wang, a father of three, is charged with murder in the shooting of Dr. Vajinder Toor, 34, and shooting but missing Toor's then-pregnant wife outside the couple's Branford, Connecticut, home in April 2010. Police say the shooting stemmed from a dispute the men had two years earlier while working together at a New York City hospital. Wang, who represented himself at the hearing, is due back in court on May 21. The report said that Wang would not be able to 'establish an effective relationship with a defense attorney or to organize himself in a manner that he could be meaningfully understood by others' in his current state. Wang and Toor worked together at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in New York City, and Wang had a history of confronting Toor and other staff members before his dismissal in 2008. Toor (pictured) was shot outside of his\u00a0Branford, Connecticut, home. After the shooting, Wang was found in his van with documents referring to his dismissal from Kingsbrook Medical Center in New York City, where it's believed he had confrontations with Toor . After the shooting, police found Wang in his van with documents referring to his dismissal and others involved. They also found a wig, hammer, knife and about a thousand rounds of ammunition. In 2010 Wang was originally ruled incompetent, but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. When a second competency evaluation was ordered earlier this year after Chief Public Defender Thomas J. Ullmann filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation. Ullmann said that Wang is mentally ill, which Wang countered by accusing the public defenders of working against him. 'This is much more complicated because of particular issues in this case that it's hard for me to figure out even where to start,' O'Keefe told The Hartford Courant. 'He chooses to represent himself, which he has a right to do, but it causes some problems on how to proceed.' Wang has asked to represent himself in his trial and accused the public defender's office of working against him . While representing himself, Wang will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, make his own statements and testify on his own behalf. Though Wang did not testify at Monday's hearing, he referred to a rebuttal of the competency report in which he quoted\u00a0Dostoyevsky, Socrates, Richard Nixon, Abraham Lincoln and alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as well as recounts two parables. Wang said that the experts misinterpreted his answers, misquoted him and lacked knowledge about his 'cultural background'. One of the experts from the competency report, Madelon Baranoski, said that Wang lost his 'path of rational thinking' during the evaluation and that he suffers from 'a very serious mental illness'. She added that his distrust of the public defender's office was 'reaching psychotic proportions'. 'It is our opinion that you need treatment,' she said.

'It's like the last piece of prohibition,' says Robert, 73, who worked as a police officer from 1970 to 1986 before performing criminal justice training for another decade.

'I tried it once and I tell you, I was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening to Rhapsody in Blue, which I know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds, and it lasted for, oh hell, two or three hours,' says Robert. David, who served as a reserve police officer from 1997 to 2004, says he smoked for the first time at the age 14, but stopped for a while afterward because he got caught.

In between bong hits and self-administered field sobriety tests, the trio debates the dangers and benefits of using marijuana. Rene says that one argument for\u00a0legalizing the drug is knowing what you're getting when you buy it; he explains that when people get it on the street, they don't always know what their marijuana has been cut with. Sometimes it can be mixed with more dangerous substances. While they disagree on whether it's a gateway drug - Robert notes that every heroin addict started out drinking milk, implying that it's difficult to link the use of one product to another - they all seem to agree that legal\u00a0repercussions\u00a0for using marijuana do more harm than good. 'It costs more to put someone in prison than it does to send someone to Harvard,' says Robert, suggesting that sending people to prison for marijuana possession or distribution is a wasteful drain on society. 'As far as I can remember, I never arrested anyone for it, but I took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of them,' says Rene, adding that he thought that his personal punishment was a bigger deterrent than writing them a citation. Pot partakers: Rene, left, says he never wrote a criminal citation to someone with marijuana, but would throw out their drugs in front of them; while he served, it was illegal in every state . Special cause: The video links to Shona Banda's GoFundMe page, which is raising money for the Kansas mother's legal defense; her 11-year-old son was taken away from her for discussing medical marijuana . At one point, the interviewer tells the former officers that some people report feeling sexually aroused when they smoke. 'I'm 73 years old, I don't know what the hell you're talking about!' answers Robert. 'It's been so long since I've made love, I can't remember who ties up whom!' While the ex-cops' cracks are certainly meant to elicit laughs, the video also aims to promote the\u00a0GoFundMe page of activist\u00a0Shona Banda. The Kansas mother's 11-year-old son was taken away from her late last month when, during a drug discussion at his school, he extolled the benefits of medical  marijuana. Shona, who used cannabis oil to treat her Crohn\u2019s disease, is now raising money for her legal fees.",

Now there\u2019s a mouse designed to let geeks continue their gaming adventures without working up a sweat \u2013 on their hands at least. A mouse called Ventus X has a built-in honeycomb grill to let the skin breathe and a rugged coating so sweaty gamers can continue to the accessory. No sweat: Now there\u2019s a mouse designed to let geeks continue their gaming adventures without working up a sweat \u2013 on their hands at least. The Venus X (pictured) has a built-in honeycomb grill to let the skin breathe and a rugged coating so sweaty gamers can continue to the accessory . The mouse provides \u2018enhanced modern technology and classic design that fits all gamers and bring style to gaming,\u2019 according to the Taiwan-based firm that makes it. Some realistic combat and multiplayer games tap into the body\u2019s flight or fight response, causing adrenaline to surge through gamers\u2019 bodies and prepare the body for physical activity. While clicking violently may not qualify as a work out, gamers can get sweaty, and this can make their mouse slippery. Game on:\u00a0Some realistic combat and multiplayer games tap into the body\u2019s flight or fight response, causing adrenaline to surge through gamers\u2019 bodies and prepare the body for physical activity, by sweating for example. Here, \u00a0gamer in Burma concentrates hard on a game of World of Warcraft . Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side (pictured) Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, Taiwan-based ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side. \u2018The new VENTUS X was designed with a new coating that gives full comfort while in gameplay,\u2019 it says. This means that the tool retains its grip in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill where the hand rests on the mouse. The grille\u2019s meant to help because sweat can evaporate faster than on a solid surface, when a user raises their hand or withdraws it, letting air to the area. Like many mice designed for serious gamers, it has a laser sensor so that sensitivity can be turned up high and programmable buttons. It costs $50 (\u00a334) via gaming hardware websites. The grips mean that the tool doesn't get slippery in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill (pictured) where the hand rests on the mouse . A video game fan coughed up blood and dropped dead in a Chinese internet cafe last month after playing World Of Warcraft for 19 consecutive hours without a break. Wu Tai, 24, went to the unnamed internet cafe in Shanghai to play the latest installment of the role-playing fantasy game alongside other fans of the popular series. CCTV footage shows him sitting in front of the computer and suddenly turning to his left to cough violently, before slumping in his chair and dying in front of shocked fellow gamers. Concerned onlookers called an ambulance for Mr Wu, who is understood to have continued playing the video game while waiting for the paramedics, despite clearly being seriously ill. Horrified fellow gamer Hsin Lo, 20, said: 'I called for an ambulance while my friend went to get some help from staff. But while we waited he just died in front of us, and was nothing for the staff to do,' Mr Hsin said. When medical crews arrived they tried to resuscitate Mr Wu but he was already dead.",

        "article": "(CNN)Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals. Believe it or not, Nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years. There has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in America in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal. Except, it happens all the time. Some have claimed this practice \"evokes a dark corner of American history\" where the mentally ill or \"deficient\" were forced to undergo sterilization. Yeah, that's true.  We did that.  And it was bad. Except this isn't quite that. Female sterilization is linked to the controversial \"eugenics\" movement, which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes. There is even a 1927 Supreme Court case, Buck v. Bell, in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and \"imbeciles,\" \"for the protection and health of the state,\" was constitutional.  The opinion in the case is stunning, especially because the Supreme Court has never technically overruled it. But Buck v. Bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities, not because they were being punished for a crime. You can hate sterilization, and the Tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics, but it's not that. Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment. Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down.  That's true too, sort of. In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual.  Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes. So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional? The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary.  We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad.  Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right?  Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it. Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.  This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal.  Shocked? You shouldn't be. As citizens, we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time.  You waive your Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer \"yes\" to an officer's \"Mind if I look in your trunk?\" You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk.  So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional? And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals? Nope. Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure. If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now?  Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced? There are really only two possibilities. First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news.  Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference. Most of the sterilization defendants are men. Search your feelings, Luke. When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right?  Be honest: Let go of your \"we're-all-equal-in-all-ways\" banner for a moment.  After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions. So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip.  It's OK.  You can admit it; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias, whether we like it or not. Still not convinced?  Watch this parlor trick: What if I suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor? So far you're not ruling it out. And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student? Most of our gut feelings shifted from \"maybe\" to \"no\" just now.  It's OK to admit that, too. Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again.  But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal. Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man.  Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a \"shocking\" news story, you must concede it fits. Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty?  Of course, we have to consider the related justification. Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women.  Just ask any domestic violence prosecutor. Are sterilization plea deals morally right?  It's hard to say.  For now, they appear to be constitutional, but controversial.  If we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child, should the government step in?  If so, to what degree?  Fortunately, we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now: just keep neutering the men.",

        "article": "A New Orleans couple bought a ramshackle historic cottage, moved it across the city and renovated it all the while using salvaged materials and respecting the home's original floor plan. Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought the the two-story 1840s Creole home from the Central City neighborhood after a church said they wanted to demolish it and expand their parking lot. The couple moved it to the Freret neighborhood where they then spent seven months renovating. Tillero and her husband Ensslen now live in the home with their two sons, six-year-old Santiago and nine-year-old Javier, as well as Tillero's mother, Olga Tillero. Scroll down for video . Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought this 1840s Creole cottage style home in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans almost two years ago . The couple then dismantled the home, moved it to the Freret neighborhood of the city and renovated the home while respecting the floor plan and using salvaged materials to decorate the home . To honor the home's original duplex floor plan while still creating a single-family home, Ensslen and Tillero put a massive wooden staircase between the kitchen and living room . The home is decorated with materials salvaged from other homes and salvage markets. The bookshelf on the right holding dishes was part of a house Ensslen restored in 1999 . This is what the Central City house looked like before Tillero and Ensslen bought up the house and moved it to the Freret neighborhood where it sits now . The original staircase in the home separated the building into a duplex. In the renovated home Tillero and Ensslen honored the staircase idea by putting a massive wooden staircase separating the kitchen from the living room . 'We bought the house to save the house - it was slated for demolition,' Ensslen told The Times-Picayune. 'I've always liked the Creole cottage style.' Ensslen, who's a historic renovation developer and organizer of the Freret Market and Freret Street Festival, and Tillero wanted to live outside Central City, so they bought the house before they had a lot to put it on. They ended up having to dismantle the structure and put it into storage. 'We had to dismantle it completely,' Ensslen said. 'It was a stack of lumber. We put it in a few dumpsters.' The dumpsters were stored on a secured lot near the city's Industrial Canal, where they sat for a year until the couple found a lot that fit the house's dimensions. Once they sorted how to rebuilt the cottage's floor plan and collected materials for its interior, they purchased a lot. They rebuilt and renovated the house in seven months. One of the kitchen walls is decorated with a series of hand-crank egg beaters, which Ensslen began collecting in the 1980s when he moved to New Orleans . All of the wood in the home was stripped of old paint and finished with linseed oil for a more golden touch in order to give it more character . The couple bought the home almost two years before they were able to live in it. It sat in storage for a year and then went through seven months of renovations . Once the couple found a lot that would fit the cottage's dimensions, they spent seven months renovating the home . Before the couple salvaged it, the kitchen's large island was a sewing table at an old department store. Its stove top is from the 1940s . Tillero and Ensslen's kitchen was kept simple, having the counter tops made out of poured concrete that was dyed black . For the kitchen cabinets and drawers, Ensslen used forks and spooks given to him by his parents when he moved to New Orleans . The cottage was originally a duplex, but Tillero and Ensslen decided to change the home into a single-home floor plan. They added an august floating staircase in the middle of the ground floor, to honor the split. 'What a lot of New Orleans charm is about is the millwork and doors and stuff,' Ensslen said. 'I'm glad we were able to have that.' The wooden staircase features a 20th-century iron railing that was salvaged from an old housing project in another neighborhood of New Orleans. It's anchored by beams that are camouflaged by a guest bathroom that sits between the living room and the kitchen. Antique lanterns light a tiny bathroom around the corner from the entryway and flooring of the house comes from wide pine planks that once were part of the roof, which was covered by tiles. 'Until recently, there was no plywood' for roof substructures, Ensslen said. Ensslen and Tillero bought the house after a church said they wanted to tear it down and expand its parking lot to that site . Through Ensslen's work with the Preservation Resource Center, he was able to negotiate a salvage instead of a demolition of the house . From the stairs of the two-story house, a person can see both the kitchen and the living room from above . The living room of the home features a coffee table made out of an old 'pedestrians crossing' street sign and wooden legs . Tillero and Ensslen live in the home with their two sons,\u00a0six-year-old Santiago and nine-year-old Javier, as well as Tillero's mother, Olga Tillero . The home features walk-through windows that raise from the ground and lead out to the cottage's massive front porch . The chest of drawers is one of the many recycled and salvaged pieces of furniture in the family's home. Ensslen and Tillero turned to artist friends to help decorate the cottage . The doors and mantels were stripped of old paint and finished with linseed oil for a more golden touch. 'The paint usually hides imperfections in the wood, but the nicks and bumps, they add more character, Ensslen said. The windows date back to before the house was purchased, before Tillero and Ensslen were married. When they were dating, Ensslen spotted the 'square, very masculine windows' at a salvage yard. 'I'd never seen anything like that.' After purchasing them they were stolen, but he got the one-of-a-kind windows back through his contacts int he salvage market industry. Tillero and Ensslen reached out to friends for interior decorating ideas. The living room features a tall built-in cabinet that was created out of wood from an old shed. A friend of the couple built the cabinet to accommodate Tillero, Ensslen and their two sons. Salvaged shutters are used as one wall of the room that Javier and Santiago share on the second floor. They seemed to have lined the shutters with ribbons they have received . Photos of Ensslen and Tillero with their sons Javier and Santiago decorate the walls of their bedroom in vintage white frames . Ensslen and Tillero's bedroom door was recycled from the old Maison Blanche department store chain in New Orleans . The door to the couple's bedroom was recycled from an old department store. Its door handle remains the same knob as the original door, marked with the Maison Blanche emblem . Another wall of the couple's room is lined with hats. Ensslen and Tillero wanted to rebuild their home on a lot that got plenty of natural light . Ensslen received these glass panels from his father who worked in a stained glass factory in New Jersey after a they 'didn't fit the client's spec' A key rack hanging in the home appears to be made out of old hooks and wood, along with recycled washers, chain links and wire . The massive, garage-door style cabinet fits a television, wine rack and cubbie holes for Javier and Santiago. Its wood, coincidentally, matches the colonial-style blue color of the kitchen walls - a paint the couple has held on to for 14 years and used in a previous home. Comic-book-style, custom-made decals line the walls of the sons' playroom, which has low desks that the kids can use for arts and crafts. The kitchen was kept simple, with counters made of black poured concrete that contrasts the bamboo and canvas blinds. A salvaged, brass-footed island sits in the middle of the kitchen. It used to be a sewing table at an old department store. As for the cabinets, the handles are created out of bent\u00a0utensils. And Ensslen says that the 1940s Tappan kitchen stove top is a highlight of of the house. Though it required a bit of rehabilitation, Ensslen claims 'it's the best stove ever'. Unused signage sits in the couple's driveway, waiting to be used for their next project. The couple plans to use it to create art to put in their home . Pots and signs line the driveway of the home. Ensslen and Tillero salvaged recycled materials from all over while renovating . The windows date back to before the house was purchased, before Tillero and Ensslen were married. When they were dating, Ensslen spotted the 'square, very masculine windows' at a salvage yard . The orange front door to the cottage stands out against the home's green, white and blue paint. Walk-through windows line the porch . The home sits in New Orleans's Freret neighborhood, where Ensslen is an organizer of the Freret Market and Freret Street Festival . The home features a foliage-covered front yard and two vintage cars sit in the driveway. Though it was originally a duplex, Ensslen and Tillero decided to turn the home into a single-family structure . Not only is the inside covered in art, but the outside features salvaged materials and art as well. A star-shaped sculpture created by Ensslen hangs on the side of the house .",

Victoria Police have confirmed it was located on Monday afternoon, west of the Devil\u2019s Cove and Candlebark campsite in Lake Eildon National Park - north-east of Melbourne. They are unsure when the beanie was dropped as the search for Luke continues. Scroll down for video . The Shambrook family with children (left to right) Luke, 11, Lauren, 7, and Matthew, 10 . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police remain hopeful they will find the boy who went missing from the campsite on Friday. An increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around Lake Eildon. On Sunday, search co-ordinator Acting Senior Sergeant Andrew Walker said Luke had a 'very high pain tolerance', a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days. 'Hence the reason why we\u2019re out searching. We\u2019re still hopeful that we can find him,' Sgt Walker said. The 11-year-old, who is\u00a0autistic, was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four\u00a0kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. A Victorian Police spokeswoman told AAP late on Sunday a family saw a young boy matching Luke's description while they were driving in the Devils River vicinity. A renewed sense of urgency has gripped the search efforts for the 11-year-old as temperatures have been dropping as low as eight degree Celsius in the area.

'The advice I'm getting from our search and rescue experts having regard to the overnight temperatures and the daytime temperatures is that he could well still be out there,' Sgt Walker said on Sunday. 'We've got to be realists but we're positive, the family's positive.' But Luke may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. A large search is being carried by a medley of search and rescue teams . Lake Eildon, near where Luke went missing: Police say conditions are favourable for his survival overnight, with warm temperatures through the day . Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland . Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Police hold hope Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's south-east, Opposition emergency services spokesman Brad Battin says it is devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He said Luke's parents Tim and Rachel had been updating him on the search and appreciated the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Searchers are desperately combing bushland and the banks of a lake for an autistic who went missing there . A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the dog squad and local police . Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday.

        "article": "The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\u2019",

Sharry was eight months pregnant. But then Smith fell and hit his head.  He was taken to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City.  Smith never recovered. \"July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,\" Sharry posted on Facebook.  \"I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child.\" Their son Taos arrived a few weeks later. When it was time for his 6-month pictures, Sharry had a special request. Maybe the photographer could make their family complete, just for one picture . \"They asked me if I would be willing to 'play around' with capturing their first family photo by editing Taos' daddy in one of their pictures,\" Kayli Rene' Photography posted on Facebook. \"I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,\" the new mom told CNN affilaite KOCO. The photographer wasn't sure it would work, but they found just the right picture of Smith -- one that has him looking over his family's shoulder. \"Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,\" Sharry said. The family photo has become a social media sensation after appearing on the photographer's Facebook page this week. It has some 193,000 likes and more than 24,000 shares. \"I can't believe she actually did this,\" Sharry said.  \"It's like amazing and apparently everyone else thinks it is too.\"",

        "article": "The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine. Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video . Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner . Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning . Pulled out: Crew member Luke Arbuckle shorted the jump as the two boats tilted away from each other and struck his head against the boat before being airlifted to the hospital . Ahoy: The 85-foot-long ship was on its way to St Maarten in the Caribbean with nine crew members on its first voyage of the season . The 24-year-old captain of the Liana's Ransom, Ryan Tilley, was the last crew member to depart the drifting ship, his father, Joseph Tilley, wrote on the ship's Facebook page. 'Seeing the ship crippled, damaged and left floating there as we motored away with the Coast Guard was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but you have to put lives first,' Ryan told WCVB. The boat was towed to  Kittery Point Yacht Yard in Eliot, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening where it will be repaired. The ship's website states the vessel was on its way to St Maarten, which was to be its new home port, when it lost engine power. The schooner, which has a 70-passenger capacity, was built to resemble ships used by privateers and pirates in the 1700s and is equipped with replica black powder cannons, according to the site.",

        "article": "A map that reveals every official sighting of a UFO over the past 76 years  suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before. Many of the sightings can be put down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies, but some enthusiasts believe it is because of rise in alien activity. The interactive map was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Click on the map below to find out if aliens have been spotted in your neighbourhood . A map shows sightings of extra-terrestrials around the world in the last 76 years \u2013 and seems to suggest we have more cosmic visitors than ever. It was\u00a0created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB . Published in the QuantBait website, it begins in 1933 with the first UFO sightings being spotted over California and Nebraska in the US, the UK and France in Europe, and locations in Japan and Australia. The number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world, according to the map. In the US, sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous Battle of Los Angeles and Roswell UFO Incident. On February 25 1942, radar operators spotted a UFO within 120 miles (193km)  of Los Angeles that moved at incredible speed before vanishing. The UFO map (pictured) was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s . Explanations for UFO sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves, and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies \u2013 or a genuine rise in alien activity. An illustration of a flying saucer is pictured . The map shows a dramatic rise in the number of UFO sightings during the 1950s and 1960s. While this could indicate ore alien activity, the CIA recently claimed that half of UFO sightings in the US were linked to them testing U2 spy planes (pictured) at altitudes of 60,000 ft . An artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25,000ft (7,620 metres) and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloon-shaped objects flying at around 200mph (320km/h). Fearing the city was under attack, officials fired at the aircraft but no evidence of damage was ever found, prompting people to speculate the UFOs were from another world. And in 1947 the Roswell Incident occurred, which is still the source of speculation today. The US military claimed they recovered a secret research balloon that had crashed, but conspiracy theorists say the wreckage of an alien craft was discovered and hidden. While it\u2019s possible that there were more UFO visitations during the decade, officials at the time put it down to people being nervous about World War II, and seeing objects in the sky. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, told MailOnline: \u2018Sightings of strange things in the sky have been reported for centuries, though it was only with them being labelled as flying saucers or UFOs that people began to realise that this is a worldwide phenomenon. \u2018UFO sightings often come in sudden and short-lived periods, which ufologists call flaps or waves. 'Often specific locations seem to be highly attractive to UFOs, and these locations are known as UFO window areas or UFO portals. The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights (UFO map of UK shown) Thanks to the rise in popularity of sci-fi films and an increase in UFO sightings, aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s. Here, Dr H Allen Hyneck, an astrophysicist at \u00a0Northwestern University says at a press conference in 1966, that a photo claiming to show a UFO is a time exposure of the crescent moon and the planet Venus . The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, which is next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reportedly saw unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights. But as they approached the 'craft', it moved away, frightening farm animals. The incident is unexplained, but some people say the lights were reflections from a nearby lighthouse and the craft may have been a secret weapon. On March 31, 1992, high speed white objects were spotted in the skies and an officer at RAF Cosford and Shawbury spotted a large triangular craft hovering at 200ft, which was humming and shining a spotlight. The incident was reported to the Ministry of Defence and sceptics say it could be explained by a nearby police tracking helicopter or a Russian rocket re-entering the atmosphere. \u2018In the UK, Warminster, Cannock Chase and Bonnybridge are the most famous UFO window areas.' Bonnybridge is known as the UFO capital of Scotland and there are said to be some 300 sightings every year, although not all of these are shown on the map. Cannock Chase in the Midlands has been a UFO hotbed since the1960s when there were first reports of a crashed craft, and earlier this year, residents reported seeing slow-moving aircraft making a loud buzzing noise moving across the sky. There appear to be repeated UFO sightings in the Midlands shown on the map during the 1960s, with clusters of activity also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and other parts of central Europe. There is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s, all across the US shown on the map. It is worth noting, however, that some famous sightings are missing, such as reports of flying saucers over Washington DC in 1952. Last year, the CIA took credit for half of the UFO reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as sci-fi films gained popularity such as Invaders from Mars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it\u2019s possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before. The CIA said that UFO sightings were directly correlated to them testing U2 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft (18,288 metres) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before. Reports suggest that the CIA soon realised that UFO sightings lined up with the place and time the U-2 planes were flying, but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps. However, this does not explain the 1966 Westall Encounter in Australia, when some 200 students and teachers in Melbourne claim to\u00a0have\u00a0seen a UFO land in a suburban field, before taking off again. But\u00a0once again, sceptics\u00a0say the UFO was an experimental military aircraft. The map also shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, which showed up on radar. The mysterious flying objects disappeared when fighter jets gave chase, leading some people to say the UFOs were technically-superior alien craft. However, a British space researcher called Geoffrey Perry claimed that the UFOs were actually pieces of debris thrown out of the Soviet space station, Salyut-7, which burned up in the atmosphere,\u00a0Stylist\u00a0reported. In Europe, the map shows many sightings over Belgium, between 1989 and 1990, which is known as the Belgium Wave. At that time, some 13,500 people claimed to have seen huge black triangles flying silently through the skies. While the incident was tracked by Nato radar and investigated by the country's military, nothing unusual was found and sceptics believe the sightings may have been of ordinary helicopters. From the mid-1990s onwards, the explosion of sightings intensify on the map, with large concentrations over the West Coast and the whole eastern half of the US, from Texas. The map shows the whole of Europe ablaze with circles indicating UFO sightings, as well as areas of western Africa, India, South East Asia and South America. Some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before (UFO map focused on Australia pictured) The map shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, as well as numerous sightings in South Africa and other parts of the continent, which have been reported in recent years. UFO maps of South America (left) and Africa (right) are shown . The global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before. Mr Watson said: \u2018With the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report UFO sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings. \u2018We should also acknowledge that Chinese lanterns and the increased deployment of drones are responsible for greater amounts of sightings.\u2019 In 2008, a guard at Yeni Kent Compound in Turkey claimed to have filmed UFOs and the footage is said by some to be among the most important UFO images. There is no explanation for the encounter, in a similar way to a sighting in Warden in South Africa, where a police officer said he saw an enormous oval-shaped, orange light in 2000. In 2007, eyewitnesses in Kolkata, India said they saw a fast-moving, glowing \u00a0object which was a cross between a sphere and a triangle. And in 2013, in Bracknell, Berkshire, two glowing 'flying saucers' were photographed hovering in the skies above a pub and new of 'visitors' quickly spread online. John Wickman, Chairman of the British UFO Association (Bufora) said: 'Technology is vastly progressing and a very large number of sightings no matter where they are in the world can be attributed to modern military craft that have been misidentified.' \u2018Just because a UFO report is made does not mean that the object originates from anywhere other than the Earth,\u2019 he cautioned. Mr Watson said: \u2018On the other hand, the internet allows access to greater amounts of information and enables us to discuss reports from lots of different angles, from the extreme sceptical viewpoints to the most outlandish conspiracy rumours. \u2018With or without the internet, ufologists tend to think that only five to 10 per cent of sightings are of anything exotic and worthy of further investigation.\u2019",

Stephanie Scott (right), pictured with her fianc\u00e9 Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday . 'More importantly though, we have each other,' the post continues. 'Rest assured, if you stumble or fall, you will do so into the safe hands of many who care about you.' 'At other times, your hands could be needed and we know you will be there.' 'For Steph. For our school. For our town. For each other.' The high school was the last known location of Ms Scott before the 26-year-old went missing on Easter Sunday - less than a week before her wedding to fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. The drama and English teacher returned to the school alone that day to preparing lessons for the teachers who would replace her while she was on her honeymoon. Instead tragedy struck and the 26-year-old's body was found by police in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, the following Friday afternoon. On the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance\u00a0Aaron Leeson-Woolley a memorial was held. Her body was tragically found the day before . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service on the day he had been due to marry the love of his life, Stephanie Scott . Stephanie Scott's sister Robyn commented on Leeton High School's Facebook post on Sunday evening, addressing a beautiful message to the students who meant so much to her sister. 'Just remember what my beautiful sister Stephanie loved. Teaching all you amazing students and seeing your smiling faces,' wrote Robyn. 'You are the ones who made her want to be the most amazing teacher, friend and person she could be. 'Be strong, Leeton. For Steph. And know she will be with you all in spirit as I know she is with her family and friends. Xxxxxxxxx.' The school has made counselling services available for students and held 'community support coffee mornings' to help bring staff, students and parents together during the school holidays. 'A community united grows stronger,' the school vowed. A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English .

        "article": "A Russian submarine close to the coast of Britain may have dragged a trawler violently backwards after snagging in its nets, a fishermen's organisation has claimed. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland and the vessel was badly damaged. Ardglass is one of Northern Ireland's main fishing ports and local trawlermen are usually more concerned about hitting their quotas than Cold War-style intrigue. Violently dragged: Captain Paul Murphy\u00a0of the\u00a0Karen, a fishing trawler, holds up a snapped steel cable aboard his boat. The damage is thought to have been caused by a Russian submarine . The incident happened off the coast of Northern Ireland and is the second time in two months that fishermen have reported being dragged by a suspected submarine (file picture) The 60-foot boat's captain Paul Murphy was pictured holding a snapped steel cable on board his boat following the alarming incident. Nato exercises were held this week in northern Scotland and Ardglass fishing representative Dick James said the alliance's drills may have attracted Russian interest. This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft near UK air space, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Mr James said: 'Our defence forces are not up to much if a rogue submarine of unidentified nationality is tearing around the Irish Sea.' Last month a trawler captain claimed his boat was nearly dragged down by a Russian submarine while fishing off the Scottish coast. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland . Alarming episode: The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident and was badly damaged . The trawler's captain Paul Murphy points to an on-board computerised tracking system that shows his boat's unusual movements during the incident . Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius. The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it. Recently Russian warships reportedly used the English Channel en route to military exercises in the North Atlantic. The coastguard said the Karen reported a collision at a point known as the Calf of Man not far from the Isle of Man. The skipper said the boat had been snagged and dragged backwards at speed. Mr James added: 'You don't need to go long at that until you go under.' The four crew members scrambled to release wires connecting the net to the out-of-control trawler, which had been moving slowly forward but was suddenly sent careering backwards through the water. As the ship steadied the shaken seamen stopped to catch their breath but there was no sign of the cause. The vessel made its way back to Ardglass and part of the deck had to be lifted because it was so badly damaged, and another section was ripped off. Mr James added: 'It is a bl***y mess.' He said Royal Navy protocols mean an incident like this would not happen involving a British submarine. He said: 'It is possible that it was a Russian submarine. Another recent alert: This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft, believed to be 'Bear' bombers, (stock image) near UK air space . No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression . 'You cannot always prevent it but if an incident like this did happen the (Royal Navy) protocols said that the submarine would immediately surface to check on the health and welfare of the people involved and this one did not. 'Paul Murphy, the skipper, said that he sat for five to 10 minutes catching his breath to see if the submarine would surface. 'It was a submarine, it had to be, it could not have been anything else.' The incident came as Britain hosted a Nato exercise in northern Scotland involving more than 50 warships. Separately, the MoD has said RAF Typhoons, from RAF Lossiemouth, were deployed 'after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK air space'. It said it could not comment on Royal Navy submarine movements or the fishing vessel incident. Tensions over the Ukraine conflict have soured relations between the West and Russia, which is suffering from US and EU sanctions imposed because the Kremlin is backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. A map showing how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth on Monday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Mr James, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers' Organisation, said: 'There has been Russian activity. There have been Allied exercises going on, the Russians have been taking an interest in it. 'The question mark now is what kind of a submarine was it? 'If it was Allied it should have been following an agreed protocol where this should not have happened.' Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Assembly member Chris Hazzard said the community was angry. He said: 'The fact that this submarine didn't even surface to make sure the fishermen were safe has caused considerable resentment in the area. It is totally unacceptable that a submarine would show such contempt for maritime workers. 'The skipper and his crew on the Karen, and indeed all of the local fleet, deserve to know the truth about what happened. 'Whether this is a British vessel attached to the hugely controversial Trident system or a Nato submarine in training, our local fishermen deserve justice.'",

        "article": "The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City \u2013 who have slumped to fourth in the league \u2013 are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a \u00a312million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack\u00a0Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and\u00a0Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with \u00a3100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at \u00a350m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, \u00a360m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost \u00a3200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major\u00a0contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross\u00a0Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of \u00a360m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players. MANCHESTER CITY . Association-trained homegrown players: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Gael Clichy, James Milner, Frank Lampard. Club-trained homegrown player: Dedryck Boyata .",

        "article": "Cate McGregor was surprised when she was unconditionally backed by the cricket community and the Australian Army. But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six. It took less than an hour for the federal Liberal leader to call Ms McGregor after she forwarded the chapter of her book that outed her. Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him \"your party won't be thrilled about this\",' she said, the ABC reports. However the senior military official did not express the same kind of appraisal when it came to Mr Abbott's stance on same-sex marriage, saying she is 'sad' that he is not a supporter of it. Scroll down for video . Cate McGregor - now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force - spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman. She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.' Mr Abbott sits with Ms McGregor to commentate during the International tour match between the Prime Minister's XI and England at Manuka Oval in Canberra last year . The senior officer addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series . McGregor a senior officer knows she's 'benefited enormously' from male privilege. But she'd willingly sacrifice it all to have lived as a woman from her early 20s. The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series. At times, she became tearful. But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'",

        "article": "A new vaccine to stimulate the body's immune system could offer a cure for HIV. The 'kick and kill' strategy aims to eradicate the virus, by stimulating the immune system - the body's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine. Researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant HIV hiding in white blood cells with a chemical 'kick', allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells. The theory, developed by researchers at University College London, the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina, is based on a single patient case study. Scientists hope a new 'kick and kill' vaccine could flush out HIV hidden in the body before stimulating a person's own immune system to kill the cells . 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails,' study co-author Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said. 'We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines, but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce.' The study looked at a single 59-year-old man in London who was an 'elite controller' - meaning his immune system could control HIV for a long period of time without his needing treatment. Elite controllers, who make up 0.3 per cent of HIV patients, eventually require treatment to prevent progression to AIDS. But they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against HIV. The patient in the study had both HIV and myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. The bone marrow produces white blood cells, including those that help to control HIV. Pioneering new treatments for HIV, flu, ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man-made DNA. Experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial DNA, each mimicking a different killer disease, and inject them into patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them. Inovio, one of the companies behind the technique, has begun trials in humans, after strong results in the lab. The American company is using the method to attack flu, ebola and certain types of cancer \u2013 as well as HIV and hepatitis. Experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer. To treat the patient's myeloma, his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells. When the bone marrow was removed, the immune system was severely impaired, allowing the HIV to re-activate and replicate. This caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system's function returned. When the patient's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant, the levels of HIV in his bloodstream rapidly fell. His immune system reduced HIV levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available, bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks. Professor Deenan Pillay, also of UCL, said: 'By measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual, we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment. 'We also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection. 'This is a single patient study, but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the HIV disease process.' The man was not given any anti-HIV drugs, due to concerns about side-effects affecting his cancer treatment. The researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the HIV completely, however they state that is far from certain. Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said: 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails. We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce' 'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.' Dr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body. 'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller. 'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.' The study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.",

        "article": "Instead of enjoying a conventional honeymoon after his wedding on Saturday Andy Murray will be heading to Barcelona next week for a training block that has now taken on a much increased significance. For in the wake of Amelie Mauresmo's announcement that she is pregnant, the world No 3's trial with his prospective assistant coach Jonas Bjorkman has assumed a greater importance. Mauresmo, who is to give birth some time in August, will be around eight months' pregnant during Wimbledon this summer, which is not finishing until July 12 due to the new three week gap between Roland Garros and The Championships. Andy Murray celebrates taking a set against Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open . The British No 1 is set to marry his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday . Therefore Bjorkman is likely to have a key part to play as Murray attempts to regain his title at SW19 \u2013 something which, given his improved form during the first part of the season and his prowess on grass, is well within his reach this year. Beyond that the 43 year-old Swede may also come into his own, as it is unclear how this will affect Mauresmo's 26 week per year commitment to the Scot, which is almost exclusively spent on the road. She also has the part-time job of being Captain of the French Fed Cup team, who are in action next weekend. Mauresmo has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her, and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board. Already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the US Open which begins at the end of the August, although there has been no comment on this from either her or Murray, who has been up in Scotland ahead of tying the knot with Kim Sears in Dunblane. Murray's current coach Amelie Mauresmo has recently announced that she is expecting a baby . Mauresmo, pictured at this year's Australian Open, may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birth . It is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman \u2013 the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 \u2013 prior to that. As Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move. A personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game, and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability, he was someone the Scot identified as prime coaching material. Murray has been planning to work with former world No 3 Jonas Bjorkman as an assistant coach . The Swede, pictured winning Wimbledon with Todd Woodbridge, is a former world No 1 doubles player . Last week in Miami Murray reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together, and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with Sweden's version of Strictly Come Dancing. 'The time flew by,' the British No 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation. It would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along, or if he did not fit in with others in the team, including Mauresmo. Just where this leaves the player and his 35 year-old head coach will be for the two of them to work out. The softly-spoken Mauresmo is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things, let alone on matters to do with her personal life. Bjorkman could have a key part to play in Murray's quest to reclaim the Wimbledon title he won in 2013 . She is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with Murray to Australia and America this year, who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible. However pleased Murray will be for his coach on a personal basis \u2013 and there is no question they have become very close \u2013 he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team. His form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season, and Bjorkman appeared to be the last piece slotting into place. Now the Swede could find himself with a bigger role than was initially bargained for.",

        "article": "This little bear cub has picked a comfy place to take an afternoon nap so shouldn't be grizzly when he wakes up. The heartwarming scenes, captured by professional photographer Denis Budkov, 35, during a trip to Kuril Lake in Kamchatka, in Russia, show the animal family have bear-ly a concern in the world as they play and snooze in the sunshine. He sat and watched as the mother, who was also already lying on the banks of the lake,- became a makeshift sofa for one of her playful cubs. Time to get up: One cub wakes up while the other bear-ly stirs as they are snapped after they take a nap on banks of a lake in Russia . Protector: The massive mother bear takes a look over her shoulder as one of her cubs puts a tiny paw on her side, hopeful of a cuddle . The photographer spent hours watching the young family from a safe distance - with the normally ferocious animals appearing comfortable with his presence. 'I noticed this family - a mum with two cubs. Then after a while, I noticed something unusual, which I had never seen before - the cub climbed onto his mother like a chair,' he said. 'He looked very comfortable, and stayed there for nearly half an hour. The mother looked less impressed, but seemed so tired from looking after her energetic babies that she just stayed put.' Play time: The family of bears splash around in lake\u00a0Kamchatka. One cub reaches out to the mum who lovingly looks back at her brood . Snuggle time: One bear cub takes a comfortable nap on the back of his mother as she lies by on the bank of a lake in Russia . Heartwarming: One of the cubs clambers on to the mother's back, with water from their dip in the lake clearly visible as they enjoy the sunshine . The bear family are part of a huge population found in the Kronotsky Reserve - known as the Kingdom of bears - thanks to its huge population of the animals. The bears are guarded by the state to prevent illegal poaching and hunting - meaning the bears are more friendly towards humans without the threat of violence. 'Though we should understand that bears are very dangerous animals, with them being probably one of the most unpredictable and emotionless creatures, the bears here are pretty friendly. 'They are used to people and understand that people will not do them harm. As long as you respect them and nature, they put on incredible shows of nature at its best and most raw.' Hard life: All three bears settle down for a nap after spending time playing in the calm waters of Kuril Lake in Kamchatka .

        "article": "Ed Miliband today rushed to Scotland to try to shore up his hope of becoming Prime Minister as a damning poll showed almost half of Scots are ready to back the SNP. The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by \u00a32 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional \u00a32 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending.\u00a0They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 . Ms Sturgeon joined with local candidate Steven Paterson while on the campaign trail in Stirling . The latest poll results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted' Mr Miliband pledged: 'I will never sell Scotland short by signing up to the SNP's plans. And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'",

According to TMZ, the prenup between the Food Network star and the Law And Order: SVU actress provides her with the relatively\u00a0meager\u00a0sum for five years. The report also claims that the prenup contains a clause that allows the chef buy her out of the $8million marital home for just $1million - with an extra $50,000 to pack and move her stuff. Unhappy: Stephanie March is unhappy with the $5,000 a month she has been offered by Bobby Flay as per their prenup, according to TMZ; He filed for divorce on Friday (pictured in June 2013) Flay filed for divorce on Friday, just one day after it emerged he had separated from his wife of ten years. TMZ claimed\u00a0the 50-year-old was 'heartbroken' about the split - while his wife is 'mighty unhappy' with the prenup. Also on Friday the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0claimed the actress questioned her spouse about rumours he was romantically involved with Mad Men star January Jones in 2010. 'I know Stephanie basically asked him after January Jones, \"Did you f*** her?\"' an insider told the site. March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March . Her love interest these days:\u00a0Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth . Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.' It has been reported they separated three weeks ago. And because they have no children together there is no issue about child support but they are fighting over property already, it was alleged on Friday. Flay has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago, pictured in January 2013 . TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day. Stephanie claimed Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment . Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009 . In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993.

        "article": "The orchid is one of the most unique and instantly recognisable flowers in the world. It has evolved a so-called lip - a large and irregular modified petal, to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known, until now. Researchers have found that its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins and by tweaking them, they can convert this lip into a standard petal. The orchid (an example of which is pictured) has evolved a so-called lip - a large and irregular modified petal, to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known, until now . The study, published in the journal Nature Plants, extends scientists' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the diverse beauty of orchid flowers. There are between 21,950 and 26,049 accepted species of Orchid, most of which have a large and irregular modified petal, called the lip, in addition to three 'normal' petals. The structure of orchids is unique among floral plants. They also have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre which is used during reproduction. Researchers have found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins. They converted lips into petals in two orchid species by\u00a0reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing (illustrated) Conversion of lips into sepal/petal-like structures in Oncidium and Phalaenopsis orchids is shown . Orchids have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre. Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, researchers  from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals. The have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it. The experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing. Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. Lips are differently coloured, ruffled or pouch-shaped, depending on the species, and can be decorated with horns, hairs, warts, teeth and tails to attract specific pollinators. These range from bees to flies, gnats, moths, butterflies, hummingbirds and even bats in some tropical climates. To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, Chang-Hsien Yang and his colleagues from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.

The scientists studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They\u00a0found that in mature orchid flowers,  two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex (red) and the 'SP' complex (blue), compete to form the lip and petals. This competition and balancing act is illustrated above . The pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century. It was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey. But earlier this year, scientists suggested that the mantis doesn't simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves. It was popularly thought that the orchid mantis (pictured), whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey . Dr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi. First, his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own. For a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers. However, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. 'We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,' Dr O'Hanlon said. When paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. Here, an orchid mantis eats a Tiger heliconian butterfly in Malaysia . They also found that mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers, but selected leaves to sit on, just as often. Sitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity. When they compared the mantis's shape and colour with flowers from an insect's perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a 'generalised' flower. They may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain. The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower \u2013 and the predator uses 'sensory exploitation' to catch its victims. Sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate \u2013 to its doom.",

But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter (24.1 per cent) from the year before, bringing the value of sales down by 19.3 per cent to \u00a314.5million. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year. The product used to be a favourite of many celebrities including Victoria Beckham (left) and Sam Faiers (right) Georgia Percy, of retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, which gathered the data, said it suggests women are \u2018tending towards a more natural look\u2019. She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. Fake tanning had become part of many women\u2019s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast \u2013 both male and female \u2013 of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: \u2018Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!\u2019 Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman\u2019s Own event last year.

Locations in Ceredigion, Powys and Pembrokeshire are also being used to radicalise Muslims, according to an officer from the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit. Those involved in such activities 'take part in seemingly ordinary activities' in the community but 'have an ulterior motive', Detective Constable Gareth Jones said.

Speaking to Ceredigion Council, DC Jones stressed that issues surrounding terrorism were not confined to large cities. Incidents of Islamic extremist activity in Wales can be traced back to 1998, when it is claimed hate preacher Abu Hamza sent a group of 10 extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons, in Powys. The area is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged terrain helps prepare soldiers, including elite forces personnel like the SAS, physically and mentally for warfare. In 2005, two of the 7/7 bombers,\u00a0Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer,\u00a0were photographed white water rafting at the National Whitewater Centre in Bala, North Wales.

        "article": "St Mirren skipper Steven Thompson has apologised to team-mate John McGinn after accidentally spearing him with a training ground pole. The Scotland Under 21 player is now on crutches and will miss the rest of the season after a prank at Saints' Renfrewshire training ground went badly wrong on Thursday. Gary Teale's first-team squad were doing a dribbling drill when veteran Thompson lost possession to McGinn and stumbled into two poles which were intended for the players to run through. St Mirren's Steven Thompson acidentally speared team-mate John McGinn with a pole in training last week . McGinn (left) will miss the rest of the season after being stabbed in the leg by the pole . Thompson threw one at McGinn in jest \u2013 and to his horror it stabbed him on the leg, leaving him requiring hospital attention. Thompson subsequently scored two goals in Saints 4-1 win over Kilmarnock on Saturday and is believed to have given his win bonus to his stricken team-mate. But on Sunday night the striker was still coming to terms with injuring one of the club's brightest talents in such a bizarre manner. 'The whole thing has been a complete nightmare,' Thompson said. 'John is going to be okay but I'm mortified that it happened in the first place. I was having a carry-on and it turned sour. 'It was a stupid prank, something silly, and it ended with John being injured. I can't apologise enough.' Thompson netted his 50th goal for his boyhood heroes at the weekend. But he insists it's been impossible to get the training ground incident out of his mind. Thompson celebrates the first of his two goals against Kilmarnock in Saturday's 4-1 victory . 'It's all I've been able to think about since it happened on Thursday,' he added. 'I feel so bad. It was an accident but it's still something I regret. 'We were doing a drill where, to score goals, we had to dribble between two poles which were sticking in the ground as gates. 'When I got to a set of poles John tackled me and one of the poles got stuck between my legs. 'It sounds stupid now but for banter I grabbed one of the poles and pretended I was doing some kind of Ninja move. 'I threw it into the ground behind John who, by this point, was running away and facing in the other direction. 'But as I did that, he did a Cruyff turn and the pole stabbed him in the leg. We were only a few feet apart. It wasn't as if I launched it 10 metres like a javelin. He was right next to me. St Mirren boss Gary Teale shakes hands with his captain Thompson on the touchline at St Mirren Park . 'I just hadn't counted on him changing direction when he did.' Thompson could only watch in horror at what unfolded. 'It was just horrendous,' he said. 'It was the worst thing I have seen in my life. Since then it's all I've been thinking about. 'It popped in and out of his thigh instantly and for a few seconds his leg was black. But then blood started pouring out of the hole. 'John was obviously in agony. A few of us carried him inside and he got treatment. It was horrendous. 'I've been shocked by it and really down. I like a laugh and a joke in training but for this to happen is just unbelievable. 'Saturday was a big day for me but all I'm thinking about is John.'",

        "article": "She's just days away from giving birth but, as ever, the Duchess of Cambridge refused to let her style icon status slip during her second pregnancy. Rather than  swaddling her growing bump  under baggy dresses, the 33-year-old dressed to impress every time she stepped out. But while Mulberry coats and Alexander McQueen gowns did creep in, much of Kate's pregnancy wardrobe came from the High Street. Scroll down for video . Favourites: Hobbs, Seraphine and ASOS have all been worn repeatedly during the pregancy . From a \u00a335 ASOS polka-dot dress to  Seraphine shifts, the Duchess is proof that you don't have to splash out to look gorgeous while expecting. Leading the High Street charge to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe is Hobbs, a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours. So enamoured is Kate of the brand, even Zara, of which she was once a die-hard fan, has had to make way for it, although another budget favourite, L.K Bennett, \u00a0also remains a favourite. 'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post-baby, and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin. Hobbs: A \u00a3160 shirt dress (left) in January and, right, in a peplum top at a Place2Be event in November . 'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' The Duchess wore a brown shirt dress from Hobbs to visit foster carers in North London in January and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November. On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum effect. But while she championed Hobbs on several occasions during her second pregnancy, it is by no means the only high street staple in Kate's wardrobe. Spot the Duchess! Kate in a \u00a3169 Hobbs Dalmatian coat in March that was first seen in 2013, right . The brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small Anglo-French label called S\u00e9raphine, which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today. The Duchess is the brand's most famous fan, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies. Along with a \u00a3195 coat worn in January and a \u00a395 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the Potteries in February, she also opted for the brand when making her d\u00e9but in New York. On that occasion, it was the glamorous \u00a3225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly. S\u00e9raphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud, who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington, and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement. In March, on a visit to ITV drama Downton Abbey, Kate wore a chic cream coat from high street maternity label, JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9. She has also sported a shirt dress from Jaeger and \u00a399 print dress by Alice Temperley during her pregnancy. Cosy: Kate in a \u00a3275 Seraphine Maternity Marina coat with Prince William in New York in December last year . S\u00e9raphine: Kate in a \u00a3195 coat in January and, right, wearing a \u00a359 Vanessa dress in December . Thanks to the much-marked Kate effect, everything she has worn has swiftly sold out. 'One of the reasons for her enduring sartorial popularity is the accessibility of her wardrobe,' explains Glazin. 'It's very real. Very practical. People can relate to her through her wardrobe, which is a clever move from her and her people. 'Nothing is out of reach, and she does wear a lot from the British High Street, which is great to see. It allows people to copy her head-to-toe. People want her hair, her make-up and now her wardrobe. 'People want someone to look up to when it comes to the royals. She is the new generation. 'She, more than any other royal, has made fashion achievable for the public. Diana had an amazing wardrobe but she wore a lot of made-to-measure pieces. 'She's quite safe with her wardrobe, which makes it even more accessible.' Good look: Kate wore a \u00a3250 blue Jaegar tile-print shirt dress in a video message supporting mental health .

        "article": "Tara Reid's boyfriend was reportedly fired from his high-flying job at a health insurance firm for cheating them out of more than $100,000 by wasting their money on his company credit card. Aaron Kaufman, the former chief technology officer of Blue Shield, has been accused by his former employer of blowing thousands of dollars on vacations, hotel stays and lavish nights out with Reid. Blue Shield also mentioned Reid in their complaint, saying that at one event bankrolled by Kaufman's card she 'behaved inappropriately' by posting raunchy images of herself at the event to social media. Splashing the cash: Aaron Kaufman (left) is accused of blowing more than $100,000 on his company credit card by former employers Blue Shield, a health insurance firm. A lawsuit company spells out several cases of alleged overspending, including one where his girlfriend Tara Reid posted 'inappropriate' pictures (right) 'Employees were embarrassed': Blue Shield claimed that Miss Reid's antics upset fellow workers - and also set the company back $879 - part of an alleged $100,000 unjustifiable spending spree . According to a legal complaint, seen by the LA Times, Reid caused a 'great disturbance' by uploading images of herself at a San Francisco bowling alley in early January. The pictures appear to correspond with bikini pictures Reid put on her Instagram page dated January 7th this year where she flaunts her body while sitting in front of one of the lanes. Reid, 39, shot to fame on the back of roles in The Big Lebowski and American Pie, and now features in the overblown Sharknado franchise. Blue Shield was billed $879.84 for the night, according to the suit. Of the event, it said: 'At some point during the evening, Mr. Kaufman's girlfriend acted inappropriately, taking inappropriate photographs of herself and sharing them. 'Word of the behavior at the bowling alley event spread quickly at Blue Shield and caused a great disturbance within the company. Employees were embarrassed.' Luxury: Pictured is the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia, where Kaufman is accused of spending $832 of Blue Shield's money on a single night with Reid . The company also alleges tens of thousands of dollars in other inappropriate spending - including a $17,491 vacation in Florida to see Reid. The two were dating despite Kaufman being married to another woman. Other listings in the more than $100,000 total include a night with Reid at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which cost $832. He is also accused of running up a tab of $1,382 on drinks at the Warwick nightclub in Hollywood. He also spent $832 for one night at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with Reid on Jan. 21, according to the company. Three weeks later, he ran up a corporate tab of $1,382 on drinks at the Warwick, a Hollywood nightclub, they claim. In total the company says that three quarters of his spending on the corporate card had no obvious business purpose, and that even legitimately spending was excessively lavish. Big spender: The company has also accused him of running up a $1,382 bar tab at the Warwick nightclub in Hollywood, pictured . The company is seeking the money back as well as unspecified damages. It is not clear what Kaufman's regular salary at Blue Shield was - but an earlier lawsuit he filed against Blue Shield claimed he was due an annual bonus of $450,000, implying his regular pay was larger still. According to Blue Shield, when confronted about the spending, Kaufman defended himself by saying his cash was 'locked up' his bank account and credit cards because the two were going through a divorce. Kaufman originally picked the legal fight with Blue Shield. A previous LA Times\u00a0report from the start of April said that Kaufman sued them first, claiming he had been wrongly fired one day before his bonus was due. According to that suit, the dispute was punishment after Kaufman stood up to his bosses for wasting money. Blue Shield denies the allegations. Reid had not spoken publicly about her relationship with Kaufman, but has referenced an unnamed boyfriend in social media posts.",

        "article": "When the Queen, then aged 86, was filmed 'jumping out of a plane' during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, no one was more surprised than her grandson, Prince William. Describing her as an 'unbelievably good sport', he added: \u00a0'Harry got a sniff of a rumour on the night and the rumour mill was going into overdrive. 'But, in fact, she did such a good performance that she's been asked to star in the next Bond film. I'm thrilled for her.' Scroll down for video . Birthday: The Queen, pictured at Newbury Racecourse on Saturday, is celebrating her 89th birthday today . While the Queen's cameo role as a Bond girl came as a surprise to her grandsons, her still-sharp sense of fun did not and, as she turns 89, it's one that shows no sign of diminishing. Just last week, she was spotted looking animated and crossing her fingers at the Newbury Races while cheering on her filly, Ring of Truth. Although the two-year-old bay only managed second place, the Queen, who still goes to the races whenever she can, clearly enjoyed herself. Her Majesty is also a regular rider and is frequently spotted riding out in Windsor Great Park on her black Fell pony Carltonlima Emma - despite, as she turns 89, reaching an age where most other riders have hung up their hats for good. Sense of humour: The Queen proved her sense of humour remains undiminished with her James Bond spoof . Active: The Queen still rides regularly and is pictured out in Windsor Great Park last week . Long-standing love: The Queen, pictured in 1968 and 1972, has long adored all things equestrian . But the Queen is an expert when it comes to defying her advancing years and, along with maintaining a schedule that would leave people a third of her age exhausted, continues to enjoy herself much as she always has. Although recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback - the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Her Majesty also puts in regular appearances at the Windsor Horse Show and is frequently seen watching the action during the Cartier Polo Cup - a tournament that takes place at the Guards' Polo Club in Windsor. Although, unlike her grandsons William and Harry, the Queen has never played polo herself, she has long been a fan of the sport. Showing her nerves: The Queen grimaces while watching her filly Ring of Truth last week . Shared love: The Duke of Edinburgh also shares her love of racing and polo . Popular: While the Queen cannot ride as much as she'd like, she still has a heavy work schedule . But while her advancing age has curtailed the Queen's ability to ride, she still partakes in many of the habits picked up as a young woman, among them a penchant for a pre-lunch gin and Dubonnet. Like her mother, who lived to be 102, Her Majesty is also said to be fond of a pre-dinner gin and tonic but turns down fancy fare in favour of plainer dishes. According to former royal chef Darren Brady, a typical lunch for Her Majesty is grilled Dover Sole served with wilted greens - that followed by an afternoon tea with 'at least two kinds of sandwiches' at four. For supper, the Queen has more fish or game such as pheasant sent to Windsor from her estate at Sandringham or Balmoral. Perhaps this hearty but plain fare explains her continuing good health and her ability to manage what remains a heavy workload . Meetings: She meets the British PM once a week and 'regularly speaks' to those elsewhere . Role: The Queen performing her role as Queen of Australia with a visit to an Aboriginal culture show in 2002 . State opening: The Queen, here as Queen of New Zealand, opening Parliament in Wellington in 1977 . Patriotic: The Queen, here of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, meeting children in Hampshire . Her Majesty  spends most afternoons welcoming incoming ambassadors to Buckingham Palace, presiding over investitures or, as she did last week, taking part in visits on behalf of one of the 16 countries of which she is head of state. She also has a weekly audience with the UK prime minister, currently David Cameron, and 'speaks regularly' to the prime ministers of the 15 other countries where she is head of state, among them Australia's Tony Abbott and Canada's Stephen Harper. Under the Queen, the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology, including social media. The Queen is currently the world's most followed royal, with her account, @BritishMonarchy, followed by 970,000 people. Her first post, an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the Science Museum, went viral - as did her first photo-bomb. The moment, which came during last summer's Commonwealth Games, saw Her Majesty appear in the background of a selfie being taken by Hockeyroos player, Jayde Taylor, 30. Her Majesty also made her first, if unscheduled, appearance in a selfie in June when 14-year-old Jack Surgenor darted in for a cheeky snap during a walkabout in Belfast's St. George's Market. Photo-bomb! This snap of the Queen by Australian hockey player Jayde Taylor rapidly went viral . First selfie: 14-year-old Jack Surgenor snaps a cheeky selfie with the Queen during a visit in Belfast . First Tweet: The Queen sends her first official Twitter message during a visit to the Science Museum . Beyond selfies and social media, the Queen continues to make waves in the sartorial world with her trademark shift dresses and colourful coats, all of which are regularly referenced by the world's top designers. Even her Launer London handbags are enjoying renewed popularity, with the brand regularly selling out colourful special edition versions of her favourite \u00a31,075 Traviata style. At home, her family are enjoying a period of relative peace and, as she celebrates her 89th birthday, the Queen is about to become a great-grandmother for the fifth time. But for Her Majesty, who is spending today privately with her family at Windsor Castle, the imminent arrival is just one of a number of reasons to be pleased. Still riding, still enjoying the races and still unafraid to surprise family and the public alike, the Queen, nearly ninety, surely is the world's coolest great-grandmother.

        "article": "British agents spied on Argentina until 2011 over fears it would try to reclaim the Falklands Islands, former CIA worker Edward Snowden has claimed. Documents released by the American whistleblower allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. Documents released by Edward Snowden (pictured) claim Britain was spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011, according to media reports there . The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands, which they refer to as 'Malvinas' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Snowden now lives in Russia having fled the US via Hong Kong after revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence. The revelations come in the wake of already heightened tensions with the discovery of oil in the Falklands by the British last week on what was the 33rd anniversary of the battle. Britain struck oil in the Falklands last week, a discovery likely to escalate tensions with Argentina. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Britain has already pledged \u00a3180million over the next 10 years to beef up its defences of the Falklands to take into account 'any future and possible threats' to the islands. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the remote, wind-swept islands from Spain when it gained independence. Britain argues it has historically ruled the islands and the islanders should have the right to self-determination. In a 2013 referendum, 99.8 per cent voted to remain a British overseas territory. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by Britain's oil find. After nine months of exploratory drilling, a group of British companies found oil and gas at the Zebedee exploratory well, in the north of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. In a sign of worsening relations, Argentine foreign ministry officials say they will prosecute oil companies operating near the Falklands. The officials claim companies active there are operating illegally in Argentine territory. A war veteran and relatives sing the national anthem during a ceremony remembering the Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands war in Buenos Aires . Argentina says it has a right to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, because it inherited them from the Spanish crown in the early 1800s . Kirchner\u00a0used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' The Argentine President poses with war veterans during the ceremony that paid tribute to fallen soldiers . Kirchner throws a rose into the water to honour the soldiers who fell during the 1982 Falklands conflict . The South American state still claims territorial rights to the remote, wind-swept islands from Spain when it gained independence . On April 2 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a remote UK colony in the South Atlantic. This led to a brief, but bitter conflict. Argentina's military junta hoped to restore its support at a time of economic crisis, by reclaiming sovereignty of the islands. It said it had inherited them from Spain in the 1800s and they were close to South America. The UK, which had ruled the islands  for 150 years, quickly chose to fight. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the 1,800 Falklanders were 'of British tradition and stock'. In the fighting that followed, 655 Argentine and 255 British servicemen lost their lives, as did three Falkland Islanders. In recent weeks, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned of a 'very live threat' from Buenos Aires. To stave off Argentinian aggression, he pledged to pump \u00a3180million into defending the islands over the next decade. The money will be spent on the upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez condemned the move and said Britain should spend more helping its own poor instead. Delivering a speech to honour her country's war dead in the conflict, she said: 'What a paradox when there are more than one million Britons eating at the food banks they have had to open in one of the most powerful countries in the world. 'Don't worry. Don't spend another pound sterling on defending the Malvinas. 'Spend your money feeding the English, on providing jobs for your young people and a better quality of life for the British, because we are not a threat to anyone.' In a bold statement, she added: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking.' She has also ordered the declassification of all her country's secret documents on the war. Last year, the Top Gear cast and crew were chased out of Argentina by mobs angered by a H982 FKL licence plate on Jeremy Clarkson's Porsche. The host, who was recently sacked from his role at the BBC, feared 'lives were at stake' as he sheltered with fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond while an angry gang of locals rampaged through the building looking for them. The BBC crew was hounded out of the country as locals claimed the controversial licence plate referred to the 1982 conflict, inflaming long-running tensions.",

Ms Schake, 45, who has worked as chief communications officer at L'Oreal USA for the past two years, has been brought on to Mrs Clinton's 2016 communications team to help recast her image. She will attempt to turn the 67-year-old politician - who is expected to  announce her run for White House this month - from a strong and knowledgeable figure into a softer, more accessible one, according to the New York Times.

Image makeover: Former White House aide Kristina Schake (left), who left the East Wing in June 2013, is reportedly behind the drive to get \u00a0ex=secretary of state, Hillary Clinton (right), elected president next year . Accessible personality: Ms Schake helped to transform U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama's public image into that of an all-American 'everywoman' who even performed 'mom dancing' with Jimmy Fallon in 2013 (above) The former persona, experts have said, could have hampered Mrs Clinton's 2008 presidential contest against President Barack Obama, who came across as cool and amiable with voters. The latter persona, meanwhile, has worked wonders for\u00a0Mrs Obama, who has become a national emblem of healthier eating with her legislative push for more fruit and vegetables in school meals. As Obama noted in 2008, Mrs Clinton must show voters that she is more than just 'likeable enough' - by displaying a warm and funny side that, according to her friends, reflects her true character. But, Ms Schake's efforts to help Mrs Clinton do this could prove tricky - particularly in the wake of the scandal over her new boss's exclusive use of a personal email address while secretary of state. A U.S. House committee is currently seeking a private interview with Mrs Clinton over her use of the private address, as well as a personal computer server, during her time at the State Department. Ms Schake's attempts could also be hindered by some voters' views that the politician and her husband Bill - parents to daughter Chelsea - are detached from the issues of 'normal' Americans. Scandal: Ms Schake's efforts to help Mrs Clinton do this could prove tricky - particularly in the wake of the scandal over her new boss's exclusive use of a personal email address during her time as secretary of state . 'True self': As Obama noted in 2008, Mrs Clinton (seen listening to an instructor reading a story to children at a Firststep NYC session in Brooklyn on Wednesday) must show she is more than just 'likeable enough' The couple have reportedly amassed more than $100million since leaving the White House in 2000, and continue to command speaking fees of a whopping $200,000 or more, according to the Times. They also have multiple homes, including one in Washington DC and one in Chappaqua, New York . To counter Mrs Clinton's apparent inaccessibility, Ms Schake, whose work with Mrs Obama helped to turn her into an\u00a0online\u00a0video star and magazine cover model, could draw on the politician's hobbies. She could get Mrs Clinton to speak about her passion for swimming, as reported by\u00a0ABC,\u00a0or appear at a charity swimming gala. She could also fix up celebrity partnerships like she did with Mrs Obama. The multitude of new ways to reach voters means 'it\u2019s not the same formula in politics that it was even just four years ago or eight years ago,'  Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist, told The Times. Undercover: During her time as an aide for Mrs Obama, Ms Schake encouraged the current First Lady to shop undercover at a Target (pictured) in Alexandria, Virginia, dressed in a floral blouse and a baseball cap . Presenter: Ms Schake's work also led to Mrs Obama presenting the best picture award alongside Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson at the Academy Awards in February 2013. The trophy was given to the film, Argo . The deputy campaign manager for the Obama reelection campaign added: 'It\u2019s about understanding people who are just living their lives and figuring out ways to fit a candidate into that', not vice versa. During her time as an aide for Mrs Obama, Ms Schake encouraged the current First Lady to shop undercover at a Target in Alexandria, Virginia, dressed in a floral blouse and a baseball cap. The widely-reported trip was\u00a0intended to her portray the 51-year-old - who has two daughters, Sasha and Malia, with her husband - as an ordinary mom, keen to make savings for her family. Successful: Ms Schake (pictured), who previously co-owned a LA-based PR firm that handled media relations for Maria Shriver, is the daughter of a stay-at-home mother and a commercial airline pilot . Ms Schake's work also led to Mrs Obama\u00a0presenting the best picture award alongside Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson at the Academy Awards in February 2013, according to the Washington Post. And she encouraged the First Lady to invite children to the White House to help harvest the summer crop from the House's kitchen garden in 2013 - an event that was photographed by the world's press. The adviser, from California, 'did a really great job of keeping Mrs Obama at the forefront of the conversation but in a way that continued her ability to be accessible and relatable,' Ms Schake's predecessor Camille Johnston told the newspaper, adding: 'No small feat during a presidential election cycle.' Indeed, Ms Schake's 'feat' saw Mrs Obama feature on the front covers of both Vogue  (twice) and Better Homes & Gardens magazine. Ultimately, it turned her into an 'accessible everywoman', the Times reported. And Ms Schake's impact is still apparent today - this week, an energetic Mrs Obama performed a second installment of 'Evolution of the Mom Dance' on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Her performance came  two years after she took part in her original 'Mom Dancing' skit with Fallon, which was encouraged by Ms Schake and gained more than 22million views on YouTube. It marked the five-year anniversary of her Let's Move! initiative to fight childhood obesity in America. Ms Schake, who previously co-owned a Los Angeles-based PR firm that handled media relations for Maria Shriver, is the daughter of a stay-at-home mother and an airline pilot, it is reported. She was the\u00a0co-founder and board member of the American Foundation for Equal Rights - the nonprofit group that filed the successful federal lawsuit against California's ban on gay marriage, . She currently lives with her boyfriend, an Albanian journalist. After Ms Schake left the White House in 2013, Maria Cristina 'MC' Gonzalez Noguera, 39, was hired as the Obamas' communications director. Fitness initaitive: Mrs Obama participates in a yoga class during a visit to the Gwen Cherry Park NFL/YET Center as she celebrates the fourth Anniversary of Let's Move on February 25, 2014 in Miami, Florida . Mrs Obama tweeted The Chew this week, encouraging the show to participate in her #GimmeFive challenge . On Friday, it was revealed that Mrs Clinton has signed a lease in a Brooklyn, New York, building for what is expected to house her campaign headquarters, according to a person familiar with the plans. Mrs Clinton has reportedly signed the lease for two floors in an office in New York's Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The anonymous person was not authorized to speak publicly about internal planning. The decision to sign the lease - which was first reported by Politico - likely sets off a 15-day period in which presidential candidates are required to make their intentions officially known. The building, One Pierrepont Plaza, also houses the U.S. attorney's office of Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to be President Barack Obama's next attorney general.

        "article": "A pregnant model whose sexy selfies featuring her tight abs turned her into an overnight internet sensation has given birth to a healthy baby boy. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday afternoon. And despite her critics' claims that her unusually trim figure could be damage to to her unborn child, it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah confirmed to E! that baby James weighed in at a healthy eight pounds, seven ounces and was 22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' Scroll down for video . Ready to go: Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'. \u00a0The 30-year-old gave birth to a healthy baby boy named James Hunter the next day . Feeling hungry: Sarah shared this photo of two In-N-Out burgers on Tuesday afternoon, although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth . An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be harmful to her unborn child, their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. Almost there: Sarah cradled her baby bump to in a 'sexy' purple dress to celebrate her 39th week of pregnancy . 'Yesterday afternoon, Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong\u00a0underwear has been liked nearly 40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during her ninth month of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. So soon: Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although now it seems that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Stylish mom: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'",

        "article": "The owner of the East Village building that blew up last week and left two dead people could yet face criminal charges, it has emerged. Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Locon, 26, both died when the Manhattan apartment building collapsed last Thursday following a massive blast. Investigators have now shifted their focus to what caused the explosion, with suggestions someone may have improperly tapped a gas line serving one of the buildings. Scroll down for video . The clean up continued yesterday at the site where several buildings collapsed following the ferocious blaze . A crane removes large pieces of debris as firefighters watch on from the roof of a neighbouring building . Firefighters watch the clean up continue at the site of the explosion which killed two people . In August utility workers discovered the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, it has emerged . Nicholas Figueroa (left) was killed in the explosion while on a date, while Moises Lucon (right) worked at the restaurant and was identified yesterday as the second victim . The New York Post reported an investigation is now underway into possible gas tapping, with a criminal case expanded to include Haria Hrynenko, the building's landlord. Sources told the paper possible charges include second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment. The explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village set alight the property, while its neighboring buildings, 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue, were also engulfed before all three buildings completely collapsed to the ground, leaving a massive hole on the corner of the block at 7th Street. The medical examiner yesterday confirmed the identity of the second victim using DNA analysis as that of restaurant worker Moises Locon. He had been working six days a week and his family said during his free time he enjoyed taking his nephew to a Queens park. He was reported missing after the explosion and his body found days later. Another 22 people were injured. Meanwhile, in August, utility workers had discovered that the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, according to Consolidated Edison. Firefighters battle the flames following the explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village last week . The off-duty first responder reached the ground just in time, because just moments later the fire intensified . Horror: Looking towards the fire from Astor Place, flames could be seen reaching into the sky . The discovery led Con Edison to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe, the utility said. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before last week's explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used and then leaving, it was claimed. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, Con Ed President Craig Ivey said. Fifteen minutes later, the sushi restaurant's owner smelled gas and called the landlord, who called the general contractor, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. No one called emergency dispatch or Con Ed. The contractor, Dilber Kukic, and the owner's son went into the basement and opened a door, and then the explosion happened, burning their faces, Boyce said. Kukic - who's facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the circumstances surrounding the explosion. Firefighters continued to blast water at pockets of flames among the rubble the following day . Photographs taken on Friday showed three buildings entirely collapsed following the explosion . The city's mayor said it could take up to a week for the rubble to be cleared from the explosion site .",

Mum Gitte Denteneer asked staff at the Rubens eaterie in Leuven, Belgium, to warm up some milk for her two-month old son Lucca. But when she came to pay, she was stunned to find that 50 cents had been added onto the bill.

        "article": "Two soldiers, one a Buckingham Palace guard, walked free from court yesterday despite inflicting a shocking beating on a helpless civilian. During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character. Richard Herrmann, defending him, said: \u2018But for that night this man is an angel, but on that night he was a devil.\u2019 Captain James Dyson said Smith had \u2018picked himself up\u2019 since and \u2018is proving to be one of the best performing people in his platoon\u2019. Outside court Detective Constable Andy Palmer said: \u2018This is the most violent piece of CCTV footage I have seen in ten years as a police officer and it is extremely fortunate the victims were not more seriously injured. This case highlights the horrors of alcohol-fuelled violence.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN)Americans on the United States' no-fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department this week. The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). \"After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again.\" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list. Now, they'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress, with an option to request further information. \"The U.S. government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response, identifying \"specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List,\" according to the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided \"to the extent feasible, consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake,\" court papers said. Those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge.",

The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year with most of the victims, high school students. Thousands of protesters met in the capital Seoul to call on officials to raise the\u00a0Sewol after senior government officials said they would 'consider it.' Scroll down for video . One year on:\u00a0Relatives of the victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people a year ago and other civic members shout slogans during a rally in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday . A total of 295 bodies were recovered from the ferry, and nine victims remained unaccounted for when divers finally called off the dangerous search of its interior last November. The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests with hundreds of bereaved parents, many with their heads shaved and clad in white mourning robes, marching 22 miles to Seoul from their home town of Ansan last week. President Park Geun-Hye has pledged to 'actively consider' raising the Sewol, taking into account the opinions of the relatives and salvage experts. But senior government officials said the salvage operation would cost \u00a368million . Senior ministry official Yeon Yeong-Jin said: 'And that is only an estimate, as the final cost would be greatly dependent on weather conditions, technological uncertainties.' Protest: Demonstrators holding placards calling on the government to salvage the Sewol ferry in Seoul . Stricken: Rescue operations saved some of the passengers on a South Korean ferry Sewol that capsized on its way to Jeju island from Incheon, but 300 perished in the tragedy . The tragedy sparked nationwide grief and outrage as it became clear that regulatory failings, official incompetence and the ship's illegal redesign were the main causes. Park's administration was widely criticised for its response to the disaster, and her approval ratings have only just begun to recover. After months of political bickering, parliament passed a bill in November initiating an independent investigation into the sinking. But relatives have accused the government of trying to influence the probe by appointing officials to key posts in the 17-member inquiry committee. Unrest: Demonstrators clash with police officer\u00a0while trying to march to the presidential Blue House after a rally in Seoul . Emotional: Protesters clash with police while a woman weeps while holding a placard calling on the government to salvage the wreck, one year after it sank killing 250 students . Wreck:\u00a0People are calling on the South Korean government to raise the stricken Sewol at an estimated cost of \u00a368 million . More than 50 people have been put on trial on charges linked to the disaster, including 15 crew members who were among the first to climb into lifeboats. The Sewol's captain was jailed in November for 36 years for gross negligence and dereliction of duty, while three other senior crew members were sentenced to jail terms of between 15 and 30 years.",

        "article": "Winter weary New Yorkers have been given a timely reminder that Spring has finally sprung. Smokey Da Lamb has been turning heads in some of the city's coolest neighborhoods ever since restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34, and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24, adopted him. But now the couple - and Smokey's impressive legion of fans - have been left devastated after city officials demanded he is taken out of the metropolis. Scroll down for video . Happy family:\u00a0Restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34 (R), and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24 (L), adopted Smokey Da Lamb after he was abandoned by his mother . Lamb and the City: Smokey has made dozens of friends during his month-long stay in New York, however city officials are now demanding that he be sent back to live on the farm . At home: The young lamb has been living with Sandy in his Lower East Side apartment, and the couple have been providing him with round-the-clock care and attention . 'Unfortunately Smokey has got to go back to the farm \u2013 we're not allowed to keep a lamb in the city,' Maxine said. 'I'll be sad to see him go because he's so loving but we're officially adopting him which means he will never end up on a dinner plate. 'We'll visit as often as we can \u2013 Sandy has even taken lamb off the menu at his restaurant The Black Tree, in tribute to Smokey. 'Smokey has caused a few disasters while he's been here but he's a farmyard animal so it's to be expected. 'We're still going to miss him hugely.' Devotion: Maxine (pictured) and Sandy bottle-feed Smokey three times a day and have to burp him after he has eaten . Friendly face: Smokey has been growing quickly since arriving in the city - and is much more confident than he was when he first moved into Sandy's apartment . Accidents do happen: Maxine admitted that Smokey is a bit like a 'dog which has not been potty trained' She added: 'Everybody should own a lamb \u2013 he is great and so loving. 'I guess he's like a dog which has not been potty trained.' Smokey was born at Violet Hill Farm in upstate New York but was abandoned by his mother and would have likely died in the cold. Fortunately Sandy, who runs Manhattan-based restaurant Black Tree, agreed to take him in when contacted by the farmer and Smokey was smuggled into his tiny apartment in the city's Lower East Side . 'Sandy told me that he had adopted a lamb and I said he was crazy \u2013 we couldn't look after a lamb,' Maxine explained. Something for everyone: The couple believe that everybody should get the chance to own a lamb . Crazy: When Sandy first told Maxine that he had adopted a lamb from a farm in upstate New York, she admits she thought the idea was ridiculous . Change of heart: 'When I saw him my heart melted,' Maxine admits . Keep clean: In addition to his regular bottle feeds, Maxine and Sandy have to bathe Smokey regularly, ensuring that they only use water so that his fleece doesn't shrink . 'But when I saw him my heart melted - he was so cute. 'He must have been around 3 or 4 pounds and was wearing a little diaper with his tail sticking out. He was so sweet and loving.' Smokey is bottle-fed three times a day and needs to be burped like a baby after he has had his formula. He needs regular baths and can only be washed with water so his fleece does not shrink. Maxine added: 'We take him out for regular walks in the park \u2013 he really loves that. Restaurant revolution: Since adopting Smokey, Sandy has removed all lamb dishes from the menu at his Manhattan restaurant,\u00a0Black Tree . Take a seat: Often Smokey will spend time with restaurant-goers, keeping them entertained while they wait for their food . Fan club: The people of New York have quickly fallen in love with Smokey's charming personality . Let me take a selfie! Smokey has quickly become a social media star; almost everyone who meets him wants to snap a picture with the popular pet . 'Smokey never needs a lead because he just likes to follow us around. 'In many ways he's better than a dog but I've never known a dog that needs to be bottle fed \u2013 or who poops and pees so much. 'Whenever I stay at Sandy's apartment I will sleep in the bed and Sandy will sleep in the living room with Smokey. 'We can't let him in the bedroom because he will make a big mess in there. 'People in the city love him, it's hard to get too far when you have Smokey with you. They'll do double takes then run back to stroke him and take pictures \u2013 he's so popular.'",

        "article": "One problem with space travel is that humans aren\u2019t very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time. But one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity. Scroll down for video . A Washington, DC-based company called United Space Structures wants to create a new space station. Their giant cylinder (shown, with the ISS and Space Shuttles illustrated) could apparently replace the ISS. It would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity, and would be 1,300ft (400 metres) long, cost \u00a3200 billion ($300 billion) and take 30 years to build . The \u2018space mushroom\u2019 was designed by Bill Kemp and Ted Maziejka from United Space Structures\u00a0(USS), based in Washington, DC. The final design would be 330ft (100 metres) in diameter and 1,310ft (400 metres) long. \u2022 Orbiting Hotel/Casino/3D Sports Arena . \u2022 Orbiting space station - Planetary environmental monitoring/Research . \u2022 Solar system space vehicle . \u2022 Settlement cargo vehicle & construction platform . \u2022 Rescue vehicle . \u2022 Continuously looping space ferry system . \u2022 Mining vehicle/platform . \u2022 Manufacturing platform . \u2022 Bio-medical research/manufacturing . Artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4.22 times per minute around its vertical axis, creating downward pressure via the centrifugal force to keep objects - including humans - on the floor. The force would be the same as the gravity experienced on Earth. Meanwhile on the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in \u2018zero-gravity\u2019. While the main cylindrical body would spin in one direction, the top dome-shaped section would spin in the other direction. This would allow spacecraft to dock with the top of the station, which would appear stationary to them.\u00a0The necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom-like appearance. The dome would house the command centre for the station, and also many of the supplies needed for the crew on board. \u2018We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space,\u2019 Mr Kemp told MailOnline. To build the station, the team says they have \u2018patents pending\u2019 for six robotic systems that can manufacture and construct a variety of structures in space. While exact details aren\u2019t known at the moment, another company - Tethers Unlimited -  has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their SpiderFab proposal, a system of robo-spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit, although Mr Kemp told MailOnline that the USS method would be 'different'. Mr Kemp added that, for this large structure, it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to \u00a3200 billion ($300 billion). For comparison, it took more than 10 years to build the ISS, at a cost of around \u00a367 million ($100 billion) - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume. And it would be \u2018large enough to transport all the people and equipment required to set up a colony on Mars and would orbit Mars and provide a safe environment while the Mars base is being constructed.\u2019 Artificial gravity has been considered many times before, most famously in the 'Stanford Torus' design (interior seen here). A rotating station would allow people to live as if they were walking on Earth, allowing them to stay in space for long periods of time . To build the station, something like SpiderFab (left) could be used, a proposed system of robo-spiders than can construct solar panels, trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit. On the right is an artificial gravity test Nasa performed in September 1966. The Gemini 11 spacecraft was attached to an Agena target vehicle and spun, with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft . On the ISS, the station is in constant freefall towards Earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in \u2018zero-gravity\u2019. However, they actually still experience about 90 per cent of Earth's gravity, but the constant falling makes them seem weightless . Inside, the structures would be spinning so anyone on the curved \u2018floors\u2019 around the edges would be pushed into the ground, simulating gravity on Earth. But Mr Kemp said they want to build a smaller structure first, to prove the design works. \u2018Our first structure will be 30 metres [100ft] in diameter, it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people,\u2019 he said. This smaller structure would cost between \u00a33.5 and \u00a37 billion ($5 and $10 billion), and could be built in the next 10 years. It would take just 12 to 18 months to build, according to Mr Kemp. \u2018The International Space Station is estimated to be decommissioned around 2024,\u2019 Mr Kemp noted. The team has yet to begin any serious construction or testing as of yet - so at the moment, the station remains somewhat of a pipe dream. Astronauts on the ISS (Terry Virts seen left, Scott Kelly on the right) live in a constant state of micro-gravity. Mr Kelly is spending a year on the ISS to see what effects such conditions have on the human body for a prolonged period of time . In the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, astronauts are shown running around a spacecraft that spins (shown) while on a mission to deep space, creating artificial gravity for them to operate in . Previous concepts for spacecraft include this 1969 station that would rotate on its central axis to produce artificial gravity. The majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board . However, space settlement expert Al Globus, who is also\u00a0a contract scientist at Nasa's Ames research centre, told MailOnline that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space. \u2018Rotation to provide artificial gravity will counteract most, if not all, of the negative effects of micro-g,\u2019 he said. And he says if we truly want to live in space, including raising children there, it will be necessary to create such a station. \u2018There is no data on the effects of micro-g on kids, but it is safe to assume they will grow up very weak as muscles and bones develop in response to stress,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Thus, for settlement, there is simply no question that they must rotate and almost certainly need to provide 1g at least for the first few generations.\u2019 But whether this station will be the answer remains to be seen. Several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a Nasa concept called Nautilus-X - but as of yet, there are no concrete plans by Nasa, Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) or any other nation on what to do after the ISS. Whether this station by United Space Structures or another concept will be built, remains to be seen. Nasa's Nautilus-X concept, shown, includes a doughtnut-shaped spinning section in the middle where astronauts can experience artificial gravity. The spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon, Mars or beyond . While a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity, astronauts will still have to contend with zero-gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space. Shown are Nasa's Robert L. Curbeam, Jr. (left) and Esa's Christer Fuglesang above New Zealand in 2006 .",

Arsenal's Daniel Valencia is dismissed by German Delfino after appearing to handle the ball in the area . Linesman Ivan Nunez\u00a0caught a replay of the incident on a nearby cameraman's monitor and informed Delfino . Delfino overturned the decision  - to the annoyance of Velez who lost out on a penalty and a man advantage . Despite  the correct decision being awarded by the referee - replays showed  striker Mariano Pavone was the handball offender and the frontman was subsequently booked - Velez were left fuming after the penalty was overturned and Valencia was allowed to return to the field. Video technology is not allowed in Argentine football and, after a melee ensued on the pitch involving players and coaching staff, Velez manager Miguel Angel Russo said: 'Delfino has every right to change his decision.

        "article": "A Scottish castle commandeered by Winston Churchill to help prepare troops for the D-Day landings has gone on sale for \u00a31.75million. The 19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for landing at a beach and was commissioned as HMS Brontosaurus in 1942. Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was deemed an ideal training ground for thousands of British troops. Soldiers practised beach landings - complete with bombs, smokescreens and strafing fighters - jumping from landing craft and clambering up the beach in preparation for the events of June 6, 1944, in Normandy. For sale: Castle Toward, near Dunoon, which played a crucial but little-known role in defeating the Nazis, has gone on the market for \u00a31.75m . Training ground:\u00a0Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was used as a training base for D-Day . Danger: The training at the grounds was very realistic and incredibly demanding - many servicemen were killing during exercises . Allied soldiers would spend a week of intensive training at the castle, which included swimming in full kit and daily exercises on the surrounding hills. Brontosaurus was visited by both Churchill and Supreme Allied Commander Lord Mountbatten during this time. The training was so realistic and demanding that many servicemen were killed in accidents. The castle's rich military history is still clear to see. One room is named after Churchill and the foundations of the huts built to accommodate visiting troops still stand in parts of the grounds. Preparations: The grounds of the 19th century castle on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute was used to ready troops for D-Day . Deep waters: Swimming training saw the forces jump off the pier and they then had to wade to shore in full military gear . Army base: Troops were stationed at the castle, where they trained off the coast of Scotland, in preparation for the D-Day landings of 1944 . Camp: With easy access to the sloping shoreline, Castle Toward was a perfect place to train troops in amphibious warfare . Historic: The D-Day landings on June 6, 1944,\u00a0led to the liberation of France from Nazi control, and contributed to an Allied victory in the war . Timings: The Normandy landings were originally scheduled to take place in May - then postponed until June and put off again at the last minute for 24 hours due to bad weather . Across the UK, troops took part in various military exercises in preparation for D-Day. In late 1943 the war cabinet had agreed to the building of an assault training centre on the south Devon coast, and 3,000 civilians in six villages were ordered to leave their homes. The first large training exercises - on the south Devon coast at Slapton Sands \u2013 revealed communications problems, lack of mission comprehension, poor crisis management abilities and a general sense of chaos. On April 28, 1944, 749 US soldiers and sailors died after three ships involved in a training exercise were ambushed by German torpedo. Exercise Tiger was one of the biggest full-scale rehearsals before D-day, involving all 23,000 US soldiers who were planning to land on the Normandy beach codenamed Utah. Slapton Sands had been chosen because of its similarity to the French beach. Apart from the Devon and Scotland coastline, training also took place at Camp Gordon Johnston near Carrabelle, Florida. Mr Jepson, of the Combined Operations Association, said the troops stationed at the castle were planning for a return to mainland Europe. He said it was essential the different branches of the forces - army, navy and air - learned to work together for the return to France. He said: 'They had to start from scratch and start planning for the return to France. They started the combined service centres where they planned the actual landings. 'Of course they had very little to start off with. They developed various crafts and weapons.' Speaking about the conditions for the troops at Brontosaurus, he explained: 'They were under a lot of pressure. Sadly there were a lot of accidents and a lot of people were killed. 'With the ramp down they would jump into what they thought was shallow water and some drowned.' 'Swimming training would see them jump off the pier and swim to shore in full kit.' He said the RAF would at times fly over the Scottish beaches dropping bombs and smoke screens. 'It had to be as realistic as possible,' he said. 'It must have been an amazing site with the landing crafts, ships and tanks coming and going.' Talking about Castle Toward he said: 'It was ideal where it was. It's a beautiful building and historically important.' Castle Toward was built in 1820 by\u00a0Kirkman Finlay, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, as his family's country house. Following its use by the Allied Forces, the estate was bought\u00a0by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1946 and was used as an educational facility. Its ownership passed to Argyll and Bute Council in 1996 after local government reorganisation and the authority has been trying to sell the estate for the past few years. It has only been put on the open market after plans for a community buyout were rejected by the council after it only offered \u00a3850,000. The castle includes 25 bedrooms, six reception rooms and extensive grounds with stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon. On the market: The castle, which is being sold by estate agents,\u00a0Baird Lumsden, contains 12 shower rooms and an observation tower . Historic: The castle offers stunning views\u00a0over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon and is set within 125 acres of land . Picturesque:\u00a0The property enjoys fine views over the Clydeestuary towards the Isles of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae .",

        "article": "US officials are expected to stop prosecuting families of American hostages who communicate with kidnappers abroad or raise funds and pay ransoms. A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to\u00a0CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.' It was unclear what sort of advice the family received from US government officials. Diane Foley welcomed the potential policy shift, which officials discussed with her last week. 'There's a lot that needs to be fixed,' she told ABC News. She said the past threats were 'the straw that broke the camel's back. It was incredible.' A number of hostage families expressed outrage after US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Haqqani Network in Pakistan a year ago in exchange for the release of five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison.

        "article": "Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''",

        "article": "The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office falsified the training and firearms records of the millionaire reserve deputy who shot dead an unarmed suspect by mistake, claim sources within the department. They allege that at least three of 73-year-old Robert Bates' supervisors were removed from their posts when they refused to sign off on forged field training hours - and that he was not fit to police the streets. The allegations of corruption published in the Tulsa World come after claims the wealthy CEO 'paid to play cop', which ultimately led to the events of April 2 when he fired his handgun instead of his Taser, killing 44-year-old Eric Harris. Scroll Down for Video . Allegations of corruption: Robert Bates, (right), arrives at the Tulsa County Jail with his attorney, Clark Brewster on Tuesday . The shocking claims come in the same week that Bates turned himself to face charges of second-degree manslaughter for Harris' death. Charged: Robert Bates is free on $25,000 bail and is charged with second-degree manslaughter for the death of Eric Harris on April 2 . The sources who spoke to Tulsa World claim that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. The office claims that the deputy who certified Bates has now moved on to work for the Secret Service. 'We can't find the records that she supposedly turned in,' said Glanz according to the Tulsa World. 'So we are going to talk to her to find out if for sure he's been qualified with those weapons.' The Tulsa World have said that they heard 'almost immediately' after the shooting that Bates was allegedly not qualified to be a deputy and that his records had been pushed through the office. The Tulsa World claims to have seen a whole list of the courses that Bates got credit for, but the names of his supervisors have been redacted - a practice they said they had never seen for a public official in Oklahoma. Charged: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (left, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy . Redacted: These are the official records of Robert Bates' training - which the Tulsa World is claiming have been beefed up . One of the reporters at the paper told CNN that they are demanding the office turn over the names. 'You would think the sheriff's office, if in fact there has been no pressure applied, no falsification of records, that they would be forthcoming with these documents,' she told CNN's 'New Day.' 'We've asked for them. They've said they don't believe they're public records.' Undersheriff Tim Albin has vehemently denied that the records that qualify Bates are false. 'The training record speaks for itself. I have absolutely no knowledge of what you are talking about,' Albin said to Tulsa World. 'There aren't any secrets in law enforcement. Zero. Those types of issues would have come up.' Bates, who shot dead Harris during a botched undercover operation after a brief struggle is currently free on $25,000 bail. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Video from the incident reveals that as soon as Bates realized he had shot Harris he dropped his gun and immediately said, 'Oh I shot him! I'm sorry.' Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. The Harris family legal team say they believe these traning records are a lie and do not exist. Indeed, already questions have been raised as to the authenticity of Bates' records. The Sheriff's Office have previously said that Bates joined the force in 2008, but when he was asked he said he joined in 2007. In his statement to the Tulsa investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. The corruption allegations come as it emerged that Bates contributed $2,500 to Sheriff Glanz's re-election campaign and that he has donated vehicles and video to the office. However, Glanz has denied that Bates 'paid to play a cop'. 'No matter how you cut it up, Deputy Bates met all the criteria on the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to be in the role that he was in,' he said to CNN.",

Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed\u00a0Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny:\u00a0Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn\u2019t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \"Oh my God that\u2019s my face.\" 'I can\u2019t remember the number of times I said \"this is so freaky\". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence.

        "article": "Walter Scott and his passenger were looking forward to having a cookout when he was pulled over and shot dead by a South Carolina police officer, it has emerged. Scott, 50, and Pierre Fulton, his friend of several years, had met for breakfast on April 4 before Scott drove him to a church so Fulton could collect a bag of vegetables. He then took Fulton home to drop off the bag there before they both headed over to Scott's house. 'They were heading to Walter Scott's house to eventually have a cookout that afternoon,' said Fulton's attorney, Mark Peper. But as they returned home, their car was pulled over for a broken tail light in North Charleston. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Pierre Fulton is 'torn up' about the death of his friend, Walter Scott, on April 4, his attorney has said. The two men were heading to Scott's home on April 4 for a cookout when Scott was killed by a cop . Killed: Scott, 50, ran from his car when he was pulled over by North Charleston officer Michael Slager, right, for a broken tail light. As he ran away, Slager shot the father-of-four multiple times, killing him . Scott jumped out of the car fled the scene - and was shot multiple times in the back by officer Michael Slager in a horrifying incident captured on a passerby's cell phone camera. Peper said that his client did not know why Scott ran from the car but that he said there was no confrontation. Following the stop 'there was never a conversation between Pierre and Walter regarding the reason for the stop, what his intentions were - anything along those lines,' Peper said. Scott was behind $18,000 in his child support payments and family members have said he may have run because he was worried about going to jail. Scott, who is black, ran away and a video showed Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at Scott. Fleeing: A dash cam video still provided by the North Charleston Police Department shows Scott leaving his car after a traffic stop on April 4. His passenger said he does not know why Scott fled . Gunned down: A passerby captured this video of Slager shooting Scott dead as he tried to flee the scene . Fulton said he heard the crackle of a Taser and shots fired. From where Scott's car was parked, his client could see Slager chase after Scott but did not see him get shot, Peper said. 'As they turned the corner, he wasn't able to see anything that occurred,' he said. And while his client heard the Taser followed by the gunshots, 'he doesn't recall the timing or how many seconds between it. All that's a bit foggy', he said. Peper said his client has also given a statement to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Family members said earlier that two were headed to an auto parts store at the time of the shooting. Peper said they may have had errands planned but his client said they were eventually heading to Scott's house. He said his client has asked for privacy so he can deal with the death of his friend. Saying goodbye:\u00a0Pallbearers walk Scott's casket to his grave for his burial service on Saturday . Sadness: His heartbroken mother, Judy, is pictured leaving her son's funeral in Charleston last weekend . Fight: Activist Cornel West (center) joins protesters against police violence in Manhattan on April 14 . 'He is torn up. He is a mess,' Peper added to ABC News. 'He hasn't been able to talk to anybody about this.' The father-of-four's death sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after the witness' video contradicted the police account of the event. Slager, 33, had said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott during a confrontation over his Taser, but the footage revealed the civilian running away before he was shot. Scott was laid to rest last weekend. His casket was draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother, Judy. Slager has been later charged with murder and fired from the police department. He has yet to enter a plea.",

        "article": "Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip. In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia . As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer . And closer . The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick . As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered . It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu -\u00a0whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot .",

The 19-year-old, speaking during an interview in May's issue of Inside United, added that he would want Robin van Persie's movement and Radamel Falcao's instincts. The United starlet said earlier this season that he was using his opportunity training with the first team to learn from the three experienced forwards, who have scored more than 450 professional goals between them.

Wilson says England captain Rooney practices his free kicks every day, and often hits the target . Wilson has scored one Premier League goal this season, against Queens Park Rangers . And it is Rooney's ability to strike a dead ball that Wilson most appreciates about his captain. 'I would take Wayne's free-kicks because he practices them every day and more often than not they go on target at least, if not in the top corner,' Wilson said. Of Van Persie, who Wilson played alongside for the Under 21s on Monday night, the youngster praised his ability to create space to receive the ball.

        "article": "You might think that you\u2019re saving yourself some smart dollars by opting for the cheaper alternatives of everyday household items sold at two dollar stores but an environmental specialist has warned that you could actually be making your family sick. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children\u2019s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers \u00a0in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children\u2019s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it\u2019s not edible, it won\u2019t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4.\u00a0Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates\u00a0(stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.'

Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have\u00a0high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a \"priority chemical\", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin\u00a0(stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma. 'Consumers assume someone is regulating chemicals and that's where the problem lies.

Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been killed, dismembered and stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She achieved notoriety in January when a picture of her grasping a modified M4 assault rifle with an innocent smile on her face began circulating on social media. Scroll down for video . Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been found stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She gained notoriety in January when this picture began circulating online . The woman, who looks like she is in her late teens or early 20s, began operating under the name Rio Bravo. Cutting a slim physique and an almost innocent smile, she also donned a Kevlar jacket beneath a gold necklace. In the comments next to the striking image, people urged her to sell the gun and buy another TV while others prayed for her. A picture of her body laying next to a dead man and another woman was taken before another image was posted showing her dismembered body in the cooler. A tattoo saying 'Nino', the same as the one seen on her right forearm, is also seen in the cooler. Alongside the photo was a message warning people to 'keep sending theses f****** a*** holes', insisting they will meet the same fate. Her two predecessors also ran into bad luck during confrontations with law enforcement. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. According to The Daily Beast she started out as a police officer and became a hero when she was wounded during a shootout. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. She was arrested driving a stolen car with a revolver and six cellphones inside and was accused of being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals in 2011 . On Saturday violence erupted on the U.S border after security forces arrested one of the area's most influential drug dealers . She is then alleged to have signed with the Los Zetas cartel and was arrested in 2011 while driving a stolen car - with a revolver and six cellphones inside. She was subsequently arrested and charged with being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals. Months later Nancy Manriquez Quintanar was said to have taken part in a string of slayings, mainly from competing cartels. More than 100,000 people have died in gang-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.

        "article": "A five-year-old boy born with parts of his brain in the wrong place has stunned doctors by walking two miles every day. Brave Finley Lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia - which means many of his 'grey matter' cells have not migrated to the correct position. It left the boy, from Wallasey, Merseyside, unable to walk and talk, and with a 90 per cent chance of developing Epilepsy. Finley Lamb, five, pictured with his dad Dan and mother Sara, suffers from a rare brain abnormality . He is also highly likely to suffer heart, lung and bowel problems. But the five-year-old amazed mother Sara when he took his first steps last year and has continued to defy the odds by starting primary school - and he even makes the journey on foot. 'It was around May last year when Finley just got up on his own and walked across the room - we were amazed,' said the mother-of-two, 37. 'It just seemed to click with him and ever since then he has been building up from 50 metres a day, now to two or three miles five days a week. 'His programme says he has to do at least two miles a day and he can even get up curbs now on his own and walk up steps with a rail which is amazing. 'When Finley was diagnosed with PVNH we were told he would probably never walk or talk - but now he is in mainstream school and playing with the other kids and his little brother. 'We just can't believe his progress. We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to. We are so pleased.' Finley defied the odds to take his first steps last year and now enjoys walking the two miles to school . Finley made huge progress after he started a programme designed specifically for him by the Family Hope Center, based in Philadelphia, USA, just two years ago in April 2013. The centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate Finley's brain. Finley was diagnosed with PVNH when he was two years old, which affects around just 50 children in the UK. But the determined schoolboy has made huge developments - with his brain function going from 54 per cent to 76 per cent and his mobility increasing from that of a seven-week-old baby to a two-year-old toddler. And he now attends St Peter and St Paul Primary on the Wirral, Merseyside. Sara - who also has a three-year-old son Noah with husband Dan - said: 'Finley has made so much progress and that is why I am so passionate about getting this message out. 'It is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the Family Hope Center and he still wasn't able to walk or talk. And he was under a lot of emotional stress. 'At three-and-a-half he wasn't walking or crawling, he slept in a cot like a baby and couldn't speak at all. 'Now he doesn't stop talking. I nearly crashed the car one day because he said his first sentence and said 'Mummy I don't want to go there'. I thought there must have been someone else in the car. Finley's mother Sarah, pictured with him left, said: 'We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to' 'I think sometimes there is a misconception that disabled children don't realise what they are missing, but it was shocking for us to find out just how much Finley actually does understand. It is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey\u00a0that did not move to the correct location in the brain during early development. PVNH can cause seizures, breathing problems, joint problems, intellectual delays and other concern. It affects just 50 children in the UK. Little is known about the long term outcome of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia . 'He is very determined to do things now and he questions things when he cant do them. 'His behaviour has changed so much and I didn't think that was possible. 'He is so much more confident and independent, and just like a normal child now. It is amazing - he won't let me do anything for him now. 'It has been hard work for us, but if it is working you don't care how much effort or time it takes. I think he will have another year or two left on the programme then he should be finished.' Finley is due to have his fifth appointment with the Family Hope Center in Liverpool next week - and has visited the center in Philadelphia three times.",

When she set the World Record of 2:15.25 in the London Marathon in April 2003 \u2013 a time no woman has threatened 12 years later \u2013 there was no grinning until after she crossed the line. Similarly in 2005 when she recorded her third and final victory over the 26.2mile course from Blackheath to The Mall, emotions were kept in check until the end. The crowd lining the London Marathon course cheers for Paula Radcliffe as she wraps up a stellar career . Radcliffe breaks down at the end of the London Marathon on Sunday, her final competitive race . The world record holder for 12 years, Radcliffe said the time was irrelevant in her final London Marathon . Radcliffe runs down The Mall hand-in-hand with a fellow runner as she  takes in the atmosphere . But a time of 2:36.55 in her final competitive marathon is not to be sniffed at for a 41-year-old with a left foot as flexible as a rod of iron who described herself as \u2018unfit and unprepared\u2019 for the race. It is well inside 2:42.00, the IAAF qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics next summer. The British Athletics standards \u2013 which are likely to be sterner - have yet to be announced but it is immaterial as Radcliffe maintained this was it for her elite running career. \u2018My body can\u2019t train at this level any more,\u2019 she said, \u2018In Kenya [where she did a winter training camp] I pushed myself too hard and I broke down. I\u2019m sure the magic of London helped me run faster than I would or should have been capable of.\u2019 Radcliffe was due to give a BBC interview on Tower Bridge with Denise Lewis but the former heptathlete could not keep up. \u2018She ran alongside me for a little bit but it was too loud and I didn\u2019t want to stop because I was worried my foot wouldn\u2019t be able to start again.\u2019 Instead of running with the elite women, Radcliffe chose to take off with the 37,000-strong mass field . Radcliffe smiles at the front of the mass group as the elite men prepare to set off on their run . The 41-year-old sets off with the main field after having barely run since February due to injury . Radcliffe was in nowhere near the condition she was in when she set the 26.2mile world record in 2003 . Radcliffe began strongly, running at 2:30.00 pace for the opening 10kilometres. \u2018I ran the first mile in 5min30sec which was way too quick but every time someone shouted in the crowd it boosted me up again,\u2019 said Radcliffe, . \u2018I felt the achilles twinge at 7 miles then backed off. As much as my body wanted it to finish I didn\u2019t want it to end.\u2019 In the women\u2019s elite race, the attention pre-race was centred on four Kenyan women but Tigist Tufa broke away from the pack to become only the third Ethiopian to win the London marathon, after Derata Tulu in 2001 and Aselefech Mergia in 2010. Tufa, who the bookmakers judged a 25/1 shot before the race, crossed the line in 2:23.22 with two-time winner Mary Keitany 18 seconds behind. Ethiopia\u2019s Tirfi Tsegaye was third in 2:23.41. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge, a World Champion over 5,000m, triumphed in the men\u2019s race in 2:04.42, five seconds ahead of his compatriot Wilson Kipsang.

But any reign for the New York Wheel would be brief, as Dubai started construction a few days ago on a Ferris wheel that will be just 60ft higher. The humongous attraction on Staten Island promises stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, in addition to other New York City boroughs and the neighbouring state of New Jersey. Planners for the New York Wheel said it will offer stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and other New York boroughs . Set near the St George Ferry terminal the giant observation wheel will cost an estimated $25 to $30 for a 38-minute ride . Located next to the Hudson River the 630ft New York Wheel will be able to carry as many as 1,400 passengers at a time, with one full cycle taking about 38 minutes to complete. It will include mobile bar cars, a 20-seat restaurant, a 4-D ride on the ground and an LED light show every night, in addition to alternative energy sources. A shopping mall and 200-room hotel are to be built next door. Ticket prices will range from an estimated $25 to $30 (\u00a317 to \u00a320) as New York Wheel LLC, the company behind the ambitious project, hopes it will join the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building and Times Square as one of New York\u2019s must-visit attractions. Located on the bank of the Hudson River the New York Wheel will be able to carry as many as 1,400 passengers at a time . The $500million (\u00a3340million) observation wheel was designed by Perkins Eastman and EEK Architects, and is being built by Starneth BV, the Dutch company which erected the London Eye and is overseeing the Dubai Eye. Wil Armstrong, president of Starneth LLC, told Mashable that the Dubai Eye is ahead, but \u2018anything could happen to delay it\u2019 and give New York Wheel the lead. Dubai\u2019s observation wheel will stand 690ft tall when it is complete, making it the world\u2019s biggest. At 550ft, the current record holder is the High Roller in Las Vegas, followed by the Singapore Flyer (541ft), China\u2019s Star of Nanchang (525ft), and the London Eye (443ft). The $500million observation wheel  is being built by Starneth BV, the Dutch company which erected the London Eye . Planners hope the New York Wheel will join the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building as a top attraction in New York City . The original Ferris wheel, built in Chicago, was 264ft tall. New York\u2019s giant Ferris wheel will be located near the St George Ferry Terminal, which welcomes an estimated two million tourists every year. Planners for the New York Wheel believe it will attract more than three million riders every year, and claim it will create about 350 construction and 600 permanent jobs in ticket sales, maintenance and other positions. The company said it is currently in talks with the New York Police Department and a private security firm to prepare a security plan for the tourist attraction.",

        "article": "One New York-based teacher has found an incredibly fashionable and glamorous way to supplement his public school income, working as a model for some of the world\u2019s top designers. Sam Pearce, 24, of Milton, Massachusetts, initially came to New York City to peruse a career in education, and soon after arriving in the Big Apple he landed a job teaching English to eighth graders in Brooklyn, New York. But just a few months after landing the job, the six-foot, green-eyed Brown University graduate was 'discovered' on the subway by another model, who promptly asked whether he could send Mr. Pearce\u2019s picture to his own modeling agency in the hopes of getting him signed up. Model behavior: New York teacher Sam Pearce, 24, was discovered on the F train in New York City and now juggles his career as an eighth-grade English teacher with a side job modelling for top designers . 'I was taken aback and flattered, but also kind of incredulous,'\u00a0he told\u00a0Racked\u00a0of the encounter, which took place on the F train. 'He was just like, \"Hey, you're a model, right?\" I said, \"Noooo, I'm a teacher, dude.\"' Soon after,\u00a0Mr. Pearce, who was at the time teaching a summer school course and standing to earn $45,530 in the coming school year, signed a modelling contract with RED NYC and started posing for designer lookbooks and walking in fashion shows in London and Milan under the name Sam Worthen, a pseudonym taken from his mother's maiden name. But the hunky instructor insists that he doesn't let his side job posing for Alexander McQueen, Diesel Black Gold, and DKNY interfere with his responsibility to his students. Classroom to catwalk: Mr. Pearce says his two jobs are similar in that they are both hectic and he needs to keep a straight face during each of them . Renaissance man: Besides teaching and modelling, Mr. Pearce also speaks French, Spanish, and Italian and composes his own music . 'My agents have been pretty great about understanding that teaching is my priority, and they've gotten me jobs that require me to miss little or no school,' he said. 'I did the Alexander McQueen show \u2014 that was my first real show \u2014 over a weekend. I flew out to London on Saturday evening, did the show, and then flew home immediately after; so I was in London for 12 hours.' He also managed to fit walking in New York Fashion Week this February into his teaching schedule, modelling in shows during New York City public schools' week-long winter break. In fact, Mr. Pearce managed to maintain the secret of his second identity until very recently, and even then, he admits he only revealed himself because he thought the publicity could benefit his kids. Male model: Mr. Pearce knows there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking; he also places a lot of importance on getting his English students to read . 'I thought if people take interest in my story I could convert that interest into resources for my students,' he told Fox CT. Mr. Pearce launched a\u00a0Go-Fund-Me campaign\u00a0called The Right Book\u00a0to raise funds to buy all 67 of his students new books, and the attention his plea received helped him quickly surpass his goal of $3,000 in donations. He is now urging would-be donors to help more teachers and students through fundraising website DonorsChoose.org. 'I definitely think of myself as a teacher who happens to model, rather than a model who happens to teach,' he told\u00a0People, adding that it is clear to him that models are replaceable but teachers are not.",

        "article": "Genetically engineering plants and crops to change their DNA has been a cause of much controversy in recent years. But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years . The remarkable finding of \u2018foreign DNA\u2019 in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as \u2018nature\u2019s genetic engineer.\u2019 It is known to do something called \u2018horizontal gene transfer\u2019, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called \u2018horizontal gene transfer\u2019, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. This so-called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans (stock image shown) Sweet potato (shown) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands.\u00a0It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old . \u2018The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,\u2019 said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. \u2018It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.\u2019 The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process. The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans. However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands. \u2018In comparison to \"natural\" GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,\u2019 said Dr Gheysen.",

City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.",

Celebrity residents and good commuter links to the City have made Esher in Surrey the country\u2019s number one income tax hotspot, research shows . The average annual income is \u00a359,600 - more than \u00a330,000 above the average  gross annual salary. Like Esher, the other top five highest income tax-paying constituencies \u2013 Chesham and Amersham; Windsor; Beaconsfield; and Dorking and Leatherhead \u2013 are in the Home Counties and within an hour\u2019s commute of London. Only one of the top ten constituencies, Tatton in Cheshire, is outside the South-East. Covering Alderley Edge, Wilmslow and Knutsford, the area is another celebrity favourite, attracting residents such as Sir Alex Ferguson, Rio Ferdinand and Andy Cole. At the other end of the list, Stoke-on-Trent Central had the lowest bills, at \u00a32,100 - eight times lower than those in Esher.

The other top five highest income tax-paying constituencies include Windsor (castle above) and Beaconsfield . Mark Giddens, of UHY Hacker Young, said:\u00a0'The combination of a relatively high density of high earning celebrities and easy transport links to the City of London for those working in financial services, mean that many parliamentary constituencies across the South-East, and Esher in particular, are a real hotspot for the taxman. 'With the tax rate at 45% for the highest earners, pockets are clearly being created - mainly, but not solely, around the capital - where income tax bills are far outstripping the national average. \u2018Whether residents of Esher will relish the title of most highly income-taxed area of Britain is doubtful.\u2019",

        "article": "They will come up against each other in the year's first major on Thursday, but it wasn't that long ago that Rory McIlroy was looking up to Tiger Woods. The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him. Scroll down for video . A young Rory McIlroy is portrayed by an actor in the film as it charts his progress in the sport . McIlroy played golf from a young age and always admired Woods as he grew up in Northern Ireland . McIlroy grew up watching Woods and is now on his way to emulating his hero . McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form . Woods with McIlroy at the tee of the 12th hole final round of the Memorial Tournament in 2013 . 'I've been in that same situation,' said Woods. 'Growing up, Jack (Nicklaus) was my idol. My first recollection of the Masters was 1986, when Jack won. 'I remember him making a putt at 17 and lifting that putter up. Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him \u2013 someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol. 'It's been an incredible journey for me, going from massive fan to competitor,' he added. 'To think that not too long ago I was that little boy watching him on TV to where I am now. 'It's been a cool journey and I'm very lucky I get to compete with and against him, because he inspired me as a kid and he inspires me now. He's the best player I've ever seen.'",

        "article": "A baby girl has been badly disfigured in a dog attack at home after her parents left her by herself while they worked in nearby fields. Ten-week-old Qingqing is currently in a critical condition in hospital in eastern China, following emergency surgery to repair her mauled face. Her mother told the People's Daily Online: \u2018We left after our baby girl fell asleep. Who knew this would happen?' Recovering from surgery: Little Qingqing, who is just ten weeks old, has bandages around her damaged face . The woman, named only as Ms Li, said that on the day of the attack, she and her husband fed their daughter then went to work near their house in Haimen City, eastern China. But Ms Li could not stop thinking about her daughter so returned home after just ten minutes. When she arrived, a white dog with blood around its mouth came running towards her, she said. She dashed to the bedroom where she had left Qingqing - and discovered that the little girl had been dragged from her bed by the dog, which is believed to be a stray. Ms Li said: \u2018I nearly fainted. My baby girl was lying face flat on the floor, with blood all over.' Distraught: Qingqing's mother, identified only as Ms Li, at her daughter's bedside in hospital . The right side of Qingqing's face had been shredded and her eyelid torn off. She was carried to a local clinic by her mother but her injuries were too severe to be treated there. She was then transferred to the larger Nantong City No.3 People\u2019s Hospital, where she was operated on. She is recovering from the surgery but is suffering from a fever that is concerning her doctors. Her plastic surgeon, Dr Sun Jiyie, said: \u2018This is the youngest child with the most severe injuries we have seen from a dog bite. \u2018If she could safely power through the critical period, we will be planning more plastic surgery. But she is so young and the injuries are so severe, the operations will no doubt be very difficult.\u2019 Mrs Li, who is keeping a vigil at her daughter's bedside, said she and her husband only recently moved to Haimen after working at a greenhouse farm in another province for three years. Disfigured: A pixellated photo of Qingqing's face before her surgical dressings were applied (right) Last night Dr Zhao Xianzhong, the director of the hospital's burns and plastic surgery department, reminded all parents never to leave their babies and children alone. He also issued a general warning about dogs - saying attacks in China are more common in spring and summer. The hospital currently treats around 20 people a day for dog bites but the figure is expected to increase in the coming weeks as temperatures rise. \u2018When summer arrives, people wear less fabric, and dogs are only interested in exposed skin,' explained Dr Zhao. 'Girls should be more aware when they are wearing short skirts and shorts.\u2019",

        "article": "Floyd Mayweather has taken a very public swipe at his 'haters' ahead of his fight-of-the-century bout with Manny Pacquiao next month. The 38-year-old boxer has shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and carpets of cash on his Instagram account. The 15-second video shot by director James 'JP' Dayap, a proud member of The Money Team brand owned by Mayweather, hits out at his supposed haters. Scroll down for videos . Cash: Floyd Mayweather (pictured) has shared a video to his 5 million Instagram followers where he hits back at his supposed 'haters' Party: The 15-second video showing off his extravagant lifestyle even features a room full of half-naked girls twerking (pictured) for his amusement . Fighting talk: The word 'haters' appears at the start of the video, leaving no doubt about who it is directed at . Wealth: Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over footage of the five-division champion inspecting his fleet of super cars (pictured) Petrol head: Mayweather then walks past another row of expensive cars which seem to include Porsches and Ferraris . Bling: The footage which was shot and edited by director\u00a0James 'JP' Dayap - a proud member of Mayweather's The Money Team brand - features rows of jewel-encrusted watches . Super-fight: The 38-year-old boxer (pictured) is expected to earn around \u00a3120million for his upcoming bout against Manny Pacquiao . Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over the footage of Mayweather's opulent life and essentially lists his many expensive possessions which include: 'Big crib, ten cars, twenty acres.' As the lyrics boast 'I could write a book about money', the five-division world champion sits at his coffee table counting his endless piles of cash. The video then cuts to rows of luxurious Rolex watches adorned with jewels and Mayweather standing proudly in front of his Las Vegas mansion. A few seconds of the video even show four half-naked women twerking, supposedly for the boxer's pleasure. It surfaces just two weeks before one of the most anticipated fights in recent boxing history, when he takes on eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao. With the two fighters' management teams and the hosts MGM Grand locked in a stand-off between ticket allocations, they have yet to go on public sale. Money: The floors of Floyd Mayweather's house seems to be lined with hundreds of bank notes (pictured) The Instagram video also shows the many luxurious properties owned by Mayweather, including his Las Vegas mansion (pictured) Jewels: The video showing off Mayweather's unbelievable wealth and expensive possessions surfaces just two weeks before one of the most anticipated fights in recent boxing history . Business: Mayweather's The Money Team clothing brand (logo pictured) has been worn by stars like Justin Bieber and billionaire Warren Buffet . 'Normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' according to Connor Gregoire, an analyst for SeatGeek. He added: 'It is bizarre... To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Tickets for the fight were expected to cost between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena in the Las Vegas Casino. But those prices have incredibly tripled in the resale market before they have even gone on public sale. Mayweather's promoter said that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight but MGM Grand's officials have been tight-lipped about their availability. Scenic: Near the end of the video, the legendary boxer surveys a beautiful scene from a balcony . Rich: Mayweather shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and luxurious properties with his Instagram followers . The hotel issued a statement on Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalise a date for their release. Meanwhile Pacquiao's manager blamed the opposing fighter's camp for holding up the ticket sales, claiming they refused to sign an agreement drawn up months ago. Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up? 'Millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute because after the MGM takes its share, each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices.",

        "article": "Mister Money is now putting his money where his mouth is. Floyd Mayweather has commissioned a mouthguard not only imbedded with his usual diamond and gold bling but stuffed with $100 bills. Total cost, according to his favourite website TMZ, is\u00a0$25,000. Floyd Mayweather (left) vs Manny Pacquiao in the official advert for their mega-fight on May 2 . Pay-per-view watchers in America will have to pay up to $100 (\u00a367.48) to watch the fight . Manny Pacquiao posted a picture of him doing yoga on Monday as part of his preparation for the\u00a0big fight . Floyd Mayweather works in his gym as the fight with\u00a0Pacquiao draws closer . As the value of the richest fight of all time keeps rising ever closer to the half-billion mark, so does the value of Manny Pacquiao\u2019s target. If the PacMan does land the knockout blow, then given the expensive protection at least the Money Man should wake up smiling. Mayweather has just spent $300,000 on yet another vehicle, according to his favourite website TMZ. This is a Mercedes \u2018Land Yacht\u2019 people carrier to which he has added such extras as a 55-inch television and a champagne bar, to turn it into what he calls his \u2018Party Bus.\u2019 And so it turns out that all the time Andre Ward was talking about coming to England for a rematch with Carl Froch he was setting up yet another easy night out in his own backyard. Only a couple of days after the self-called Son of God declared he would be prepared to cross the Atlantic to face the Cobra, Ward revealed that his overdue ring comeback will be taking place in his California hometown on June 20. The opponent? Most likely a certain Marco Antonio Periban, who turned up in questionable condition to face James DeGale and was promptly knocked out in that final eliminator for Andre Dirrell\u2019s IBF super-middleweight title. Andre Ward is set to make his overdue ring comeback in his hometown on June 20 . So much for wanting to do it a second time with Froch to unify the WBA\u2019s two world championship belts. That fight had been ordered by the WBA and Froch\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn did his best to come to terms before the March 31 deadline . Now Ward\u2019s announcement has made it yet more likely that Froch might retire. Ward had claimed a readiness to overcome his phobia \u2013 either fear of flying or of fighting abroad. He wouldn\u2019t go as far as Froch\u2019s home city of Nottingham but he did express a willingness to travel to London for a showdown at either Wembley or the 02. His argument was that his US victory over Froch in the final of the Super Six super-middleweight tournament took place in Atlantic City, not Oakland. So London would be fairer than Nottingham. Still, Froch doubted he was serious and was apparently right to do so. It is back to home sweet home for Ward, at the Oracle Arena across the bay from San Francisco. If not exactly the offspring of the Almighty, Ward is a favourite son of American boxing. So the WBA appear compliant, with no sign yet of him being stripped of his belt. Foch is unlikely to get his dream fight against Ward or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Ward remains atop the ratings as their \u2018super\u2019 champion, with Froch still the \u2018regular\u2019 world titlist. Maybe the WBA are giving him license to shake off the ring rust after being out of the ring since his points win over another undistinguished foe, Edwin Rodriguez, way back in November 2013. Yet Ward\u2019s inactivity has long since become more a result of self-inflicted promotional disputes than his original injury. Now he is the first major signing by the new kids on that block, the music industry-backed Roc Nation, who are trying to confirm not only the opponent for June 20 but a TV deal. That the television rights have not been snapped up instantly by either of the major networks HBO or Showtime speaks to Ward\u2019s sluggish box office appeal despite the high professional regard for his skills. The closest he has come to properly fighting abroad has been a couple of low-key outings to the Caribbean. That he so much as contemplated travelling several thousand miles to face Froch indicates a realisation that he could make a lot more money in England. Still, that temptation is not enough. Not yet, anyway. He carries on talking about the Cobra later. But as it stands one of Froch\u2019s dreams for his farewell appearance \u2013 boxing at the City Ground home of Nottingham Forest \u2013 has been dashed. The other ambition \u2013 a fight in Las Vegas \u2013 hangs on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr coming through an interim bout and agreeing to meet him there in September. But Froch says: \u2018Unless I get a fight that excites me soon I may well hang up the gloves.\u2019 Ward, meanwhile, talks about meeting the challenge of middleweight KO sensation Gennady Golovkin \u2018soon'. Floyd Mayweather says: \u2018For me, Andre beats him every day of the week.' The questions, Andre, are which day? And where? The IBF still insist that Amir Khan, who has yet to confirm Chris Algieri or anyone else as his May 30 opponent, turned down a fight with Tim Bradley as a final eliminator for Kell Brook\u2019s world welterweight title. One question for the IBF: . Why would Khan bother with an eliminator when Brook is gagging to meet him in a Battle of Britain? Amir Khan's proposed fight with\u00a0Chris Algieri is yet to be confirmed .",

        "article": "The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a \u2018racer\u2019 and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been \u2018selfish\u2019 by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks \u2018positive\u2019 and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try,\u2019 he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try. \u2018They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the difference between us. I want to win always.\u201d \u2018And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u2018This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don\u2019t take away the fun of the racing. It\u2019s racing. I wouldn\u2019t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what Nico\u2019s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.\u2019 Hamilton\u2019s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion\u2019s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018Ultimately this is Formula One,\u2019 added Hamilton. \u2018I want the guy to be up my a*** if he\u2019s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.\u2019 The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year\u2019s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans\u2019 questions. One asked if he was \u2018crying\u2019 \u2013 by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: \u2018You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind and I\u2019ll try to show respect when it\u2019s due going forward.\u2019 Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? \u2018It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,\u2019 said the German. \u2018But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn\u2019t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That\u2019s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.\u2019",

        "article": "Sebastian Vettel is determined to ensure the return of a long-standing ritual at Ferrari is not a one-off this season. Fresh from Ferrari's first victory in 35 grands prix in Malaysia 11 days ago, and ending his own 20-race drought, Vettel returned to a hero's welcome at the team's factory at Maranello last week. The win allowed Ferrari to revive a tradition not seen at their base for almost two years since their previous triumph in May 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix courtesy of Fernando Alonso. Sebastian Vettel reflected on his stunning win for Ferrari at the Malaysian Grand Prix during the press conference before the weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . The four-time world champion shares a friendly discussion with McLaren star Jenson Button . Four-times world champion Vettel said: 'It was a great victory we had in Malaysia, great for us as a team, and for myself a very emotional day - my first win with Ferrari. 'When I returned to the factory on Wednesday, to see all the people there was quite special. There are a lot of people working there and as you can imagine they were very, very happy. 'The team hadn't won for quite a while, so they enjoyed the fact they had something to celebrate. There were a couple of rituals involved, so it was nice for them to get that feeling again.' Asked as to the specific nature of the rituals, Vettel replied: 'I was supposed to be there for simulator work anyway, but it was quite nice to receive the welcome after the win. Ferrari's Vettel and Britta Roeske  arrive at the Shanghai circuit . Along with a Ferrari mechanic, Vettel caught up with members of his old team Red Bull on Thursday . 'All the factory got together for a quick lunch. It was quite nice to have all the people together in one room - it was a big room! - so we were able to celebrate altogether for a bit. 'I also learned when you win with Ferrari, at the entry gate, they raise a Ferrari flag - and obviously it's been a long time since they last did that. 'Some 10 years ago there were a lot of flags, especially at the end of a season, so this flag will stay there for the rest of the year. 'We will, of course, try and put up another one sometime soon.' Inside the Ferrari garage, Vettel shares a discussion with team staff as he looks to build on his Sepang win . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene shares a conversation with Vettel at the team's hospitality suite . The feeling is that will not happen after this weekend's race in China as the conditions at the Shanghai International Circuit are expected to suit rivals Mercedes. Not that Vettel believes his success will be a one-off, adding: 'For here and the next races, we should be able to confirm we have a strong package and a strong car. 'We will want to make sure we stay ahead of the people we were ahead of in the first couple of races, but obviously knowing Mercedes are in a very, very strong position. 'In general, for the start of a season things can be up and down, and we want to make sure there is quite a lot of ups, not so many downs.

        "article": "Despite countless campaigns, protests and marches, the notion of blaming a victim for their rape remains shockingly high. The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'",

        "article": "Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Freshly laundered clothes still hang Friday in the dormitory at Garissa University College. Stuffed animals remain in one room. On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know . Investigators marked the locations of students' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217. Sometimes, the cell phones of the dead would ring, taking the workers aback. Beyond the bodies, evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere. Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. \"They were lying,\" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. \"Shoot them! Shoot them!\" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. \"Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,\" Titus said the gunman in charge said. \"We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,\" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. \"In the time of shooting, they skipped me,\" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo. Even longtime relief workers such as Reuben Nyaora with the International Rescue Committee said they were shocked at what they saw. \"I have seen many things,\" Nyaora told Agence France-Presse, \"but nothing like that.\" Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out .

        "article": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Andrew Lesnie, the Oscar-winning cinematographer who spent more than a decade collaborating with director Peter Jackson on the six \"Lord of the Rings\"and \"Hobbit\" films, has died. He was 59. The Sydney native, who also worked with New Zealander Jackson on the remake of \"King Kong\" (2005) and \"The Lovely Bones\" (2009), suffered a heart attack Monday. Said a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society: \"We have been advised of the sudden death of Andrew,\" adding that his family would provide an official statement later. Known for balancing technology with artistic considerations, Lesnie also shot \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (2011), directed by Rupert Wyatt. The cinematographer recently polished off The Water Diviner, the directorial debut of Russell Crowe, another New Zealand native. That movie opened Friday in U.S. theaters. Said Crowe on Twitter: \"Devastating news from home. The master of the light, genius Andrew Lesnie has passed on.\" Lesnie won his Oscar for his work on the first of the fabled \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001). His knack for getting the right feel of author J.R.R. Tolkien's most foreboding locales was remarkable. For the inaugural \"Lord of the Rings\" film, Jackson reached out to Lesnie after seeing his work on \"Babe\" (1995) and its 1998 sequel. Those Australian films, revolving around a pig and other animals, featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office. \"I'd never worked with him or even met him before, but he'd shot the Babe films and I thought they looked amazing, the way he'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect,\" Jackson said in a 2004 interview. \"And Babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that I wanted. \"So when we began looking for DPs in early 1999, I first decided to get either an Australian or New Zealand DP, as they'd be used to the way we make films,\" Jackson continued. \"Every country is slightly different in that way, and I immediately thought of Andrew. \" Lesnie's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film \"I Am Legend\" (2007), directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith; \"The Last Airbender\" (2010), from M. Night Shyamalan; and Healing (2014), helmed by Craig Monahan. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE (a provider of vocational education) and at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant. He honed his craft on low-budget short films and music videos and assisted on documentaries, features and commercials. He then spent several months on \"Wonder World,\" a children's afternoon magazine-style show. People we've lost in 2015 . \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

        "article": "Allegations: Veteran peer Lord Janner (pictured in 2002) has repeatedly denied claims he abused young boys at care homes and is now not fit to stand trial despite 'credible evidence' His name and face may not be immediately familiar to everyone today but, in his pomp, Lord Janner was one of the most prominent Labour politicians and campaigners of his time. His entry in Who\u2019s Who occupies nearly 50 lines: MP for Leicester West (1970-97)\u2026 distinguished barrister\u2026 author\u2026 broadcaster\u2026 former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. After training at the University of Cambridge and Harvard Law School, he qualified as a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a QC in 1971. He has fought tirelessly for the return of Jewish assets held in Swiss banks by the Nazis, and was made a life peer on his retirement from the Commons in recognition of his achievements in public life. Those are the bare facts of Greville Janner\u2019s gilded career. For nearly 25 years, however, a shadow has hung over Lord Janner of Braunstone in the same way it did Cyril Smith and a string of other establishment figures. We now know, from victims who have come forward following his death \u2013 too many for the allegations not to be true \u2013 that late Rochdale MP Smith was a serial paedophile. But was Janner? Detectives have interviewed more than 20 men who claim they were abused by Janner in their youth. It is suspected he used his hobby as a magician \u2013 Janner is a member of the Magic Circle \u2013 to get close to them and gain their trust when he visited children\u2019s homes in Leicestershire between 1969 and 1988. But the evidence will never be tested in court after Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that it was not in the public interest to put the Labour peer on trial because of his age and ill health. Janner, 86, is a father of three. His youngest daughter, Laura Janner-Klausner, 51, is an ordained rabbi and serves as senior rabbi at the Movement for Reform Judaism. His son Daniel Janner is a prominent QC. Janner\u2019s wife Myra died in 1996 and he has not been seen outside his flat in Hampstead, north-west London, since police investigating the claims of historic sexual abuse raided it in 2013. Shortly afterwards, reports emerged that he was suffering from advanced dementia. In the month before the raid, Janner attended the Lords 15 times, claiming \u00a32,100 in daily allowances, which has inevitably cast a critical spotlight on the decision to not prosecute him. Janner, it should be stressed, strongly denied the allegations against him \u2013 including claims of rape \u2013 when they surfaced nearly 25 years ago at the trial of Frank Beck, a care-home warden suspected of abusing scores of children in his care. Beck, a former Liberal councillor, was given five life sentences. Yet, the 1991 case made sensational headlines for very different reasons. One of those headlines can be found in a faded newspaper cutting. It reads: \u2018My Commons date and night with MP Janner.\u2019 The witness in question was Paul Winston, then aged 30, who lived at one of Beck\u2019s care homes in Janner\u2019s constituency. Mr Winston claimed under oath that Janner had abused him repeatedly between the ages of 13 and 15. Scroll down for video . Pointing: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, in what was is the most recent moving image of the Labour peer . Director of Public Prosecutions: Last year, Alison Saunders (pictured) said prosecutors will pursue justice for victims of child sex crimes whether their cases were '30 days or 30 years old' - but not in the Janner case . He said that he had sex with Janner in a Holiday Inn hotel, at the MP\u2019s home when his wife and children were away, and visited him in the Commons. The jury were shown letters the MP is said to have sent to him on House of Commons notepaper. Some were reportedly signed \u2018love Greville\u2019. They are now in the hands of the police. One was alleged to have been penned by Janner after they had stayed together at his home. \u2018It feels strange not to have you flipping around me like a friendly flea!,\u2019 the letter said. \u2018In fact \u2013 I miss you.\u2019 Referring to an encounter in the swimming pool of the Holiday Inn, Mr Winston said: \u2018I was fondled in my private area. It seemed at first like a bit of fun, being thrown around the water, but he would hold me close.\u2019 Beck used the testimony as part of his defence: that he was being prosecuted to divert attention from Janner and other high-profile (unnamed) paedophiles and that he was trying to shield the boys under his charge from them. Paul Winston was not the only witness to implicate Janner. Two others were called for the prosecution, saying Beck had raped them, but in cross-examination, they appeared to confirm some details of Mr Winston\u2019s story. Probes: Greville Janner, left in 1974, served as an MP for decades and was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2007.\u00a0Janner was mentioned during the trial of paediophile Frank Beck, right,  who died in jail . One, a woman, said she heard an argument between Beck and Mr Winston in which he [Beck] was shouting that he wasn\u2019t [allowed] to see Greville Janner any more.\u2019 The other, a man, said Mr Winston had boasted about \u2018having friends in high places\u2019. Were the allegations made simply to muddy the waters? The jury thought so, finding Beck, who died in prison in 1994, guilty of the majority of charges against him. Days later, Janner, then in his 60s, broke his silence on the affair by making a personal statement to Parliament. Under parliamentary rules, personal statements are not debatable, so there were no follow-up questions from MPs. Janner told them: \u2018There was, of course, not a shred of truth in any of the allegations of criminal conduct against me during the trial. \u2018Meanwhile, as my wife, my family and I have had a taste of the suffering which Beck can impose on innocent people, will you join me in sending the real sufferers, the individuals who endured his homes and whose lives have been wrecked at his hands, the profound sympathy of us all?\u2019 His statement was greeted with cheers. Fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz described Janner as a \u2018brave man\u2019 and others passed on leader Neil Kinnock\u2019s \u2018tremendous support\u2019. Police interviewed Janner and Mr Winston, but no charges were ever brought against the MP. One of the detectives who worked on the Frank Beck case was Mick Creedon, who is now Chief Constable of Derbyshire. Last year he made a sensational claim in The Times. He said there was \u2018credible evidence\u2019 against Janner and that he and his colleagues wanted to make an arrest but were prevented by \u2018more senior people\u2019 from doing so. To put it bluntly, the investigation was blocked. Influential: Lord Janner was chair of the Holocaust Educational Trust and vice-president of the World Jewish Congress . Mr Creedon said: \u2018The decision was a clear one: he [Janner] will be interviewed by appointment and there won\u2019t be a search of his home address or his constituency office, of his office in the House of Commons. It was a decision made by people more senior than me.\u2019 The allegations against Janner remained buried in newspaper archives until the authorities began re-opening historic child abuse cases in the wake of the Jimmy Savile affair. Many revolve around the Elm Guest House, a gay sauna in Barnes, west London, where boys are believed to have been abused by a string of powerful men in the 1970s and 1980s, including Cyril Smith. One of the people who contacted the police was Paul Winston. At the same time, two booklets from the archives of former MP Andrew Faulds \u2013 who died in 2000 \u2013 emerged. One, a four-page leaflet entitled Janner Fails to Answer \u2018Sex With Boy\u2019 Evidence and published by a group calling itself Concerned Leicester Parents, landed on the prominent Labour backbencher\u2019s desk in 1992. The second, a 24-page booklet entitled Is Grenville Janner QC, MP, Above the Law?, arrived in 1995. Both booklets appear to have been printed professionally and sent anonymously to Mr Faulds (and presumably to several other influential figures) by individuals anxious to ensure further attention was paid to the 1991 trial. While Janner\u2019s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case . The 1995 booklet provides a detailed account of an alleged victim\u2019s testimony. It tells how the boy spoke of meeting Janner in the Commons when he was 13. He said was invited to Janner\u2019s home when his wife was away. \u2018We ended up in his bed together and he cuddled me. We cuddled and fondled together. I didn\u2019t like it and told him to stop.\u2019 So began a two-year sexual relationship, the boy claimed. The booklet also says that the boy \u2018had been able to provide the police with information about Janner\u2019s home, hotel rooms, life, habits and person in... infinite and verifiable detail\u2019. The 1992 leaflet also refers to an alleged victim\u2019s \u2018detailed\u2019 evidence: \u2018Such evidence, submitted under oath... requires a specific and detailed refutation.\u2019 Crown prosecution lawyers have spent nine months studying volumes of evidence gathered by Leicestershire police against Janner. This week officers visited Mr Winston, now in his mid-50s and living on the outskirts of Leicester, and other alleged victims in person to inform them of the decision not to proceed with the case. It has raised further questions about the CPS in the face of growing criticism of the conduct of Operation Elveden against tabloid journalists. This is the fourth time that Janner has escaped prosecution. He was interviewed by police after the Beck trial, and was the subject of further allegations of abuse in 2002, but these were not referred to the CPS. A third investigation was launched in 2006 after police received a complaint from yet another alleged victim. A dossier was passed to the CPS which decided there was \u2018insufficient evidence\u2019 to bring charges. Inevitably, while Janner\u2019s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case.",

The company said the total number of containers in the recall comes to 'approximately 30,000.' Only five batches of hummus are being recalled - and only the company's Classic Hummus. 'This measure is limited to five SKUs of Classic Hummus sold nationwide,' Sabra Dipping Co. said in a release. 'To date, no other Sabra product is affected by this recall.' Scroll down to see the batches of hummus being recalled . Listeria concerns have led to thousands of Classic Hummus containers being part of a voluntary recall, Sabra Dipping Co. said Monday . The company said that 'The potential for contamination was discovered when a routine, random sample collected at a retail location on March 30th, 2015 by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.' The positive test happened at a Kroger in Port Huron, Michigan, a MDARD spokeswoman told the Detroit Free Press. The newspaper reported that Michigan officials contacted both the FDA and inspectors located in Virginia.\u00a0Sabra has a production plant in Virginia's Chesterfield County. Sabra Dipping Co. said that customers will be refunded if they return the products to stores. Both supermarkets and food service accounts had received products, the company said. The company said 'Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. 'Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.' The company said it has so far not yet received any sickness reports. On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about 260 people are killed each year by listeriosis, and about 1600 people get sick. Antibiotics are used on those who get listeriosis. Prevention methods include rigorously washing both produce and kitchen equipment; cleaning kitchen and food storage areas; rigorously cooking poultry and meats; storing food as soon as possible; and avoiding both unpasteurized milk and food products that include it as an ingredient, according to the agency.

A Borussia Dortmund fan holds up a sign thanking Klopp for his achievements in the last seven years . Arsene Wenger should be given more two more years at Arsenal, according to Nigel Winterburn . 'If Arsene Wenger decides to step down or move upstairs, then obviously he\u2019s a manager with the credentials, the way his teams play, I think a lot of people would think it\u2019s a perfect fit,' Winterburn told Goal. 'I would like Arsene Wenger to see out the next two years, and see where we are then, but obviously, with Klopp leaving Dortmund, it sort of puts the conundrum in because he\u2019s been linked with Arsenal before, particularly when Arsenal were struggling. Wenger was coming under severe pressure, so I understand where it\u2019s coming from but I would be surprised if there was a change this summer. 'This year we've just had, in terms of the spending power and the players coming in, and the next two, where we'll see the vision of where Arsenal are going to go and where they'll be after that.'",

        "article": "Trailing Birmingham City by two goals, Bournemouth were down to fourth in the Championship at one stage in the afternoon but a thrilling four-goal turnaround moved them back to the top. \u2018That\u2019s the madness of it,\u2019 manager Eddie Howe said in the aftermath. \u2018I couldn't believe in one game we dropped to fourth. It\u2019s great for the neutral, but not so great for us.\u2019 The south coast club had not conceded the first goal at Dean Court this campaign and have struggled to get anything from losing positions, but comebacks rarely come better than being two behind after 21 minutes. Charlie Daniels (right) fires home from the edge of the box to seal the win and make it 4-2 to Bournemouth . Yann Kermorgant slots home a penalty to cap a remarkable comeback and make it 3-2 to Bournemouth .

Attendance: 11,084 . Watford temporarily moved top by beating Middlesbrough, who started the day as leaders, in the lunch-time kick-off and Norwich then went above them with victory against Sheffield Wednesday. But Bournemouth have been this season\u2019s pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. \u2018We want eight,\u2019 the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. \u2018That didn\u2019t feel too good,\u2019 Howe admitted. \u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said nerves won\u2019 t come into it, it\u2019s only natural considering what\u2019s at stake.\u2019 But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level . Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down . Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1 . On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham\u2019s defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. \u2018I felt the officials were inconsistent,\u2019 Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.\u2019 If Birmingham\u2019s two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth\u2019s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar. The game was over in the 77th minute when Robinson was sent off for a foul last man. Referee Andy Woolmer handed out a straight red card, but it was hard to make out amongst the Birmingham red faces. David Cotterill celebrates making it 2-0 to Birmingham after just 21 minutes . Clayton Donaldson (centre) opens the scoring for Birmingham with a sublime lob over Artur Boruc .

        "article": "There'll be no need to queue up at the gates of Buckingham Palace and crane your neck to discover the sex of the new royal baby. In fact, all you'll need is access to the internet. When Prince George's brother or sister makes their entrance to the world, their arrival will be announced first on Twitter according to a report in\u00a0The Sunday Times. News of the royal delivery will then also be posted on the traditional easel behind the gates of Buckingham Palace, just like Prince George and Prince William before him - or her. Scroll down for video . When Prince George was born in July 2013 his birth was first announced in an emailed press release... ...before being displayed on the traditional easel inside the gates of Buckingham Palace . When Prince George was born in July 2013 his birth was first announced to journalists in an emailed press release. A formal notice signed by the doctors who delivered him was then taken by police escort to Buckingham Palace  and displayed at the gates to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion. A palace spokesman said at the time: 'We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence.' Clarence House also tweeted the news, and the British Monarchy's Facebook page was also updated. Royal sources say the only difference between the birth of Prince George and his brother or sister will be that there will be less ceremony around the delivery of the piece of paper from the Lindo Wing of St Mary's to Buckingham Palace. The signed document is expected to be taken out of a side door and delivered to the palace in an unmarked vehicle. And it's not the first time the Duke and Duchess have chosen Twitter to deliver news. When the couple got engaged in October 2010 the announcement was first made on Twitter the following month. The birth of Prince William was first announced on an easel outside Buckingham Palace in 1982 . Prince William's birth announcement was signed by the doctors who delivered him . With the Duchess due to give birth any day, one gambler has bet \u00a310,000 that she will give birth to a girl. The man, in his late 30s and from Manchester, will collect more than \u00a315,000 in winnings, which includes his original bet, if the royal baby is a princess. Bookmakers Ladbrokes said the anonymous punter normally gambles on horse racing and football, and this is his first bet on the Royal Family. The Duchess in March at one of her last public appearances before the birth of her new baby . The man said: 'I'm not really bothered by the royals, but I'd just had a big win and my missus reckons it's a girl, so that's a good enough reason for me.' Ladbrokes set the odds of the baby being a girl at 8/15 and 11/8 for a boy. William and Kate's fourth wedding anniversary on Wednesday April 29 is now one of the favourite arrival dates at 4/1. Alice remains the favourite girls' name at 5/4, while Charlotte is 5/1. Arthur is the favourite boys' name at 12/1 and James has odds of 20/1. As the wait for the royal baby continues, Prince Harry has a rapidly reducing window of opportunity to meet his new niece or nephew before he returns overseas. He flew back to the UK to attend the London Marathon after commemorating the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey. He chatted to St John Ambulance volunteers and handed out medals to winners of the elite races. Harry is scheduled to return to Australia tomorrow. David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Murnaghan on Sky News today: 'I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. 'All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.' He added: 'The NHS is superb and I've seen that in my own life in so many different ways but I believe in choice, I believe in people being able to do what they want to do, and as I say I've only got one thought about the royal baby which is a happy and healthy arrival.' The baby will officially be overdue if Kate has not given birth by May 1, and even Kate herself has said the baby is due mid to late April. Parking restrictions outside the Lindo Wing run out after April 30. Some believe labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon, and the next full moon is on May 4. The suggestion is that the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects the water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth last time on July 22, it was the day of a new full moon.",

        "article": "They were the biggest of the Ice Age giants, roaming the frozen plains of the Northern Hemisphere. But it seems the final days of the woolly mammoth were a sad struggle for survival. Genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred. Scroll down for video . The last of the woolly mammoths (shown in the reconstruction above) were isolated on an Arctic island for around 5,000 years, forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled until disappering 4,500 years ago . Researchers have concluded that the creatures clung on in just a tiny pocket of the Arctic, on an island that appears to have become cut off from the mainland. The study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants. Scientists claim to have taken a major step towards recreating the woolly mammoth by inserting more than a dozen of the creature's genes into the live DNA of an elephant. Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal\u2019s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes . Other researchers have proposed using mammoth DNA to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone Dolly the Sheep. However, many scientists fear these animals would be unable to survive in the modern world without their ancient habitat. Such techniques also can lead to deformities and health problems in the animals. However the researchers behind the genetic analysis have urged other scientists not to attempt this for fear of the suffering it may cause to the animals. Instead, they say their findings have revealed new insights into the evolutionary history and demise of the woolly mammoths. They have published full DNA sequences of one mammoth found in Oimyakon, northeast Siberia \u2013 thought to be around 45,000 years old \u2013 and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on Wrangel Island, north of Russia in the Arctic Ocean. They found that the mammoths on Wrangel Island had been isolated for at least 5,000 years, eking out a meager existence there before dying out 4,500 years ago. Analysis showed that the parents of the mammoth found on Wrangel Island had been distant relatives, suggesting the population had been inbreeding. Dr Love Dal\u00e9n, an associate professor of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History who took part in the study, said: \u2018We found that the genome from one of the world\u2019s last mammoths displayed low genetic variation and a signature consistent with inbreeding. \u2018This is likely due to the small number of mammoths that managed to survive on Wrangel Island during the last 5,000 years of the species\u2019 existence.\u2019 The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Cell Biology, found that the mammoth genome only appeared to align with African elephant DNA by between 64 per cent and 76 per cent. Researchers extracted DNA from the remains of two woolly mammoths who died 36,000 years apart . Scientists have been able to extract DNA from mammoth hair (above) and tusks found across Siberia . Mammoths are thought to have evolved around 400,000 years ago in eastern Asia and is a close relative to the Asian elephant. The researchers analysis revealed that mammoths appear to have suffered significant setbacks around 250,000 to 300,000 years ago where their population was decimated. However, they then recovered before they experienced a further hit to their populations around 116,000 to 130,000 years ago. The population then appears to have remained stable until 12,000 years ago when their numbers were drastically reduced. The researchers believe the mammoths in Oimyakon and Wrangel separated around 50,000 years. Hunting by humans has long been thought to be what drove the mammoths to extinction while climate change has also been blamed. The researchers studied mammoth remains found at Oimyakon in Siberia and Wrangel Island (shown above) This mammoth tusk on Wrangel Island in Russia belonged to one of the last  mammoths before they died out . The new results suggest the animals were already in decline by the time humans began moving into Europe 45,000 years ago. Professor Hendrik Poinar, director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University who was also involved in the research, said the DNA raises the prospect that mammoths could now be brought back from extinction. Organisations like the Long Now Foundation have said they hope to resurrect the mammoth. Professor Poinar said: \u2018This discovery means that recreating extinct species is a much more real possibility, one we could in theory realize within decades. \u2018I think in the future it will be inevitable that we will be able to do it, but the bigger question is should we do it. \u2018With a complete genome and this kind of data, we can now begin to understand what made a mammoth a mammoth\u2014when compared to an elephant\u2014and some of the underlying causes of their extinction which is an exceptionally difficult and complex puzzle to solve.\u2019",

        "article": "Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week . According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle . At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Early career: \u00a0Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series . Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it\u2019s not fun to live in this guy\u2019s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, \"What\u2019s the difference between you and Don?\" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I\u2019m not immune to that, . 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it\u2019s gotten worse year after year. It\u2019s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it\u2019s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.",

Nine out of every ten images of child sexual abuse found online in 2014 showed children aged ten and under, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year . That was a dramatic increase from the year before, when around two-thirds of the child porn it found featured children of such a young age. They were part of a worrying rise in the amount of child abuse the IWF discovered online. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year. The jump came after the internet watchdog was told that it could proactively seek out abusive content online, in order to shut it down. The IWF won the extra powers last year in the wake of the 2012 murders of Tia Sharp, 12, and April Jones, five \u2013 girls who were both killed by men who watched child porn online. Emma Hardy, the IWF's director of external relations, said: 'The biggest change for us last year was our ability to proactively search for child sexual abuse imagery. Our analysts are able to actively search for the content, rather than merely wait for reports to come in from the public. 'That's made a huge difference. Last year we were able to process 74,000 reports and identify just over 31,000 child sexual abuse web pages. 'I think there's still a huge amount out there. We've got a long way to go until we see the peak of this problem.' In its annual report, the IWF said it alerts law enforcement agencies and hotlines in other countries when it discovers foreign-based web pages with child sexual abuse images and 'repeatedly chases' them until they are removed. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion  for running websites that capitalised on the internet as a forum for public shaming . Most of the photographs and videos of sexual abuse that the IWF found online were on websites hosted in North America. Just 0.3 per cent of the images \u2013 just over 90 pictures or videos \u2013 appeared on web pages hosted in Britain, down from 18 per cent in 1996, when IWF was founded. But although more child porn is now being removed from the web, the shocking figures also highlight the massive scale of the problem online. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of IWF, said technology companies were 'stepping up' efforts to tackle the amount of images of sexual abuse online. But she added that many of them were still too slow to take images down, or failed to acknowledge they have a problem. 'This year will ensure they have nowhere to hide as we will be targeting them for the benefit of all internet users and victims of sexual abuse,' she said. IWF is funded by 117 technology companies around the world, including Google, Facebook and Twitter. Criminals are using many legitimate websites to distribute pictures and videos of child sexual abuse imagery, the IWF said. In particular, they targeted websites which are specifically designed to allow users to upload pictures, and make them available via a unique web page address, or 'URL'. Nearly 20,000 of the web pages removed last year were hosted by these sorts of sites. \u00f7 Paedophiles are using the digital currency bitcoin to buy child sexual abuse images online, the IWF found. It said a number of the most prolific commercial child sexual abuse websites started accepting the currency last year.",

        "article": "Beijing (CNN)A day after the Chinese government released five young feminists on bail, their families and supporters expressed mixed emotions on the unexpected development. Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Zheng Churan, Li Tingting and Wu Rongrong were freed from the Haidian Detention Center on the outskirts of Beijing late Monday. The five activists on women's rights -- aged from 25 to 32 -- were picked up by police in three different cities just before March 8, the International Women's Day. They had been planning a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation. \"I'm still speechless and don't know how to react,\" tweeted Li's girlfriend Suan Xiaola to the couple's friends upon hearing the news. \"No tears, no ecstasy... just wondering what we're going to do next.\" \"I can't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal,\" echoed Li's lawyer Yan Xin on Chinese social media. \"Without closing their cases, they still can't live without shackles -- we'll have our work cut out for us.\" Police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of \"assembling a crowd to disturb public order,\" which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future, Wu's lawyer Liang Xiaojun told CNN. They will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted, and police can summon them for questioning at any time, Liang added. \"This shouldn't be a moment of celebration,\" he said. \"The arbitrary detention and release of these women really shows the backwardness of China's legal system.\" Under China's household registration system, only Li is considered a Beijing resident. Police sent the other four back to their hometowns, disrupting their work and lives, according to the women's lawyers. Many have called the five members of Women's Rights Action Group trailblazers. Staging their protests through performance art or flash mobs, they highlighted feminist causes ranging from fighting domestic violence, gender equality at work, to more female public bathrooms -- drawing nationwide attention and even state media praise. Their detention had drawn widespread condemnation, including from the United States. \"Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world,\" said John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, in a statement Friday. \"We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them.\" Kerry's predecessor Hillary Clinton -- a longtime champion of women's rights who just announced her bid for the U.S. presidency -- called the jailing of the feminists \"inexcusable\" on Twitter, joining the \"free the five\" hashtag campaign. China had rejected all international criticisms, insisting it's a country ruled by law and that its judicial sovereignty be respected. Supporters of the woman activists, however, sense the chilling effect of their ordeal on China's nascent civil society, as the ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping continues to tighten its grip over the country. \"Of course people will feel more afraid,\" said Wei's lawyer Wang Qiushi. \"Women's rights is among the most politically correct issues in China -- now even those who took up that cause ended up in jail.\"",

        "article": "(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.",

        "article": "It is billed as the most important meal of the day and many people grade a restaurant on the quality of their bacon and eggs on offer. But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.",

        "article": "(CNN)The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. \"There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers,\" wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon: . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected,\" Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means \"the union of the plants,\" cited that federal law in suing the federal government. \"The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca,\" the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. \"The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA,\" the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely \"retaliation against the kosher inmates\" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited \"the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida.\" Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a \"dangerous weapon\" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as \"a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings,\" they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. \"The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000,\" Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. \"Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing,\" he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid \"the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA,\" according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Sexy lingerie brand Frederick's of Hollywood has shut down all of its brick-and-mortar locations, now existing exclusively as an e-commerce brand after years of declining sales and struggling to keep up with Victoria's Secret. The Los Angeles-based company has switched to a web-only retail model following the closure of all of its 94 locations, with the brand now encouraging customers to shop online,The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday. 'We no longer have store locations,' reads the brand's website, which goes on to note that the online store offers the same selection of products. Scroll down for video . New look: Frederick's of Hollywood, which is known for its sexy lingerie (pictured), has closed all of its brick-and-mortar locations . Making it work: The retailer announced on it's website that it 'no longer' has store locations while reminding customers that its 'online store offers the same selection of products' 'As a company, I think they became old and stale,' Ron Friedman, a retail expert at consulting and accounting firm Marcum, told The Los Angeles Times.\u00a0'Victoria's Secret has been a home run compared to them.' But Mr Friedman went on to say that Frederick's of Hollywood Group Inc. can still be successful with\u00a0careful corporate strategy. 'They have to really focus and hire people that really understand the online business,' he noted. Founder Frederick Mellinger opened the\u00a0pinup-inspired lingerie brand's first store in Los Angeles in 1947 and went on to launch a mail order catalog in the 1960s, later adding sex toys and more risqu\u00e9 attire to the company's offerings. Mr Mellinger, who famously said 'sex appeal is always in style', died in 1990 at the age of 76. A decade later in 2000, his namesake company, which once had pin-up icon Bettie Page modeling its lingerie, declared bankruptcy. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2003, the company went public in 2006. Party's over: The Frederick's of Hollywood store pictured was one of the 94 locations that have been closed . Celebrity fans: Actress Sofia Vergara (R) recently revealed that she used to buy bras for her size 32F breasts at Frederick's of Hollywwood, while Blurred Lines dancer Emily Ratajkowski has modeled for the lingerie retailer . Star power: Emily, 23, can be seen posing in a black corset for the sexy lingerie retailer . Two years ago the struggling brand was purchased by a consortium that includes HGI Funding, a subsidiary of New York-based Harbinger Group Inc., and some of its own shareholders. While Frederick's of Hollywood has changed the way it does business, one A-list celebrity has recently been reminiscing about her relationship with the brand. Modern Family star Sofia Vergara, 42, told Vanity Fair that her size 32F breasts and tiny frame make it nearly impossible to find lingerie, so she used to frequently shop at the store when she first got her start. 'My boobs are, like, huge,' she said in the May issue of the magazine. 'My whole life, buying a bra was a nightmare. What I used to do when I moved to LA, I found places like Frederick's of Hollywood that make bras for streetwalkers ... I can't think of the word ... you know... dancers... strippers. Skinny girls with gigantic boobs.' Another fan, 23-year-old Blurred Lines dancer Emily Ratajkowski, who went on to score a plum role in the 2014 thriller Gone Girl, previously modeled for the lingerie retailer.",

'Reenactment MfS' - the Ministry for State Security better known as the 'Stasi' during the 40 year existence of the East German state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as evidence in the show trials against those they caught. They were also thought to have been used for training purposes for border guards and trainee agents intended to inculcate in them awareness of the lengths people would go to in order to try to escape the workers' paradise that was the German Democratic Republic. Scroll down for video . Foiled: The Stasi - East Germany's secret police - forced people to pose for their pictures, showing exactly how they had planned to escape from the German Democratic Republic . Humiliation: The families were forced to line up and pose for the pictures, which were used as 'evidence' Lessons: The photographs were also used to train up border guards, so they knew what people might try to do to escape the confines of East Germany . Hidden: These pictures were found in the archives of East Germany's Stasi secret police, presumably the clothing of someone who had tried to flee the Communist regime . But photographer Arwed Messmer, who discovered the pictures, sees another reason for the pictures of\u00a0families desperate to escape the grasp of East Germany. 'Of course when I saw these photos of families for the first time I was reminded of Abu Ghraib,' he said, referring to the prison in Iraq where American gaolers humiliated their prisoners for amusement and captured the images of their degradation on camera. Messmer found the remarkable photos in a box at the Stasi Archive in Berlin, where mile upon mile of yellowing paperwork - the files of the secret policemen which they managed to neither burn or shred in the East German state's dying hours - now reside. Together, they constitute a fascinating if grim epitaph to a nation which erected the Berlin Wall to hermetically seal in its citizens. One of the photos shows a man sitting in a homemade raft made out of polystyrene slabs, nylon rope, and wooden boards. He was transporting it to the Baltic Sea near the East German resort of Boltenhagen on July 9, 1981, when he was apprehended, tried and flung into prison. Simple: A picture of a ladder, which some desperate person had used to try to escape to the West . Creativity: The ingenuity of people trying to escape was remarkable: one picture shows a girl hiding in a gearbox compartment, while others simply show the vehicle in which they tried to make their escape . Evidence: Other pictures, like these blood stained tops, look more like a picture which might be taken by police for use in a court case today . Another is of a primitive float constructed out of a car tyre inner tube, a fan motor and car battery. The craft was assembled by a man who worked in a factory which made Trabant cars. He intended also to sail from Boltenhagen to get to the west on June 26, 1989. But he was apprehended before he hit the shoreline and also ended up in jail. Collection: All the pictures have now been brought together in a book by the photographer Arwed Messmer . One of the more poignant photos shows a young boy standing outside a car with its boot open, his sister forced to lie inside, just as she was found when their car was stopped at Checkpoint Bravo in Berlin as it headed west on September 12 1983. It is believed the children were sent to a Stasi orphanage, their mother arrested. Also caught in the cold glare of the Stasi photographic lens was an East German family and their West Berlin escape helpers, Oliver Mierendorf and Karlheinz Hetschold, who tried to smuggle them west in an Opel car on September 21, 1973. The ingenuity of the people smugglers knew no bounds. One of the photos shows a young girl lying in the gearbox compartment at the front of a Peugeot 403 on September 9, 1965, as two U.S. soldiers attempted to get her through the border to the west. Tunnels, people caught in vans, others caught in car boots as well as models of the Stasi HQ speak from the pages of the book: silent witnesses to an unforgicing system which killed hundreds and imprisoned thousands more before it imploded in 1989. Messmer said: 'Many of these pictures were surely made within the kind of standard crime investigation routine you can find all over the world. 'In these reenactments I suspect that the East German authorities wanted to at least keep up the semblance of the rule of law, by giving state prosecutors visual evidence, even if a later trial verdict was already pretty certain at the time of arrest. 'I would say that the humiliation caused by this form of documentation was more like collateral damage, and that it was accepted as simply part of the process.'",

        "article": "(CNN)I've visited Nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade, and of the more than 100 countries that Save the Children serves, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites. There are the usual things that are said about it -- the stunning landscape, which includes Mount Everest, and the amazing food. But Nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years. In fact, I remember a time just last May when I sat with a group of mothers and their tiny babies as they told me how proud they were that they now understood how important it was to make sure they prioritized breastfeeding and nutritious foods. They spoke of the wonderful future they were now expecting for their children, and they shared with me the big dreams that they had. So you can imagine the indescribable sadness I experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that Nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934, when more than 10,000 people were killed. While casualty accounts following the magnitude-7.8 quake Saturday are still difficult to confirm -- hardly surprising considering that communication lines have been severely disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands, with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours and days pass. The fact that the epicenter of this quake was so close to the capital of Kathmandu, where the majority of Nepal's citizens reside, makes the situation even more dire. Many of these people live in cramped conditions and have never lived outside the city. As a result, it is unlikely they even have a home village to go to temporarily for shelter. Housing the scores of newly homeless will be a tall order. It is still quite cold at night in Nepal, so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance. Compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days; Nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake. In fact, even getting food to people will be a logistical nightmare, given that the entire country -- which is about the size of Tennessee -- is served by only two main roads, which have likely been badly damaged, if not destroyed. We have been in situations like this before, and know what to do. But time is not on our side -- we have only a few short weeks before the rainy season begins, which will make an already difficult job close to impossible. With that in mind, we have set up a fund to help address the immediate needs of children, who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency. We and other relief organizations will be doing everything we can to help get Nepal back on its feet without having to wait for more people to die from diseases that will inevitably come from contaminated water and the like. Only the oldest Nepalese will remember the last major earthquake, so the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing concerning for us as we and other agencies launch our response. And while we can rebuild Nepal after this tragedy, it will take time and help. I hope that we can all play a role in making sure that the tremendous gains that have been made in this country that I love so dearly will not have been in vain.",

        "article": "An amateur cyclist is planning to ride the entire Tour de France - considered the most gruelling race in professional cycling - on a Raleigh Chopper. Dave Sim has put in months of training aboard his bright yellow Mark Three Chopper in preparation to ride all 2077 miles of the 2015 Tour de France route this summer. The 36-year-old personal trainer from Southport, Merseyside, is hoping his stunt will inspire people to get out and ride themselves. Scroll down for video . Dave Sim, 36, rides his Raleigh Chopper on the L'Etape du Tour last year. He now hopes to cycle the entire Tour de France . The tour involves many hill climbs which are grueling even for professionals using high-performance road bikes . Mr Sim and two others, who are using proper road bikes, attempt a hill climb in France last year . Mr Sim said his Chopper is as close to standard as possible, but required a better seat and tweaked brakes . Mr Sim said his Chopper - the 2004 revival of the iconic 1970's children's bike - is as close to standard as possible. He said: 'I've tried to make as few changes as possible so it's got the original tyres. 'The main thing I've changed is the seat post and the pedal arms as it was originally designed for kids. 'And the wheels - on the first part of the race through Northern France, there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles, so a guy made me some really strong wheels as I kept breaking spokes. 'I've also had to put slightly better brakes on as well. 'Up the biggest climbs it gets a bit grim, it was just two degrees at the top of one, the Col de Tourmalet - it took me forever to get down, I was almost hypothermic at the bottom.' While it's by far the longest ride he's attempted, Mr Sim has completed long rides on the Chopper before. Mr Sim attempted the L'Etape du Tour on the Raleigh Chopper last year and finished in the top 20 per cent . Mr Sim hopes his audacious attempt to ride the Tour de France will inspire others to take up cycling . Pictured left, Mr Sim stands with others riding the L'Etape du Tour. Right, he is pictured with his Chopper in the Lake District . He said: 'I did the L'Etape du Tour last year it's a mass start event where thousands do a stage of the Tour de France on closed roads. 'Lots of people didn't think I could do it, but I thought, why not have a go? 'I did really well, got a really good time, I was in the top 20 per cent, so the next morning, I thought about doing the full tour. 'I thought, if I could do one day, is it possible to do the whole tour? 'After the Etape I shouldn't have wanted to even see a Chopper again, but it was a bit of a Eureka moment, that's where it came from. 'I come from a cycling family, my mum and dad would take me to see the Tour, riding up mountains is in my blood. 'It's always been a bit of a dream to ride the Tour de France, I won't do it again, my dad said he never would have thought I'd do it on a chopper!' He said: 'Part of the motivation was to show people you don't need a \u00a310,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me \u00a3100, and I'm doing the Tour on it. With a bike, it's mostly to do with the engine. 'In the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you don't need all that, you just need to get out and ride. 'The other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for Help for Heroes as possible.' Mr Sim also hopes his stunt will raise as much money as possible for charity Help for Heroes .",

        "article": "If Andrew Strauss becomes England\u2019s new supremo, the comeback hopes of Kevin Pietersen, which gained momentum with the sacking of Paul Downton, would come to an abrupt halt. Strauss said on Saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages Pietersen sent to South African opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago. Pietersen begins his county comeback with Surrey against Oxford University in The Parks on Sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves and emboldened by the demise of Downton, the man who sacked him last year. Andrew Strauss (right) says the Kevin Pietersen affair is a 'distraction' for English cricket . Strauss and Pietersen pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with India . Yet his hopes of an England return would seem over if Strauss succeeds in becoming the new England director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on Friday. \u2018It\u2019s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation,\u2019 said Strauss, who infamously called Pietersen \u2018a complete c***\u2019 on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off. \u2018That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It\u2019s become that big. The ECB and the England team\u2019s efforts to move on from him haven\u2019t worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.\u2019 Strauss\u2019s views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed. \u2018If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it\u2019s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,\u2019 Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord\u2019s podcast. \u2018You\u2019re building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place . Pietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director . \u2018I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can\u2019t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.\u2019 Michael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties. Graves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton. That means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded. There were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. Pietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008 . Strauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measure . Now the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests. Vaughan is here to commentate on England\u2019s three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team. It will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment. Vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role. Jimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England\u2019s leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. England bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role . \u2018I don\u2019t really have an opinion because we\u2019re concentrating on building up to a Test,\u2019 said Anderson. \u2018That\u2019s for the two new guys in charge. They\u2019ve obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get the right man for the job.\u2019 Even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan. Clearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him. The distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played. It is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here.",

        "article": "West Ham are confident that the deal to move into the Olympic Stadium does not contravene domestic or European legislation and 'categorically' stated that it does not constitute state aid. The Premier League club are set to move into the London 2012 showpiece venue for the start of 2016-17 season, but the journey there has been a tortuous one, fraught with controversy. Fresh questions were raised about the award of the 99-year lease to West Ham on Tuesday, when it was suggested the deal may contravene European state aid law. David Sullivan, Boris Johnson,  Karren Brady, Sir Robin Wales and David Gold at the Olympic Stadium . West Ham trio Diafra Sakho, Winston Reid and Mark noble smile for the camera at the Olympic Stadium . The report suggests the failure of London Mayor Boris Johnson and the London Legacy Development Corporation to obtain prior approval from the European Commission before signing the deal opens up the possibility of challenges from anyone who feels disadvantaged. That could leave West Ham facing a large compensation bill, but the club defended their position in a lengthy statement about the Olympic Stadium deal. A West Ham spokesman said: 'West Ham United is confident that its agreement with the LLDC complies with all relevant UK and European legislation and categorically does not constitute state aid. 'Indeed, the European Commission looked into a complaint in relation to our move to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2013 but 'decided not to further pursue' the matter. 'The club was selected as anchor concessionaire following a fair, transparent and robust process that was open to any group or organisation in the country. 'Out of the four proposals submitted, West Ham's was selected as it delivered a sustainable and viable future for the Stadium and, crucially, provided the best return for the taxpayer.

'The agreement with the LLDC will see West Ham make a substantial capital contribution towards the conversion works of a Stadium that it may only rent for up to 25 matchdays a year, pay a multimillion pound annual usage fee, as well as offering a share of food and catering sales from its supporters. 'The worldwide draw of hosting the most popular and watched football league in the world in such an iconic venue will add value to any sponsorship and commercial agreements related to the Stadium, which the public purse stands to further benefit from. Premier League club are set to move into the London 2012 showpiece venue for the start of 2016-17 season . Fresh questions were raised about the award of the 99-year lease to West Ham on Tuesday . 'It is clear that the linking of the naming rights to West Ham United generates real cash value for the LLDC. 'Without West Ham United, the Stadium would continue to cost the taxpayer millions of pounds a year. 'With us, the public purse will see a return on the hundreds of millions of pounds that were committed to build the Stadium, long before West Ham's association had begun.'

The airstrikes Thursday targeted rebel Houthi militant positions in three parts of Sanaa, two Yemeni Defense Ministry officials said. The attacks lasted four hours. The strikes caused no casualties, but did destroy all three military compounds that were targeted, the officials said. They said Saudi airstrikes were also targeting Houthi positions in Lahj province. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly month-long air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, security sources in Taiz said. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. They said explosions lasted for about 40 minutes. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners started pounding Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the Yemeni government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' On Wednesday, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa, a senior Saudi source said on the condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels had captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who says he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Salim Essaid, Nic Robertson and Josh Levs contributed to this report.",

Chris Ramsey's side are still in the relegation zone but the defender believes other teams will be worried about them. Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal in Tuesday's 3-3 draw at Aston Villa, a result which denied QPR the chance to climb out of the bottom three. Clint Hill celebrates after scoring QPR's second goal in Tuesday night's thrilling 3-3 draw at Aston Villa . Hill's header levelled the scores at 2-2 on Tuesday. QPR would lead again before being pegged back . Rangers remain two points adrift of safety in the Premier League table . They are third bottom, two points from safety, after Christian Benteke's hat-trick rescued Villa but, following Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom and a point on Tuesday, Hill is confident about their survival chances. 'We have dragged teams in to it now, Villa probably thought they could win the game and pretty much put themselves safe,' he said, ahead of Sunday's visit of Chelsea. 'But we've brought another team into it and the pressure goes onto the next game. It's about the team and players who hold their head and keep calm who will prevail and stay in this league. 'The positive is we have four points from difficult travels and we're right in the battle now so we're looking forward to the next game.' Matt Phillips opened the scoring, although Benteke struck twice in the first half to give Villa the lead.

Hill made it 2-2 before Charlie Austin put Rangers 3-2 up with 12 minutes left but Benteke completed his treble with a 25-yard free kick five minutes later. 'I'm glad I've got the goal because it's been bugging me for a number of years, I'm 37-years-old and you don't think you'll get to play another Premier League game,' Hill told the club's official site. 'I'm glad that's off my back and I'm glad I played my part. 'It was a hell of a game to watch I suppose but we were disappointed in the first half, I don't think we really imposed ourselves. 'To go in 2-1 behind we could have kept our heads down and sunk, but we showed a lot of character and going 3-2 up you think you've got the precious three points in the bag but they scored a fantastic free kick in the end.'

Villa are 16th, three points above the relegation zone after missing the chance to put themselves further clear. They go to Tottenham on Saturday - boss Tim Sherwood's first return to White Hart Lane since he left as head coach last summer. But Sherwood dismissed any added pressure after failing to beat Rangers and insisted he is not giving much thought to his Spurs comeback. He said: 'There's always pressure on all the games you're going to play and who's to say we can't go to into those games and win? 'I don't think we're cut out to dig out results, we can't do what QPR did. We're going to play on the front foot.

        "article": "Sergio Perez fears 'a very painful year' lies ahead if Force India's roll out of their upgraded car this season proves a dud. Build-time pressure over the winter resulted in the Silverstone-based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace. The additional knock-on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team's B-spec model, which is now not due to be unveiled until the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.' For the team and the Mexican, who was 10th in the season-opening race in Australia - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in Malaysia recently, the current struggles are already tough to endure. Perez fears for Force India's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled McLaren duo of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in the Malaysia Grand Prix near the back of the grid . Perez finished 13th at Sepang and admits Force India are relying on their June upgrade to come good . 'It is frustrating knowing we don't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace. It's really hard,' Perez added. 'It is also really hard to keep motivated. Going into a race, knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage, is not the easiest for a driver. 'At the moment, on pure pace, it is quite difficult to make it into the points. We're quite far from the teams ahead of us. 'We are in a position where it's very easy to make mistakes, to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff. 'From now on we are going to have hard races, but it is what it is at the moment. We have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race. 'We're going to give 100 per cent and try to be there with whatever we have, to try to get into the points before we get the new package that can hopefully get us back into the points on pure pace.'",

        "article": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN)It took one Somali woman seven months and 4,000 miles to trek to Libya. From there, she hoped to cross the Mediterranean Sea so her baby could be born in Europe. She didn't get there. She was arrested as she was sailing north and is now one of 350 migrants being held in a facility just outside Tripoli. Other pregnant women fleeing repression have come to Libya -- many fleeing fighting that refuses to stop. They, like male migrants, are willing to risk their lives on crowded boats to make the final part of the trip. The Somali woman's baby, Sabrine, was born a week after she was detained. Libyan officials are in a quandary. The prison head admitted to CNN there is no system in place to send these people home, jail them or let them go. About one-third of the migrants are from Eritrea on the east coast of Africa. They denied they were heading to Europe and told CNN they just want to go home, which is several thousands of miles away. In one sense, they are fortunate, even though the time in prison seems like forever. They are alive. Many others have died when smugglers' ships sink. Bodies wash up on Libyan beaches. They are anonymous -- no IDs, no links to who they were and what was in their past that drove them to try the dangerous trip. In Malta, there are similar stories of death. On Thursday, the bare, stark caskets came in one by one on the shoulders of Maltese soldiers. The tears soon came along with them. That was the scene in a tent outside the Mater Dei Hospital in Valletta, Malta, a chance for citizens and dignitaries to remember 24 of what's thought to be hundreds of migrants killed when their crammed ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Almost all the other victims haven't been accounted for yet, with the presumption that their bodies remain trapped inside the 66-foot (20-meter) boat that capsized late Saturday roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Libya. Italian authorities have said that many of the estimated 850 aboard had been locked in the ship's lower levels with no way out. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The tragedy has prompted questions about the growing migrant crisis facing Europe, as well as about who is responsible for Saturday's tragedy. The Catania, Italy, prosecutor's office announced Tuesday that the vessel's 27-year-old captain, Mohammed Ali Malek, and crew member Mahmud Bikhit have been arrested on suspicion of \"reckless shipwreck, multiple manslaughter (and) abetting clandestine immigration\" for their roles in the disaster. Those questions still need to be answered. But Thursday, at least, was a day for reflection -- about lives snuffed out simply because people wanted a better life. \"This event reminds us that we are all immigrants and our life is a journey of migration,\" Imam Mohammed El Sadi said at Thursday's funeral. \"Our grandparents Adam and Eve, peace be onto them, emigrated from heaven to earth. We emigrated from our mothers' wombs to this world, and we will immigrate to the graves.\" The deaths are the latest illustration of the increasing flow of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East through the Mediterranean and into Europe -- assuming they survive the trip. Gemma Parkin, a spokeswoman for Save the Children, said that the number of migrants who have fled to find refuge in Europe has skyrocketed 70% this year over last, a dramatic rise that she attributed mostly to the deteriorating security situation in Libya. About 8% of the recorded migrants between January and April 19 of this year are children, Parkin said. Of those, 70% aren't unaccompanied by adults -- some of them as young as 9 years old. Such numbers represent only people rescued at sea or caught once they reach land. Frontex, the European Union's border management agency, says that many illegal immigrants get through without being detected; moreover, most of them come in legally via airports and then overstay their visas. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Tripoli and CNN's Steve Almasy and Greg Botelho wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Ingrid Formanek in Catania, Italy, contributed to this report.",

The British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. Members of the banned leftist group - known as the DHKP-C - took senior Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage last week. Both the prosecutor and the hostage takers were killed after a police shoot-out. Scroll down for video . Sick: Members of the banned leftist group - known as the DHKP-C - took senior Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage last week.\u00a0Both the prosecutor and the hostage takers were killed after a police shoot-out . Murderers: A handout photo provided by the Istanbul head prosecutor shows two hostage takers seconds after they entered the Istanbul Court House where\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz was later killed . A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' The DHKP-C is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US, EU and Turkey. Two members of the DHKP-C and the prosecutor they held hostage inside a courthouse in Istanbul died after the shootout. Police had negotiated with the gunmen for six hours before the violent end to the hostage situation, according to Istanbul police chief Selami Altinok. Pictures emerged of the hostage takers holding a gun to the prosecutor's head during the siege. Sadness: Thousands of people attended last Wednesday's funeral ceremony for Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz inside the main courthouse where he died the previous day . Grief: \u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried in vain to save his life. Pictured is his funeral the following day . Police had negotiated with the gunmen for six hours before the violent end to the hostage situation. Pictured are the thousands of people who turned out for Mehmet Selim Kiraz's funeral . Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of Kiraz held during the armed siege last week. Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. The prosecutor, identified by state television as Kiraz, was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and hospital officials later announced he had died. Private news agency Dogan reported police special forces had entered the building, which was evacuated. It was not clear how the assailants managed to get arms into the courthouse. Mr Kiraz was the prosecutor investigating the death of a teenager who was hit by a police gas canister fired during nationwide anti-government protests in 2013. The DHKP-C, which seeks a socialist state, has carried out sporadic attacks, including a suicide bombing on the US Embassy in 2013 that killed a security guard. The group was more active in the 1970s. Another attack: Just one day after the death of Kiraz, a woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters . Police HQ: Television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood . Armed: The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and a pistol. Local media said a man was also held . Just one day after the death of Kiraz, a woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters. A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement at the time. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. On the same day police separately detained a gunman who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election.",

        "article": "Despite being paraded as a prominent backer of Mr Miliband hours earlier, throughout the television debate on Thursday night she instead tweeted praise for Green Party leader Natalie Bennett . Ed Miliband faced yet more humiliation today as he lost the support of a plus-sized blogger just hours after she signed a high-profile letter backing him. Campaign chiefs had attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people \u2018from all walks of life\u2019. But the plan quickly unravelled as it was revealed the 100 'working people' supporting Mr Miliband included a benefit fraudster, a boss who has used zero-hours workers, affluent students and a string of union and party activists. Today the move continued to backfire spectacularly as another of the signatories appeared to switch her allegiance to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett. Callie Thorpe was listed on the letter supporting Mr Miliband as a receptionist, but online she also describes herself as a 'plus size style and lifestyle blogger, fan of lipsticks, food, travel and self love'. Despite being paraded as a prominent backer of Mr Miliband hours earlier, throughout the television debate on Thursday night she instead tweeted praise for Miss Bennett. She posted: 'I really like Natalie Bennett', before later writing: 'I honestly believe that Natalie Bennett was wonderful.' In a further snub to Mr Miliband, who she failed to tweet about, she added: 'The female party members were incredible.' The 25-year-old, who signed the letter saying the country needs 'a better plan for prosperity', has boasted on her blog about her exotic holidays. She wrote: \u2018Travelling the world has always been a passion of mine, especially Thailand and I thought I would share with you the best five weeks of my life hoping that I can impart some knowledge if you too, are looking to travel around Thailand or Cambodia.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) has faced further embarrassment today after plus-sized blogger Callie Thorpe Right) withdrew her support of a high-profile letter backing him .

She is a size 18 to 20. The signatories of the letter supporting Mr Miliband said they were \u2018all working people\u2019. They warned about the \u2018proliferation of zero-hours contracts\u2019, which they claimed were \u2018letting down Britain\u2019 and showed that \u2018we need a Labour Government to put working people first\u2019. But Labour removed the name of one of the signatories after she was exposed as Nigerian woman convicted of a \u00a327,000 benefit fraud. The blogger posted during the election debate (pictured) that she 'really liked Natalie Bennett', before later writing: 'I honestly believe that Natalie Bennett was wonderful' Others included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville, who were pictured on their Facebook pages smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Mr Pierce's mother, who lives in a \u00a31million house in Surrey, said her son had signed the letter despite knowing 'nothing about politics'. Several of the signatories were also exposed as Labour councillors and even an ex-MP. Miss Thorpe tonight wrote on Twitter that she had signed the letter 'as a woman who grew up on a council estate with a single parent income'.\u00a0She added: 'I work x2 jobs and feel passionately about supporting the most vulnerable in our society.'",

        "article": "A Ukip MEP has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a \u2018very strong leader\u2019 who has \u2018put Russia first\u2019. Diane James, Ukip\u2019s Justice Spokesman, also applauded Mr Putin's nationalist credentials and argued he was forced into invading Ukraine because of the European Union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked a row last year when he hailed Russian President as a \u2018brilliant operator'. Scroll down for video . Praising Putin: Diane James, Ukip's Justice Spokesperson applauded Russian President Vladimir Putin's nationalist credentials . Taking part in a women leaders' debate on LBC radio, Mrs James - who is considered a potential successor of Nigel Farage - said: \u2018Nigel went on record saying if you provoke the Russian bear you get a reaction. \u2018I admire him from the point of view that he\u2019s standing up for his country. He is very nationalist. \u2018He is a very strong leader. He is putting Russia first, and he has issues with the way the EU encouraged a change of government in the Ukraine which he felt put at risk a Russian population in that country,' she said. Mrs James was the Ukip candidate in the Eastleigh by-election and currently represents the south east of England in the European Parliament. Ukip leader Nigel Farage caused controversy in March 2014 after he admitted he admired Putin as a \u2018brilliant operator\u2019 for his stance on the Syrian conflict. However, unlike Mrs James, he clarified his view on Putin by adding: \u2018Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?\u2019 His comments followed the annexation of Crimea, but before the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russian-supported separatists. Mrs James told presenter Iain Dale (far left) that she admires Putin because he stands up for his country . Ukip smiles: Diane James is widely considered to be Nigel Farage's successor as the leader of Ukip . Mrs James' comments came as Ukip\u2019s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a \u2018rugby club on tour\u2019 with members who can be \u2018boorish\u2019 and \u2018chauvinistic\u2019. Patrick O\u2019Flynn, who is also the party\u2019s economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to \u2018work harder\u2019 as it is \u2018lagging\u2019 behind with female voters. As he launched the party\u2019s \u2018policies for women\u2019 alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and Mrs James, Mr O\u2019Flynn was forced to defend its \u2018blokeish\u2019 image under Nigel Farage. Mrs James' comments come as Ukip's campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said the party resembled a 'rugby club on tour' He said: \u2018Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. \u2018But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. \u2018We\u2019re a very fast-growing party, we\u2019re increasing our attraction \u2013 it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we\u2019re not maximising our support in every potential group. \u2018And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters \u2013 we still are, we\u2019ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.\u2019 The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a \u2018tampon tax\u2019. It also said it would give \u2018absolute, full and unconditional\u2019 support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are \u2018properly resourced\u2019. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is \u2018accepted cultural practice\u2019 for some of \u2018our ethnic compatriots\u2019. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party\u2019s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on \u2018lies\u2019 and \u2018myths\u2019 spread about the party. She said: \u2018I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. \u2018There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. \u2018Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.\u2019 Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as \u2018sluts\u2019. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women\u2019s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: \u2018I\u2019ve got so many women pregnant over the years.\u2019",

'The age of Little Foot has been highly debated,' said . geologist Darryl Granger of Purdue University in Indiana, whose . research appears in the journal Nature. The study found Little Foot, a member of the species . Australopithecus prometheus, lived at roughly the same time as . Australopithecus afarensis, the species whose most famous . fossil, known as Lucy, comes from Ethiopia. Scroll down for video .

The researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from the Sterkfontein Caves to gauge its age. The species was much bigger and taller than Lucy's, with gorilla-like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing. Like Lucy, Little Foot was female. Its hands were proportioned like ours, with a long thumb and . relatively short fingers and palm, unlike the elongated hands of . modern apes. Its legs were slightly longer than its arms, unlike . modern apes. Both species blended ape-like and human-like traits but with different features. The researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the . nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from the . Sterkfontein Caves to gauge its age. The findings may have important implications about the . evolutionary relationships among humankind's ancient relatives. Our species, Homo sapiens, appeared roughly 200,000 years . ago. Earlier members of the human genus, Homo, date back more . than 2 million years. Our genus was predated by other species on . the human family tree including various representatives of the . genus Australopithecus. Members of Lucy's species were contemporaries of Little . Foot, although Lucy herself lived about 500,000 years later. Like Lucy, Little Foot was female. The species was much . bigger and taller than Lucy's, with gorilla-like facial features . but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for . climbing, according to paleoanthropologists Ron Clarke and Kathy . Kuman of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The face of Little Foot, which has now been accurately dated for the first time. Its hands were proportioned like ours, with a long thumb and . relatively short fingers and palm, unlike the elongated hands of . modern apes. Its legs were slightly longer than its arms, unlike . modern apes. Clarke and Kuman noted similarities in facial structure and . some teeth between Little Foot and the later human relative . Paranthropus, indicating Little Foot's species may have been . ancestral to Paranthropus or a close cousin. The new date for Little Foot indicates Lucy's species was . not the only one that could have given rise to later members of . the human family tree, Clarke and Kuman said. 'The fact, therefore, that we have at least two . (Australopithecus) species living at the same time in different . parts of Africa, (about) 3.67 million years ago, raises the . question of how many other species there may have been which . have not yet been discovered,' Clarke and Kuman said by email. The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' said Darryl Granger, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue. The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' Granger said. 'We double-and triple-checked our results, running the measurement again and again.' The gas-filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium-26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector. This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. some of the other material found at the site: Stone tools found at a different level of the Sterkfontein cave also were dated at 2.18 million years old, making them among the oldest known stone tools in South Africa. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said. 'We double-and triple-checked our results, running the measurement again and again.' The gas-filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium-26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector. This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. Ron Clarke, a professor in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University in South Africa holds the Little Foot skull, among the oldest hominid skeletons ever dated at 3.67 million years old, according to an advanced dating method.  The date places Little Foot as an older relative of Lucy, a famous Australopithecus skeleton dated at 3.2 million years old that was found in Ethiopia. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. The new findings suggest Little Foot roamed the Earth at around the same time as the famed 3.2-million-year-old Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis - shown in a reconstruction above. When discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia, Lucy was the only skeleton of the species known; she would've stood 3.5 feet (about a meter) tall. Currently, more than 300 individuals of this species, which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago, have been uncovered . Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said. 'One of the reasons I came to Purdue was to be a part of the revolutionary science that can be done when such resources are applied to challenging problems. These results highlight what can be accomplished through a collaboration that spans multiple disciplines. It couldn't have happened without the unique skills and resources each person brought to the table.' INRAP's French researcher Laurent Bruxelles shows Little Foot, a fossil with both ape-like and human features found in a cave at the Sterkfontein site, near Johannesburg. The 'Cradle of Life' is one of eight World Heritage Sites in South Africa . In 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the . discovery of Australopithecus sediba - thought to be an early human . ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics . The world-renowned Sterkfontein Caves is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world. It is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as 'Mrs Ples', and the almost complete hominid skeleton called 'Little Foot'. Granger's original attempt was the first time aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil. He developed the method in 1997 and first used it to study changes in mountains, rivers and other geological formations. Because of their very slow rate of decay, these particular radioisotopes allow dating to reach back millions of years, much further in history than the more commonly known carbon-14 dating that can only stretch back about 50,000 years, he said. Only a small amount of the radioisotopes remain in the quartz after millions of years, and it can only be measured by the ultrasensitive analysis of accelerator mass spectrometry. 'We had given up and nearly walked away from the project thinking we had failed,' Granger said. 'Then the new detector was completed, and we thought we would give it one last try.'

Dayna Dobias, 19, from Downers Grove was born with cerebral palsy, but she hopes to inspire others with her enthusiastic videos. 'I've gotten bullied because of it and I get people all the time, staring and so it's definitely made things difficult in my life,' Dayna told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented by the television, film and the fashion industry . Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging. The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created. Last year the teenager produced another dancing clip with her strutting her stuff to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off. Inspirational: The Illinois teen who suffers from cerebal palsy has created a video in which she dances . Don't judge: People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' Dayna says . 'People like to define me based on disability. People just look at me and think, oh that's just the girl with cerebral palsy,' she said. 'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.'

        "article": "Teenager Ben Gibson had just seen his Middlesbrough side knocked out in the Champions League group stage when the email landed from club chairman \u2013 Uncle Steve \u2013 that he had been fired. That, of course, was the virtual world of Football Manager. On Friday, Boro defender Gibson \u2013 now 22 - can help steer his uncle's club back towards the big time for real. The England Under 21 star was a kid in the playground when his dad's brother was splashing the cash on Juninho, Alen Boksic and Gaizka Mendieta, before that there had been the likes of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Emerson and Paul Gascoigne. Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson, 22, is dreaming of a return to the Premier League for his boyhood club . His uncle, Boro chairman Steve Gibson, has overseen some of the most significant times in the club's history . Midfielder Juninho (right) is widely considered to be one of Middlesbrough's greatest-ever players, and starred in Gibson's foray into computerised football management during his teenage years . Steve Gibson helped save the Teessiders from liquidation in 1986 and eight years later took control, his investment seeing them win the Carling Cup in 2004 and reach the final of the UEFA Cup in 2006. But six consecutive seasons outside of the Premier League has proved a financial strain. That is why Gibson readily labels the televised clash at Norwich City \u2013 one point above them and second in the Championship - as the biggest match in the club's history. 'The way the Premier League is and the gap financially makes this our biggest game ever,' said the centre-back. 'If we get back in the Premier League it's different to the last time we were there. It has more of an impact, financially, than what the cup finals did. 'It's \u00a3100m for going up, that is irreplaceable. It will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the Carling Cup.' Nunthorpe-born Gibson is a lifelong Boro fan. He was there when they beat Bolton at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to lift the first trophy in the club's history and again in Eindhoven two years later when Sevilla ran out 4-0 winners. He eclipsed all of that, however, in his bedroom at home. 'I was always Middlesbrough boss on Football Manager \u2013 and I was pretty good,' he recalled. Middlesbrough captain Gareth Southgate (left) leads the club's celebrations after winning the 2004 Carling Cup . Sevilla's\u00a0Adriano Correia (left) shoots during the 2006 UEFA Cup final, in which his side beat Boro 4-0 . 'My uncle always gave me loads to spend! The best I got was the group stage of the Champions League. We got knocked out without making the second round and he gave me the bullet! 'But in the real world I leave all that business to him. And if we do go up then I'll be hoping that he keeps hold of me!' There is no danger of that not happening. Gibson has been a rock at the heart of the division's best defence \u2013 they have conceded 10 fewer than any rival \u2013 and will be part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for this summer's Euros in the Czech Republic. Perhaps, then, promotion and an impressive showing for his country will silence all accusations of nepotism. 'I don't mind people saying that I'm only here because of my uncle, it motivates me,' he said. 'You would think playing for England kills that talk anyway \u2013 because I don't think my uncle picks the England squad. 'But I'm used to it. I've had it all my life and it drives me on.' Were Gibson ever to let up, then his Boro-supporting pals would be onto him long before his uncle. They are even more anxious than he is as the tightest promotion race in Championship history nears its conclusion. 'My mates are stressing out more than me,' said Gibson. 'It's better for me because it's in my hands. After every game I come in and it' s like heart-attack material in our whatsapp group \u2013 it's incredible. 'But they believe in us and that's massive. They feel we deserve that promotion. 'And I think my uncle deserves it too. He's been amazing. His loyalty and what he has put in deserves reward with promotion back to the Premier League.' Given the ambition of his uncle, perhaps then Ben can aim to right the wrongs of his previous adventure in the Champions League.

        "article": "(CNN)Saudi Arabia has executed a second Indonesian maid despite protests from Jakarta, which is itself facing fierce criticism for its failure to heed calls for clemency for a number of foreigners on death row. The Indonesian government summoned the Saudi ambassador to the foreign ministry on Thursday after learning that 37-year-old Karni Bt. Medi Tarsim had been beheaded, without official warning. Karni was sentenced to death in March 2013 for killing her employer's four-year-old child. She was the second Indonesian domestic worker executed by the Saudis this week, following the death of Siti Zaenab Bt. Duhri Rupa on Tuesday -- the execution again carried out with Indonesian officials receiving no prior warning. \"That is our main issue. It's not that suddenly there was an execution. We didn't know when it would take place. Still, we took over a hundred steps to try to free (Siti) from execution,\" said Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Siti, 47, was convicted of killing her employer's wife in 1999, but the death penalty was delayed until the youngest of the victim's sons reached puberty and was old enough to consider requesting her pardon. He didn't. Rights groups say they suspect Siti was mentally ill and cast aspersions on claims she had confessed to the crime. Amnesty International also said reports suggested she had been abused while working in the victim's home. \"Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,\" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at Amnesty International. In a statement, the Indonesian government said the protection of its citizens abroad was a \"priority\" and listed the attempts it had made to help Siti, including providing legal aid, writing letters to the Saudi King and \"continuous efforts... to ask for forgiveness from the family.\" Indonesia said in many cases its efforts had worked. From July 2011 to the end of March this year, it said it had \"successfully freed\" 238 of its citizens from the death penalty. One of those was Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad who was sentenced to death in 2011 after reportedly admitting to killing her 70-year-old employer and stealing $10,000. Satinah claimed she acted in self-dense. Days before her scheduled execution, the Indonesian government stepped in with so-called \"blood money\" of 7 million Saudi riyals -- at the time worth about $1.8 million. Satinah was spared. Indonesia's efforts to save its own citizens does not sit well with advocates who are seeking the same mercy for foreigners languishing on Indonesia's death row. Two of the most high profile cases are Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, Australians convicted of attempting to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. Friday marks the 10-year anniversary of their arrest with seven other people -- members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" -- who are currently serving lengthy sentences in Indonesian prisons. As the alleged ringleaders, Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death, and denied clemency from President Jokowi Widodo, a decision being challenged through the country's Constitutional Court. \"If Indonesia wants to effectively protect Indonesians from the death penalty abroad, Indonesia should also abolish the death penalty here,\" said Todung Mulya Lubis, one of the men's lawyers. Chan, 31, and Sukumaran -- who also turns 34 on Friday -- are currently incarcerated on Nusakambangan Island in preparation for their execution but no date has been set. Human Rights Watch called on Widodo to suspend all planned executions in Indonesia -- as the previous government did between 2008 and 2013.  No executions were carried out in 2014, but earlier this year, six people -- including five foreigners -- faced the firing squad. \"The executions of two Indonesian citizens in Saudi Arabia in a single week should be a turning point on the subject of death penalty in Indonesia,\" said Andreas Harsono, the Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"Please stop the lecture of sovereignty. It is so old fashioned.\" Before news of the second execution emerged on Thursday,  the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press briefing to denounce the Saudi action. When asked whether Jakarta's complaints smacked of hypocrisy, given the country's refusal to spare foreigners on death row, spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said: \"If you read our constitution, it is the job, the role of the government to protect its citizens, right? So it's not a double standard.\" \"On the issue of death penalty, we can have a long debate whether it is against human rights or it is morally wrong or right. That's a whole other discussion, that's a whole other argument, but what we're saying now here is we are implementing our laws and we are adhering to our constitution that we have to protect our citizens abroad.\"",

        "article": "Are you partial to a prawn mayo sandwich, drawn by the lure of a shrimp cocktail on a menu? Once only enjoyed by the affluent, prawns are now a healthy, cheap option filling supermarkets, sandwich bars and restaurants across the world. But have you ever stopped to think about where the ones you're eating have come from? Forget sun-kissed seas and a lone fisherman casting his nets into the Indian Ocean to haul in his catch. For a new report shows that idyllic picture could not be further from the truth. A new study by experts at Consumer Reports in the US has found 60 per cent of packaged prawns tested were found to contain traces of harmful bacteria . Experts in the US found the majority of the shrimp sold on supermarket shelves arrive there after starting life on vast prawn farms in south east Asia. Many prawns sold in the UK also come from places such as Thailand and Indonesia. They tested 342 packages of frozen shrimp - 284 raw and 58 cooked samples - from large, chain supermarkets and natural food stores in 27 cities across the US. And their investigation revealed 60 per cent of the prawns were found to have traces of  harmful bacteria, including E.coli, which can cause violent food poisoning. Furthermore, in 11 samples researchers detected antibiotics, and seven samples tested positive for MRSA - an infection that is resistant to a number of antibiotics. Other traces of bacteria included salmonella and vibrio, both of which can cause serious food poisoning. Dr Urvashi Rangan, executive director of Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Centre, warned: 'Bacteria and algae can begin to grow and disease can set in, prompting farmers to use drugs and other chemicals that can remain on the shrimp and seep into the surrounding environment. 'Vibrio is the most common cause of food poisoning from eating raw oysters. 'And even though most bacteria on shrimp would be killed during the cooking process, our test results raise real questions about how shrimp is raised, processed, and regulated.' Scientists found traces of E.coli, MRSA, salmonella and vibrio - a major cause of food poisoning . Responding to the discovery of MRSA, Dr Michael Crupain, director of the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Centre, said: 'It's spread through contact, so if MRSA gets on your skin while you're preparing raw shrimp, it can potentially cause an infection, especially if you have an abrasion or cut.' A medium-sized shrimp farm in South-East Asia can produced close to a million pounds of prawns every year, a 'powerful incentive for farmers to maximse production', the report notes. The vast majority of prawns eaten on these shores come from such farms in India, Indonesia and Thailand. There, prawns are 'farmed' in huge industrial tanks, or shallow, man-made ponds that can stretch for acres. In some cases, 150 shrimp can occupy a single square metre. They are typically fed commercial pellets, some of which contain antibiotics to ward off disease. If the ponds are not carefully managed, 'a sludge of faecal matter, chemicals and excess food can build up and decay'. And wastewater can be 'periodically discharged' into nearby waterways. The experts advise wild shrimp, a number of samples of which were also tested, appear to be worth the higher prices. The report reveals: 'Of all the shrimp we tested, they were among the least likely to harbour any kind of bacteria or contain chemicals.' But, it is worth considering the effects on the environment, marine scientists warn. Amanda Keledjian, from the not-for-profit conservation group, Oceana, said: 'Nets dragged along the ocean floor can severely damage the sea bottom and anything that lives there.' The report goes on to state, that while estimates vary, between one and three pounds of other species, including endangered sea turtles, can be killed for every pound of shrimp caught in the wild. A large number of the prawns available on supermarket started life in vast prawn farms in Thailand, India and Indonesia. They are farmed in huge industrial tanks, or in shallow ponds, like those pictured in Krabi, above . If the ponds are not carefully managed, 'a sludge of faecal matter, chemicals and excess food can build up'. Experts said on the face of their findings it is better to opt for wild prawns over their farmed cousins . So faced with the facts, how can consumers make the right choices when it comes to which shrimp to put in their cocktail? Marianne Cufone, an environmental solicitor and executive director at Recirculating Farms Coalition, explains how you can spot a farmed prawn from their wild cousins. 'Wild shrimp often vary in size, shape, and colour because they don't all have identical genetics,' she said. 'Batches of farmed shrimp often all hatch at the same time, eat the same food and live in the same environment, so they're more likely to look the same.' And her second tip, is to look for evidence of prawn faeces. 'Look for poop, or what is politely called a 'vein',' she added. 'Frequently, shrimp farmers stop feeding shrimp before harvesting them so that the vein empties. 'If you see a dark line there's a better chance it's a real wild shrimp.'",

        "article": "Graham Leonard, pictured leaving court after admitting endangering an aircraft . A passenger who hijacked a plane's tannoy system while drunk to sing karaoke and then caused an airport to be evacuated could be handed a jail term. Graham Leonard, who was returning to Scotland after attending a Manchester United football match, grabbed the PA microphone on the private charter flight and burst into song for his fellow football fans after drinking beer and gin on match day. And after frustrating the cabin crew with his antics during the flight - including throwing a hot towel at one - he then caused part of an airport to be evacuated after deliberately setting off the fire alarm on arrival in Aberdeen. Sheriff Edward Savage said he was keeping 'all options open' and Mr Kelly to find out what impact a jail sentence would have on his client. 'I'm not entirely satisfied given the very serious nature of these matters that a financial penalty will reflect how serious these matters are,' said Mr Savage. 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I'm keeping all options open.' Leonard, 46, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where he admitted endangering the aircraft and its passengers as well as setting off the airport alarm knowing there was no blaze. The court heard that Leonard, from Newmacher, in Aberdeenshire, had been part of a group of Scots fans that had chartered an Eastern Airways flight to jet down to watch United's 3-0 league win over Tottenham on March 15 this year. They had been drinking beer and gin and tonics before leaving Aberdeen Airport, then spent the day meeting former players at a corporate event in a hotel in Manchester. Fiscal depute Karen Dow said that Leonard was one of three passengers that missed their ride back to the airport after the drunken day out. When he did eventually board the 9:17pm private flight from Manchester he started causing trouble for the cabin crew. Leonard was flying on a priavet charter Eastern Airways flight into Aberdeen Airport (file photo) Ms Dow said: 'During the journey the accused approached the complainer to ask if he could sing a song on the public address system. 'She said no and that was not permitted. The accused went to the PA mic and started singing. 'The complainer approached him and told him to stop and asked him to return to his seat. 'His behaviour persisted. This was frustrating for the complainer as it was part of the communication system used by the captain.' The court heard that the businessman, who owns a painting and decorating firm in Aberdeen, also repeatedly refused to sit down before throwing a hot hand towel at one of the stewardesses. Graham Leonard was returning to Scotland after watching Manchester United at Old Trafford, pictured . On arrival at Aberdeen International Airport he was seen 'talking' into the airport's PA system then activating a fire alarm. Around 40 people had to be evacuated from the area and two units from Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were called out to the false alarm. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said his client was 'mortified' about his conduct but asked the sheriff to consider a financial penalty. He said: 'In the sober light of day he is extremely apologetic. The full extent of what he had done did not become clear until the next day when he spoke to others. After landing at Aberdeen Airport, Leonard set the fire alarm off causing an evacuation . 'He is ordinarily a responsible business man. 'He is a regular on this charter plane which goes down to follow the fortunes of Manchester United. 'They had drank a mixture of beer and gin and tonic before embarking on the flight down. There was a special corporate event at hotel in Manchester with ex-players. 'He got carried away. There is no excuse for his behaviour.' Sentence was deferred for reports. Leonard was ordained to appear next month. Speaking after the case called, he said: 'I'm deeply sorry about what happened. 'It was just a drunken day out that went wrong. I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused. I'm deeply embarrassed about it.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "He's been mocked for his inability to eat a bacon sandwich properly and likened to cartoon character Wallace - but that didn't prevent Ed Miliband from coming top in the sex appeal stakes during last night's debate. Moments after the Labour leader finished speaking, fans took to Twitter to coo adoringly about his 'sexy grey tie' and his smouldering looks. One rather breathless Tweet read: 'Miliband is totally talking to me and no one else, you sexy beast. Keep staring down the camera Ed! #leadersdebate' Scroll down for video . So hot right now: Ed Miliband's looks proved a hit with Twitter users during last night's debate . Another, Holly Ashby, asked why no one had asked Mr Miliband a question about his hair, complaining: . 'Why has no one asked about Ed Miliband's sexy Rogue-From-X-Men grey streak? It's all I care about tbh.' One fan even likened Miliband to Hansel, a character from modelling comedy Zoolander, tweeting: . 'Ed seducing the ladies with his patter. He's so hot right now, just like Hansel #leadersdebate #zoolander' Another, named Chloeee, added: 'Ed Miliband really is hot.' Shortly afterwards, a Vine of Mr Miliband smouldering sultrily into the camera took the internet by storm, while popular website Buzzfeed took note of the phenomenon and published a piece rounding up the best romantic Tweets. But Mr Miliband, 45, who spent the day after the debate in Blackpool with his family, isn't the first politician to find himself on the receiving end of attention based on his good looks. Family day out: Mr Miliband has spent the day enjoying fish and chips with his family in Blackpool .

Impressed: A viewer finds herself enjoying the sight of Mr Miliband's saturnine looks . Enjoying it: Two watching women compare their notes on the Labour leader . Favourite bit: One Twitter user declared her love for Mr Miliband's 'Rogue-From-X-Men' grey streak . Handsome: Another Twitter user was surprised to find herself fancying the Labour leader . Last October, Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikstr\u00f6m, 30, found himself bombarded by risqu\u00e9 messages from adoring Turkish fans after making a visit to the country. Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikstr\u00f6m, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, said at the time that he was 'honoured' by all the attention. Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can\u2019t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.' Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 48, is another politician famous for her glamorous looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan J\u00f8rgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies. Impressed: Viewers appeared to appreciate Mr Miliband's 'sexy tie' and the grey streak in his hair . Seductive: Another compared Mr Miliband to Hansel from Zoolander, adding: 'He's so hot right now' Was it deliberate? One Twitter user appeared less convinced by Mr Miliband's smoulder . Swoon: A Twitter user describes Mr Miliband as a 'sexy beast' and exhorts him to keep looking at the camera . Sexy MP: Swedish health minister\u00a0Gabriel Wikstr\u00f6m has proved a big hit with the ladies . Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikstr\u00f6m himself, is 36-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his handsome face as he is for his politics. And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has several of its own. Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 40, at the top of its looks list while running. MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36, . Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.

        "article": "An Ohio couple have been found dead in an apparent murder-suicide in their stateroom aboard a Holland America cruise ship docked in Puerto Rico. The unidentified man and woman were in their 50s and from Cleveland, police Sgt. Ricardo Cruz told The Associated Press. Cruz said blood was found in the cabin aboard the MS Ryndam, but it was unclear how the couple died. A team of FBI investigators boarded the MS Ryndam after a Cleveland couple were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide as the ship docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico . The bodies were taken off the ship Thursday night by a team of FBI crime scene investigators. Authorities will not say how the couple died . The cruise is expected to get back underway on Friday as it heads to the Virgin Islands . 'We don't know yet whether an object was used or what the motive was,' he said. He said the ship's cleaning crew found the bodies when they checked on the couple after not seeing them for a while. The FBI has taken over the investigation. It was unclear exactly when the couple died. The ship departed Tampa, Florida, on Sunday for a two-week cruise in the southern Caribbean. It stopped in Key West on Monday and then spent two days at sea before docking in historic Old San Juan on Thursday, Holland America spokesman Erik Elvejord said. Passengers say they had no idea of what had happened - only that they had to wait a long time to disembark from the ship . Passengers were horrified when they learned what had happened in a stateroom aboard the ship . 'We are terribly saddened by this tragic event,' the company said in a statement.

He said the crew had roped off part of the ship and hung a sheet in the hallway as passengers disembarked around noon. Other baffled passengers said they were never told what happened aboard the ship - only that there was a big holdup as they tried to disembark when the ship docked at San Jaun, according to WAPA-TV.

        "article": "They are the homes provided  to give those less fortunate members of our society a roof over their heads. But with the cost of maintenance and repairs to damaged public housing nearing $13 million a year in NSW alone, the State Government has had enough and is planning to make tenants pay a bond before they move in. Communities Minister Brad Hazzard said it was a 'very likely possibility' the plan would be implemented in the near future. 'The critical argument for it is that at the moment the maintenance costs, including damage from poor tenancy, are in the order of approximately $12-13 million per year,' Mr Hazzard told Daily Mail Australia. A picture from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services shows damage to public housing . Public housing tenants will  pay a bond under a NSW government plan to recoup losses from trashed properties . The state's new Community Services Minister Brad Hazzard said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer-funded housing had hit $12 million . Mr Hazzard added that he was unsure as to why public housing tenants have never been made to pay a bond similar to that paid by private renters . 'I'd like to see at least a reasonable portion of that money saved and put into more public housing. We have very long public housing tenancy waiting lists.' Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the fact public housing tenants don't pay a bond when consulting with workers in the field. He added that introducing a bond was not a new idea or 'rocket science'. 'My job is to make sure I use taxpayers money very wisely and maximise the opportunities for public housing for other people that wait years,' Mr Hazzard said. The Minister\u00a0said it would most likely be a one month bond, paid off over six months to a year. He said it would be possible to make exceptions in certain circumstance \u2013 for example women escaping domestic violence. Mr Hazzard added public housing tenants were already liable for damage but 'they don't have the money'. Pictured is a trashed public housing property in Hornsby, in the northern suburbs of Sydney . Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the issue when consulting with workers in the field . Damage can also be seen to the garage door, and the backyard is piled up with junk . 'Generally it's very hard to retrospectively try to get money from tenants when they've moved out,' he said. 'This is about sending a forward message, a very clear and upfront message, that you will be responsible for the damage.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties. 'Tenants are always liable for the damage they cause, the question of the bond is really just about making sure there's a little bit of money there so landlords can have ready access to money,' Mr Cutcher said. 'I don't think the government should be looking at that in the same way as private landlord, who might struggle to cover costs. 'The government landlord isn't going to find themselves in a situation where they're going to be short of cash.' Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants. Green mouldy bread and stacks of filthy dishes seen piling up in the kitchen that hasn't been cleaned . Mr Hazzard said the bond would be able to be paid in instalments. 'They may not have the money to pay it in one hit, that's understandable,' he said . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said. 'Tenants are usually very happy to have a social housing property, something they can afford, and it sure beats homelessness so they'll look after it on the whole. 'Problems occur when properties are left vacant for too long, and that's not an issue that can be solved by hitting tenants up for more money.' Mr Cutcher added: 'Households who are entering social housing tenancy are facing a number of challenges, and one of those challenges is necessarily a financial one. 'And to place an additional financial burden on people under those circumstances should be a difficult decision for a minister to make.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties . Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants, when houses were sometimes vandalised or left vacant for long periods of time . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said .",

        "article": "John\u00a0Carver has called on the advice and support of former Newcastle managers Alan Shearer and Alan Pardew as tensions grow between the club and its fanbase. Supporters are planning to boycott today\u2019s game at home to Spurs in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner Mike Ashley. Carver was in the dugout alongside Pardew at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3-0 victory over Cardiff. Pardew was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle boss John Carver is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors . Alan Pardew was in charge of Newcastle from 2010 to January this year, when he left for Crystal Palace . Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, the club's record goal-scorer, also had a brief stint as manager . Newcastle fans are planning to protest against owner Mike Ashley for a perceived lack of ambition . Sunday's protests will take place outside of the stadium, but Carver \u2013 who, in fairness, has been left with a depleted and disinterested squad - could nonetheless find himself the target should his side fall to a sixth straight defeat. Carver, though, accepts that he must take criticism and has spoken to the likes of Pardew and close friend Shearer, who was relegated as boss in 2009, for words of encouragement. \u2018Some of the advice I\u2019ve had has been excellent. It\u2019s definitely changed me as a person in how I\u2019ve dealt with things because, in the past, I would have reacted to what people have said and some of the things that have been written,\u2019 he said. \u2018Both Alans have excellent experience at it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m listening to what they are saying. Without a shadow of a doubt they have helped me through this. \u2018We are not through it yet but they have been excellent for me, along with many other people in the game.\u2019 He added: \u2018But the club realise the situation I\u2019m in and they realise that it\u2019s a difficult one, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced they are going to have to invest. \u2018Whether it\u2019s me or whether it's Sir Alex Ferguson doing this job, they would need investment.\u2019 Carver, meanwhile, does not expect a repeat of the poison of 12 months ago when they take on Spurs. \u2018The Cardiff game was one of the strangest atmospheres I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u2019 he said. \u2018We got through it in the end. I hope it won\u2019t be as difficult an atmosphere this time. Toon fans are planning to boycott the next home game with Spurs and have designed anti-Ashley leaflets . Newcastle players are put through their paces in training ahead of the home game with Spurs on Sunday . Newcastle winger Remy Cabella strikes a shot at goal during a training session ahead of the Spurs match . \u2018I don\u2019t think it will be, I think it will be a different type of protest. The fact that people are staying away, the people who come into the stadium will be behind the team because they understand where we are and everyone will be in it together.\u2019 And Carver believes that the home double-header with Spurs and Swansea will determine how the rest of their season plays out. \u2018I think these next two could define the season, because if we don\u2019t pick up results it just adds a bit more pressure,\u2019 he added. \u2018Sometimes pressure can take over and we don\u2019t want to leave ourselves in that situation.\u2019",

Monica McDermott, 41, could not walk straight when police stopped her black Lexus on a road in Macclesfield, Cheshire. The mother-of-one refused to give a breath sample after coming to a halt on\u00a0Churchill Way and had to be restrained when she tried to climb out of a police patrol car, a court heard. Monica McDermott, centre, during her modelling days. The 41-year-old had to be restrained by police after she was arrested for drink-driving. When officers breathalyzed her she was three times over the limit . McDermott, now aged 41, pleaded guilty to drink driving at Macclesfield Magistrates' court. She told the court she had drank a bottle of wine while her son was away on a trip, adding: 'I was lonely... I got myself in a state' When police finally managed to breathalyse her, she was three times the limit. McDermott, who works for a marketing company, pleaded guilty to drink driving when she appeared at Macclesfield Magistrates' court. It came after she avoided prison in 2012 when she crashed her car in nearby Alderley Edge while four times the legal limit. She was banned from driving for two years. Monica McDermott (pictured) could not walk straight when police stopped her Lexus on a road in Macclesfield, Cheshire . Prosecuting, Debbie Byrne said a police officer had to use an incapacitating spray when McDermott tried to get out of the police car. She told the court: 'Police received information about a black Lexus driving all over the road and nearly hitting cars. 'The officer turned on the emergency lights but the car made no attempt to stop. He drove diagonally to block her way. 'She crept the car forward like she was trying to drive off. He reached inside to turn the engine off. When she got out she struggled to walk in a straight line. 'She refused to give a breath sample and tried to get out of the police car. The officer used captor spray and called officers to restrain her.' McDermott, of Macclesfield, told magistrates she had been drinking more because she felt isolated after moving home. She said: 'My son was away on a trip and I was lonely. I had been drinking in the afternoon and got myself in a state. My friend said to go around and stay the night. 'I'd had a bottle of wine but thought I'd left enough time and would be ok. I couldn't believe I got in this mess again. 'I could have harmed someone. I'm embarrassed and ashamed.' Probation officer Mike Isherwood said McDermott has had a series of traumatic life experiences. Macclesfield Magistrates' Court (pictured) banned McDermott for driving for four years, but she escaped jail . Adrian Long, chairman of the bench, said: 'We've listened to what you and Mr Isherwood said but it was a very high reading and you have a previous conviction.' She was given an 18-month community order, alcohol rehabilitation programme, 120 hours unpaid work and was banned from driving for four years. Probation officer Mike Isherwood said: 'Her experiences in life have been chaotic. I don't think she'd cope well in prison. I've not seen anyone with such low mood.'",

But the suspect reportedly proceeded to get in his car and pull out of the parking lot before being stopped by deputies.

He's currently being held in the Erie County jail with his bail set at $1,000. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. Silverthorn was deemed guilty this week for driving over the limit and crashing his car into the Niagara River on December 29.

        "article": "The disabled pensioner who received donations from around the world after being beaten by a drug addict outside his home has got the keys to a new house. Alan Barnes, who is partially sighted and just 4ft 6in tall, was left too scared to return to his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear earlier this year after he was knocked to the ground by mugger Richard Gatiss. The crime shocked Britain and led to a fund being set up by local beautician Katie Cutler, 21, which raised \u00a3330,000. Mr Barnes, 67, was today handed the keys to his new two-bedroom terrace house where he says he will feel safer. Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes picked up the keys for his new home today after strangers raised \u00a3300,000 . Mr Barnes said it felt 'fantastic' to be in his new home as he showed off its modern kitchen . The 67-year-old said that he felt safer in the two-bedroom terraced property which he was able to buy after receiving donations from around the world . 'It's fantastic to finally be in the house after all this time,' he said. 'I was living a bit further up the hill before but this house is better and more handy when I need to go the Co-op and the shops. 'I haven't shown Katie the house yet but I'm looking forward to telling her about it. 'It's lovely to have my independence back. I'm looking forward to seeing the locals again and having a chat with them.' The \u00a3150,000 property boasts two bedrooms, a spacious living room, modern kitchen and large bathroom. It also has an outside barbecue area for entertaining and is just a short walk from the local shops of his native Low Fell, Gateshead. Mr Barnes now plans to use the remainder of the donated money to furnish his new home. The Victorian terrace is a\u00a0far cry from his previous address, a sparse one-bed bungalow with no garden. Mr Barnes said that it was 'lovely to get his independence back' after picking up the keys to his new home . Mr Barnes said he was 'looking forward' to telling beautician Katie Cutler, who launched the fund, all about his new home . Mr Barnes said he was 'grateful' to everyone who helped him get the property, including Miss Cutler, pictured . 'I'm about 15 minutes away from my other house but it's down lots of different streets and turns as well,' said the pensioner. 'I think I'll go for a walk tonight round the area and get my bearings again. 'I've had a couple of visitors and my sister brought me over today, to help me move in. It has been a busy day. 'I'm very grateful still to everyone who helped me get this house, especially Katie. 'I'm glad I've put the money to good use. 'I haven't spent it all in case I need some extra to refurbish the house.' Mr Barnes, who was born with disabilities after his mother contracted German measles while she was pregnant, had previously told of his plans to move near Ms Cutler. He wanted to make sure the pair, who have become close friends since the incident, could stay in touch. Richard Gatiss, 25, was jailed for four years at Newcastle Crown Court for targeting Mr Barnes . 'I considered where Katie lives but after thinking about it there's two reasons I haven't,' he said. 'One was I would've had to depend on my family to do things and I didn't know if Katie would be moving somewhere else so I thought just take this option and go to Low Fell.' He also revealed dreams of going on a break to Barbados. Earlier this month Richard Gatiss, 25, was jailed for four years at Newcastle Crown Court for targeting Mr Barnes to fund his addiction. During the attack in January, Gatiss crept up on Mr Barnes in a dark alley while the pensioner was putting his bin out. When he was arrested they found his DNA on his 67-year-old victim. Gatiss told police he was so desperate for drug money he would have 'targeted anyone'.",

        "article": "Disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman (pictured) is said to have played the race card to silence opponents - and his deputy today reiterated claims there is deep seated racism in the borough of Tower Hamlets, in east London . A deputy of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on \u2018institutional racism\u2019. Oliur Rahman, who took over from the deposed leader yesterday, insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. His comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly \u2018played the race card\u2019 to silence critics. The two men \u2013 who are not related \u2013 are both members of the Tower Hamlets First party. Political opponents said they were playing the same \u2018cracked record\u2019 by seeking to blame racism and Islamophobia for their problems. Oliur Rahman told the BBC: \u2018If people say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism. \u2018If people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that\u2019s their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion.\u2019 On Thursday, electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC found that Lutfur Rahman, 49, and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of \u2018ghost voters\u2019, forging postal votes, bribing Muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists. He found that all the councillors from the Tower Hamlets First party were elected corruptly. Oliur Rahman, 34, a former councillor for George Galloway\u2019s Respect party but now a Tower Hamlets First councillor, emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections. He said: \u2018Following the verdict, I have assumed the executive role within the council, until a mayoral election is held.\u2019 Peter Golds, the leader of the Tory group in Tower Hamlets, said: \u2018Oliur Rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough, but I don\u2019t think he gets it. \u2018It\u2019s ludicrous to play the race card again. They roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens. The real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of Tower Hamlets First. \u2018They\u2019ve got one cracked record, that any criticism of them is Islamophobic and racist. Now they\u2019re playing it again, despite the court case. Nothing has changed.\u2019 Lutfur Rahman, who was Britain\u2019s first elected Muslim mayor, has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the Election Court\u2019s decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud. Supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing. Police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election, which will be re-run in June. Lutfur Rahman, a Bangladesh-born former Labour council leader, has been banned from running for public office, or even voting, for five years. Four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the Electoral Commission had failed to act. Andy Erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with\u00a0Angela Moffat and Azmal Hussein (pictured left to right) - said Oliur Rahman was in 'complete denial' The group was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket. Mr Erlam said Lutfur Rahman\u2019s supporters \u2013 including Oliur Rahman \u2013 were in \u2018complete denial\u2019. He added: \u2018They are still claiming Rahman didn\u2019t do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected High Court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence. \u2018It makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a \u00a31.3billion budget of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u2019",

        "article": "Labour leader Harold Wilson secretly lobbied the BBC to change the time of popular comedy Steptoe and Son on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show instead of supporting his candidates. According to new archive footage held by the BBC, Mr Wilson went to the home of BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene and told him the show could cost him 20 seats. Mr Wilson was leader of the opposition and was seeking to oust the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas Home. The Labour leader thought the planned repeat of the sit-com starring Harry H Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell would hit them badly. Scroll down for video . The Labour Party was afraid that its supporters would stay at home and watch a repeat of Steptoe and Son featuring Harry H Corbett, left, and Wilfrid Brambell, right, instead of coming out to vote in 1964 . Labour leader Harold Wilson, centre, approached the BBC directly to delay the show's repeat broadcast . So he approached Sir Hugh at his home to express his concerns over the broadcast. The BBC is releasing an archive interview with Sir Hugh recorded in 1982 as well as a 1981 interview with the former Prime Minister. The joint project between the BBC and the University of Sussex, which is being published today, shows the corporation's involvement in elections since 1922. According to Sir Hugh's 1982 interview: 'He came around to have a drink. He had been very much upset because the BBC had planned the beginning of a series of repeats of a very popular light entertainment programme, Steptoe and Son, on the evening of polling day. He thought that would keep away particularly Labour supporters from the polls.' At the peak of the show's popularity, some 28 million people tuned in. Sir Hugh continued: 'Harold Wilson that evening began by accusing the BBC of plotting against him. I told him that he must really know in his heart of hearts that that was untrue, and unless he withdrew that remark there was no point in our discussing anything. We could just have a drink and that could be that. 'He did withdraw and we talked about the Steptoe and Son problem. The next day I discussed the matter further with the controller of BBC One and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock, when at that time the polls closed. 'I rang up Harold Wilson and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him. 'He won, I think, by four, and I've sometimes wondered what effect my decision had on British political history.' Former BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene, pictured, said Mr Wilson feared broadcasting Steptoe and Son on the 1964 election night could end up costing the Labour Party 20 seats - they won the election by four . Mr Wilson also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive. He said: 'Polling then ended at nine o'clock and a lot of our people - my people, working in Liverpool, long journey out, perhaps then a high tea and so on, it was getting late, especially if they wanted to have a pint first.

        "article": "A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces.\u00a0The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits -\u00a0are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats . A masked fighter in black (right) brandishing a pistol vows to kill Christians if they do not convert, saying: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again' The victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants (above) before being shot at point-blank range simultaneously. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group . The militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip . Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century, making it\u00a0one of the oldest Christian states in the world. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest organized Christian bodies in the world, and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church. Around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of Christianity, a majority being Protestant. Islam was not introduced in the country for another 300 years, and now about one third of Ethiopians identify as Muslim. Initial reports did not make clear who the captives were or when they were captured. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group. Redwan Hussein, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity. He said he believed those killed were likely to have been Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe. Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives. 'If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route,' Mr Hussein said. He added that Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Libya, would help repatriate Ethiopians if they wanted to leave.\u00a0Libyan officials were not immediately available for comment. Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, said he also believed the victims  were likely to have been migrants. 'I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous,' he said. 'No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion.' Ethiopia's options to retaliate remain slim, given its distance from Libya. However, Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt Mohammed Edrees said his country could partner with Cairo to strike the militants. 'That could be an option,' Mr Edrees said. 'We will see and explore what is possible to deal with group.' It comes just two months after the extremist group in Libya beheaded 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a beach (above) The latest video mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach (pictured above), which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya . Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate for the Middle East Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'The Islamic State in Libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high-profile executions. But they face some structural limits in terms of how much local support they can get because they haven't captured real revenue streams.' It comes just two months after IS militants  filmed themselves beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a similar beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya. ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The group is also advancing in Iraq, where it has captured three villages near the city of Ramadi. Islamic State fighters, pictured carrying flags and dressed in black, have been able to gain a foothold amid the chaos in Libya . More than 90,000 people have fled the ISIS's advance in Anbar, a United Nations humanitarian agency said earlier this morning. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said: 'Our top priority is delivering life-saving assistance to people who are fleeing - food, water and shelter are highest on the list of priorities.' Iraqi officials in Anbar have described Ramadi as a ghost town, with empty streets and closed shops. Iraqi troops backed by Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes managed to dislodge ISIS, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East, from the northern city of Tikrit earlier this month. But the troops have struggled against the militants in Anbar, which saw some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S. military intervention that ended in 2011. Elsewhere today, the US-led\u00a0coalition said Kurdish forces recaptured 11 villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province from ISIS following days of intense clashes. The coalition said the area of about 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) was south of the city of Kirkuk.",

        "article": "As a new fashion designer, cementing a place in the market can be tough ground work. Of course, a few celebrity\u00a0endorsements\u00a0and a business partner with a little black book packed with A-list\u00a0contacts\u00a0doesn't hurt. Kylie Gulliver, a former model and actress (with appearances on\u00a0Neighbours, Offspring and Winners and Losers on her resume) from Melbourne had been toiling away at her small leather brand for three years, before a very modern encounter - via Instagram - changed her fortune. The 29-year-old's brand Elliott Label is suddenly the hit of Hollywood, and is adorning the backs of stars including\u00a0Kourtney Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and pop group GRL. Scroll down for video . Elliott entourage: Melbourne brand 'Elliott Label' is hitting the big time in Hollywood with Drew Barrymore a fan . Power of the Kardashians: Kourtney (pictured above) wore an Elliott leather cap and \u00a0the brand sky-rocketed . The recent projection into the big time comes with the addition of Robin Antin - dancer, choreographer and founder of The Pussycat Dolls and GRL - as Kylie's business partner. Gulliver admits that since Antin has come on board the brand has sky rocketed from being a 'small solely-owned start up' to a complete lifestyle brand that's reaching a mass market across Australia, the US, UK, Norway and Israel. The two met in what is fast becoming the 21st century norm - through Instagram. Antin, 50, initially contacted Gulliver to request samples for her pop group, GRL, and\u00a0the rest is history. Doll to duo: Robin Antin, founder of The Pussycat Dolls has now joined with Gulliver as partner to Elliott Label . Aussie A-Listers: Mimie Elashiry is one of the brands biggest supporters and currently models for the brand . Luxe leather: Mimie models on the label's website - pictured wearing the Leather Puffer Vest, US$999 (left), and Desert Leather Tank US$239 (right) 'When we  finally met up for the first time, we got along so well it felt like we'd known each other for years,' Gulliver told Daily Mail over the phone from Los Angeles. 'But it wasn't until I came over to visit her in to LA - we'd been throwing around the idea of launching a lingerie brand, but then I saw her insane jacket collection, and I said: \"screw the lingerie line, come in on Eliot label\".' According to Gulliver, it was one of the best decisions she could have made. 'My biggest regret originally was that I didn't start the label with someone, and so when Robin and I decided to work together I finally had someone to do the whole process with me'. And lend her little black book of Hollywood contacts too. Antin who counts Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz as close friends, and has a wide network of A-listers she has been able to give items from the collection to. Charlie's Angels: Robin Antin and Drew Barrymore became friends on the set of Charlie's Angels 2 . Close with Cameron: Robin Antin wears Elliott  puffer vest after dance class with Cameron Diaz . Friendship on film: Robin first struck up a friendship with Drew and Cameron when The Pussycat Dolls featured in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . At their recent Elliott Label launch in LA, Barrymore made a red carpet appearance to support the duo. According to Antin, the two share a long history together since early days when Barrymore first spotted The Pussycat Dolls and roped them into starring in Charlie's Angels 2. Barrymore's favourite pieces from their label are said to include the a leather blazer (the one seen worn by Antin at their launch) and a motorcycle vest with a hood. Smouldering: The Moto jacket from Elliott Label collection costs US$750 from the website . High-end: Biker Shorts cost $389, and the silk shirt is $289 . Thousand dollar pants: These leather Biker Pants cost $999 . Diaz, not one to miss out either, also received 'a big bag of goodies' from Antin, 'who took them over to her house and dumped on her couch' and was suitably delighted. The girls know the power of celebrity endorsements, and reveal that  the 2013 paparazzi shots of Kourtney Kardashian wearing a Elliott leather cap was a massive boost despite it happening 'organically.' As is the power of their stockists, such as 'Kyle,' one of the busiest boutiques in Beverly Hills which happens to be owned by Kyle Richards of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' fame (she is also the aunt of Nicky and Paris Hilton). Eclectic resume: Kylie, 29, from Melbourne, was previously a model and actress, before starting her own label . Yet aside from the big name stars showing their support,  Antin also has a long history in clothing design, with a family history of seamstresses. In the early days of The Pussycat Dolls she would also make the original costumes by hand. 'When  Pussycat Dolls began, I made every costume. So when Kylie came to America and we went through my closet and I showed her everything I had re-done and tailored my way (even clothing by Yves Saint Laurent) it was the perfect marriage.' Of the brand itself, Gulliver says Elliott Label is bold, edgy and has attitude that comes with classic and timeless pieces for the every day girl. 'My aim is to steal a place in the market for well tailored, classic, quality material items at a good price point,' says Gulliver. She likens the label to  Rag and Bone and Alexander Wang - \u00a0but with an Australian influence. Gulliver reveals that Elliot Label was originally born out of a period of feeling 'lost' and lacking direction, and so the label became her new motivation. Lady in leather: Gulliver wearing Elliott Label at the Kyle boutique in Beverly Hills . Lost to leather label: Gulliver admits her inspiration for starting Elliott was after a 'lost' period in her life . 'For me it was a lifestyle choice starting the label, I was in a \u2018place\u2019 when I started it, I thought, you can talk about it or whinge about life or you can just do it,' says Gulliver. 'I wasn't enjoying what I was doing anymore and when I was  on a holiday in Indonesia  there was only so much tanning I could do then I noticed all the tannery places in Indonesia and that's when the idea came to me.' Now those restless, tanning days are long behind her, the question is how is she adapting to the non-stop business life of a business owner? 'It's stressful at times, the production side of things, language barriers et cetera, but while it's busy and hectic but I do have a work life balance and I'm doing something I love that is rewarding,' she says. Melbourne model to LA label: Kylie Gulliver has grown Elliott Label from small start-up to LA lifestyle brand . So what's next for the leather label? A vegan leather line is their newest addition, which, according to Antin, is already gaining massive 'street cred' amongst the fashion scene in LA. 'I've been walking around in the non leather puffer vest and people are like where did you get that? And I say, \"It's our line\". Then there's  a sport luxe line in collaboration with the pre-existing Pussycat Doll's label. 'We are in the developing stage of sport luxe line, Pussycat Dolls sport. So it will come under the PussyCat Dolls name, but under the Eliott umbrella with Pussycat dolls as inspiration for the collection,' says Antin. The Elliot Label 'Sport luxe' range is hoped to be out for the US summer, as The Pussycat Dolls Vegas shows begin soon and they plan to style the group for the show season. Fashion vs Fallon: Antin and Gulliver  rub shoulder with stars such as Jimmy Fallon (pictured middle) Gulliver has also started consulting as a social media guru for their new joint venture - social media advisory brand - 'Trendsetters.' 'Kylie comes from incredible social media background and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do the business or have met if it wasn't through social media,' says Antin. It seems, the sky is the limit for the growing fashion designer duo, with Antin even hoping for a brand collaboration in the future - 'Look how Tom Ford got started - Kylie and I are just as talented, we have the business sense and creativity to do that, exciting for what future holds for designers and young brand.' As for the lingerie brand they originally planned to do? \u2018Oh my god, yes we probably will!\u2019 Right now we're focusing on Elliot Label, but Robin and I are crazy so we might turn around in six months and say it\u2019s time for that lingerie line and we\u2019ll do it,' says Gulliver.",

        "article": "London (CNN)The Hatton Garden heist, as it will surely come to be known, was every safe deposit box holder's nightmare, every movie director's dream. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a \"slow and painstaking\" forensic examination, police said in a statement. \"Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,\" the statement said. \"At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified.\" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. \"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,\" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken. The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\" Robbers target security vans in France jewel heist .",

        "article": "An alcohol-fuelled 14-year-old boy killed a father-of-two in an unprovoked street attack after wishing him 'Happy New Year'. Kyle Major, from Blackpool, Lancashire, followed his victim - who had just asked his group of friends for directions - and felled him from behind with a punch to the back of the head. Paul Walker, 52, was thought to be unconscious before his chin hit the ground and died shortly afterwards in hospital. Kyle Major, 14, punched father-of-two Paul Walker (right) in the back of the head after wishing him a happy New Year. The court heard the boy had been 'allowed to run wild' The court heard how he had been found face down in a pool of blood\u00a0by a passerby in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day this year, and that his hands were still in his pockets when paramedics arrived. Sentenced at Preston Crown Court today, Major, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing, was ordered to be detained for three years. The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the juvenile following an application that the public interest in identifying him outweighed the child\u2019s welfare. Teenager Kyle Major cowardly killed father of two Paul Walker in the early hours of New Year's Day . Major followed his victim who had just asked his group of friends for directions and felled him from behind with a single punch to the back of the head. The court heard that Mr Walker, described by his family as 'a lovely man with a big heart', had lost his way in the resort after leaving his sister\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party 'in good spirits'. He came across a group of youths in the street in Sutton Place who told him where he was, including Major who was heard to wish him 'Happy New Year'. Moments later the defendant and a male friend followed Mr Walker. Major ran off after felling Mr Walker and later texted another friend: 'I\u2019m scared. Don\u2019t want to go to jail. Two/four years. Don\u2019t say anything.' He initially denied any involvement in the attack when arrested. Mr Walker was described by his family in the court room as a 'lovely man with a big heart' The court heard that Major, of Devonshire Road, had consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night. He regularly drank to excess and was also an habitual user of cannabis. The teenager already had seven previous convictions for non-violent offences such as burglary and theft. Major consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night . Major regularly drank to excess, smoked cannabis, was in foster care and had seven previous convictions . He had been under the supervision of a youth offending team since December 2013 following various court orders but his response was said to have been \u201cpoor\u201d and he was described in reports as acting in 'a reckless and carefree manner' with no regard to the consequences to himself or others. Currently in foster care, Major\u2019s parenting was said to be 'out-of-control'. Judge Russell said that Mr Walker had been 'vulnerable' and possibly unsteady on his feet. 'The blow was of significant force to knock a large man down. You had no thought for what you were doing at the time. 'You have a criminal record and you have shown until this matter came to light no inclination to mend your ways or respond positively. 'You were responsible for the loss of this decent man, a loss for which the family will never recover. Your upbringing has been unfortunate and you have been allowed to run wild.'",

        "article": "A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and\u00a0a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The \u00a344m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial \u00a3120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'",

        "article": "It's probable that Thiago Alcantara would never have signed for Manchester United even if David Moyes had wanted him. Once Pep Guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at Bayern Munich, it was pointless for United to continue their pursuit anyway, . But the fact that Moyes wasn't keen on the transfer - 'not his type' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he wasn't the right fit for United. Not that Moyes is a bad judge of a player; all managers get it wrong at some point. However, United's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout Moyes' short time at the club. Indeed, it has continued to be a problem until Michael Carrick fully recovered from injury and Ander Herrera began to find his feet. The kind of passing display Thiago delivered in Bayern's 6-1 win over Porto on Wednesday has been precisely what United have been missing. Thiago (right) heads in Bayern Munich's first goal during their 6-1 win over Porto on Tuesday night . Thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started Bayern's remarkable comeback . Thiago is congratulated on his strike by Pep Guardiola, the man who took him from Barcelona to Bayern . Without quality in that area, few teams can compete at the elite level any more. It used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height, strength and an ability to tackle. Given that most distribution emanates from deep, being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now. Moyes might quite reasonably been worried that Thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. And his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by Spain at the World Cup after pulling out with a knee injury. But there are few players in the world who can pass like Thiago. Gary Neville has spoken about how Paul Scholes was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing. Andrea Pirlo and Xavi are two more from Scholes' generation. Thiago is now elevating himself to their level. One experienced German journalist who has been watching Bayern for 35 years commented last night: 'Thiago might well be the most technically-gifted central midfielder who has ever played for Bayern.' Thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for Bayern Munich as they crushed Porto . Thiago started his career at Barcelona but was overlooked for Cesc Fabregas (right) by boss Tito Vilanova . And no-one has invested more in Thiago than Guardiola, which is why United had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made. It was Pep who promoted him to the first team at Barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad. But when Pep left, his successor, the late Tito Vilanova, wanted Cesc Fabregas to play that role. Thiago was sidelined, hence his availability in the summer of 2013. He is very much a global footballer for the 21st century. His dad, of course, is Brazilian, the World Cup winner Mazinho; Thiago was born in Italy and raised in Spain. He opted to play for the country in which he was living, rather than that of his forefathers or his birth, and was outstanding for Spain in the European Under 21 championships in 2013, scoring a hat-trick in the final against Italy in a 4-2 win. At Barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of Thiago. Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets have that position covered. But Xavi is off to Qatar and Cesc is at Chelsea. Should Barca end up against Bayern in the Champions League semi finals, they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements. David Moyes believed Thiago may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League .",

Sally White, 28, rescued the terrified animal from a bleak hillside where he was abandoned without food and water. His ribs were poking through and vets feared he would not survive more than a few days. But Sally's love and care for the skinny and mistreated horse has turned it into a magnificent steed - and the pair have become inseparable. A stunning bride rode to her wedding on the horse she saved from dying of starvation . Sally White, 28, rescued the terrified animal from a bleak hillside where he was abandoned without food and water . When Sally married surveyor Mark White. 30, she wanted the horse called Miller to play a part in her wedding celebrations. Sally said: 'Miller and I are a team - I needed him with me on my big day. 'I rode him to church and I even had a model of Miller on my wedding cake. 'It was touch and go whether he would survive when he was rescued by the RSPCA three years ago. 'But just look at him now - he's magnificent.' When Sally married surveyor Mark White. 30, she wanted the horse called Miller to play a part in her wedding celebrations . She says:\u00a0'I rode him to church and I even had a model of Miller on my wedding cake,' The RSPCA were called in to rescue the 15.2 hands cob abandoned in a field in Swansea, South Wales, three years ago . Sally's dramatic entrance at the church was slightly ruined when it poured with rain - putting a dampener on the wedding pictures. So she put her white wedding gown on again a week later and brought in a specialist equine photographer to take the stunning snaps which she will treasure forever. The RSPCA were called in to rescue the 15.2 hands cob abandoned in a field in Swansea, South Wales, three years ago. He was malnourished, had severe anaemia and struggled to stand up because he was so weak. Miller was taken to the RSPCA's Gonsal Farm Equine Welfare and Rehabilitation Centre in Shrewsbury where Sally works as a groom - and it was love at first sight. Sally said: 'He was in a terrible state after being abandoned in a field with no water and only brambles to eat. When Sally first found Miller his ribs were poking through and vets feared he would not survive more than a few days . 'I adopted him and after a lot of tender love and care he put his weight back on and turned out to be a very good pupil.' Sally trained the six-year-old horse in the arts of dressage and she now competes with him in the British championships. She said: 'He took to dressage straight away - he's won lots of rosettes and everywhere he goes people love him. He's become a real star. 'He was on his best behaviour for my wedding day and when we took the photographs later he just looked perfect. I felt very proud.' The RSPCA hope Miller's story will encourage others to adopt mistreated horses, ponies and donkeys. Gareth Johnson, the RSPCA's equine rehoming officer for Wales, said: 'Sally has worked hard with Miller and his transformation has been fantastic. 'I am delighted that he has been given a completely new life with Sally and it is lovely to see them both together.'",

Mario Ambarita, 21, took chances with his life when he clambered into the wheel housing of the Garuda Indonesia flight which took off from the main island of Sumatra and flew at 34,000ft to Jakarta. The desperate reason for his actions was simply that he was \u2018looking for work\u2019. Mario Ambarita, pictured, clambered into the wheel housing of the Garuda Indonesia flight which took off from the main island of Sumatra and flew at 34,000ft to Jakarta . He had climbed into the wheel housing when the aircraft stopped at the end of the runway in Pekan Baru, Sumatra, during a scheduled touch down to pick up passengers. The Indonesian news organisation, Kompas, reported that Mr Ambarita was in a dazed state when he crawled out of the wheel housing at Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta airport. Ground staff stared in amazement as the young man started staggering away from the aircraft before he was grabbed by security officials. His immediate whereabouts were unknown this morning. His mother, Tiar Sitanggan, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that she had \u2018no idea\u2019 her son was planning to go to Jakarta. The 21-year-old climbed into the wheel housing when Garuda Indonesia plane stopped at the end of the runway in Pekan Baru, Sumatra, during a scheduled touch down to pick up passengers (file picture) She said he had left home in the town of Bagan Batu to look for work in Pekan Baru, which is also on Sumatra island. \u2018He left last month and I hadn\u2019t heard from him since,\u2019 she said. She only found about his exploits when she saw him on MetroTV news. Mr Pesman Pujabroto, a spokesman for Garuda, said Mr Ambarita \u2018knew the plane would stop\u2019 after it taxied to the end of the runway at Pekan Baru. It was then that he seized the opportunity to smuggle himself into the wheel housing. The air temperature was well below freezing and experts said the stowaway had only managed to survive because of the relatively short flight. An airline spokesman said Mr Ambarita was suffering from the effects of the cold and lack of oxygen when he stumbled out of the wheel well. Mr Ambarita was in a dazed state when he crawled out of the wheel housing at Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta airport (shown in this file picture) \u2018He looked lacking of oxygen,\u2019 said the airline\u2019s communication secretary, Pujobroto ,who like many Indonesians uses only one name. \u2018His fingers turned blue and his left ear was bleeding.\u2019 Garuda\u2019s ground crew immediately helped him to the airport\u2019s clinic where last night he was received treatment. It was expected he would be transferred to a hospital later. Mr Pujobroto said the maximum cruising altitude of that particular flight was 34,000ft, far above the 16,000ft threshold where the air temperature drops to freezing. The young man\u2019s relatives said that since a child he had dreamed of visiting Jakarta. It was learned that for the past 10 days he had kept the Pekan Baru airport under watch after learning how to sneak into a plane's wheel housing from the Internet. He had also worked out how to reach the aircraft by clambering over a security fence.",

It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger\u2019s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard\u2019s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager\u2019s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season\u2019s standout player for \u00a332million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for \u00a332million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out . Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house . Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille . That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: \u2018I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And (I could) not defend it, honestly. \u2018It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.\u2019 Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday\u2019s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal\u2019s Alexis Sanchez. He said: \u2018It\u2019s very close. Let\u2019s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn\u2019t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. \u2018I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. \u2018He can turn games when it\u2019s 0-0 and when it\u2019s tight. That\u2019s always a sign of top quality.\u2019 Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez (centre) will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote . Chelsea fans reach out to their star man during last weekend's win against Manchester United .",

        "article": "London (CNN)Police said Thursday that there was no sign of forced entry to a building in a spectacular holiday weekend heist of safe deposit boxes in the heart of London's jewelry district. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. Johnson said he had no figure for the value of what was stolen. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds, or 300 million dollars, in a remark widely reported by news media. And numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. But Johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving them in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. Over the four-day Easter holiday, an unknown number of thieves broke into the vault and might have been able to take as much as four days to rifle through the boxes. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the UK capable of having pulled it off. He said had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway? The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\"",

        "article": "John Hartson was once on the end of a major Hampden injustice while playing for Celtic - but he cannot see any point in his old club writing to the Scottish Football Association over the latest controversy at the national stadium. Celtic issued a statement on Monday evening revealing they were 'seeking an understanding' of the failure to penalise Inverness defender Josh Meekings for stopping a goal-bound Leigh Griffiths header with his hand. Celtic were leading 1-0 at the time but went on to lose 3-2 and some fans have questioned how referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir could have missed the infringement. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Kris Commons of Celtic appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty before Celtic crash out . John Hartson, pictured at golf charity event, has urged his former club to move on from the injustice . Hartson had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside while Celtic were 2-1 down in an Old Firm League Cup final and the Welshman went on to miss a last-minute penalty that could have sparked extra-time. But he refused to dwell on the match officials' error - and called on Celtic to move on from the latest setback rather than writing letters. 'I'm not sure what sort of purpose it's going to serve,' said Hartson as he launched a 'Know Your Balls' testicular cancer awareness drive at his charity's annual golf day at Mar Hall in Bishopton. 'It has happened before and will happen again. There's a lot of disappointment at Celtic and rightly so, it should have been a penalty. David Raven (2nd right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring the late winner in 3-2 victory . Celtic pair Aleksandar Tonev (left) and John Guidetti look dejected as their hopes of a domestic treble end . 'I think the referee just missed it. When you are questioning people's integrity and honesty, that can sometimes go a little overboard. The referee just missed a decision, I'm sure if he'd seen it he would have given it. 'It happened to me in 2003 when I scored a legitimate goal against Rangers at Hampden Park in a cup final. It was proven to be two yards onside and it got called offside. It was a big moment for me. 'I was disappointed for two days and I got over it, and I think Celtic will get over it. 'They feel they have a right to complain, and that's what they want to do, but I'm not too sure what they are going to gain by it.' Hartson believes Ronny Deila can still class his first season as Celtic manager a success if they go on to clinch the Scottish Premiership title - they can move eight points clear of Aberdeen by beating Dundee at Dens Park on Wednesday. 'I think they will never get a better opportunity to win the treble,' the former Wales striker said. 'They got the League Cup final in the bag and they could have played a Championship team (Falkirk) in the final. Celtic manager Ronny Deila has criticised an official's decisions during Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness . 'So it's a missed opportunity but I think if you had offered a chance to win a double to a young rookie manager who had not managed anywhere near this level, a lot of people didn't know who he was, I think he would have taken that. 'When he sits in the summer and has a moment to himself he will probably realise it has been a successful season, tinged with disappointment because he has not joined great managers like Jock Stein and Martin O'Neill. 'Obviously they have a little work to do to get over the line but they should win the league and they should be fairly pleased.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Prison life won't be pretty for Aaron Hernandez, the former NFL player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole. After correction officers evaluate him, he will be shipped to Massachusetts' flagship maximum-security prison, one of the most high-tech jails in the United States with no history of breakouts: the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, about 40 miles outside downtown Boston. It's called Souza, for short, and it's the state's newest prison, opened in 1998, with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire. \"I don't know the date, but he'll be going there. That's the maximum-security facility,\" Department of Corrections spokesman Darren Duarte said. Legal advocates for inmates describe Souza as sterile and violent at once. Its diverse demographic includes the young and the old, many of whom are also doing life. One stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates, the legal advocates said. \"It's very shiny and clean looking and very sterile,\" said Leslie Walker, executive director of Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, who has been visiting the Souza prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there. But, she added: \"It is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates.\" Officials said Hernandez, 25, is being processed at the maximum-security Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Cedar Junction in Walpole, just a handful of miles from Gillette Stadium, where he once played tight end for the New England Patriots under a five-year $40 million contract. The prison system has yet to determine where to initially place Hernandez in Souza: solitary confinement; the less harsh but restricted block; the general population; a privileged section known as the \"lifers block,\" for those serving a life sentence; or the \"kitchen block,\" for those who work in the prison kitchen. \"At this point in time, we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of Hernandez is complete,\" Duarte said. \"Right now, he'll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door, but they will figure all that out.\" Hernandez was sent immediately for processing after Wednesday's sentencing and jury conviction, Duarte said. A news outlet helicopter followed Hernandez's transfer to MCI Cedar Junction. Prison officials will be concerned about Hernandez's safety and whether any enemies, gangs or headline-seeking inmates will try to hurt Hernandez, who will become Souza's most famous resident. \"There could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him,\" Walker said. \"Then he's going to have to be separated, and it's going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him. \"The good news is that the superintendent of Souza-Baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being, who I'm sure will do everything he can to keep Mr. Hernandez safe,\" Walker added. \"The person at the top sets the tone. He's fairly new and he's doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible.\" That superintendent, Osvaldo Vidal, couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. Because of his celebrity, Hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards, said Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high- and minimum-security prisons. \"There will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is, but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star,\" said Levine, who founded Wall Street Prison Consultants, which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison. In the long run, however, it may not matter much in what section of the prison Hernandez does his time. About 90% of the inmates in the maximum-security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day, said Walker, the legal advocate. \"It's pretty grim,\" Walker said. Souza has slightly larger cells than most other Massachusetts prisons, but not by much, Walker said. Even so, the cells are stark, small rooms of painted cinder-block walls with metal fixtures: a bunk mounted to the wall, a toilet and sink combination, a small writing shelf attached to the wall, and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor, Walker said. There's also a shelf for a small television, which must have a clear back for easy inspection, Walker said. With the exception of the TV, which inmates can buy for under $200, all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them, she said. There are two windows: one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall, building or trees, and a tiny window on the cell door, which has two slots, for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door, she said. \"There's very little to do,\" Walker said of inmate life. \"It was built as a punishment facility. The thing in corrections is that you don't want people to like it there. Some people have been there since it opened, and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both.\" To combat opiate use among inmates, prison guards use narcotics-sniffing dogs for inspections, Walker said. \"It's pretty pathetic. I have clients (in Souza prison) who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean,\" Walker said. There also are gangs in the prison, she said. As for violence, one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year, Walker said. If Hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement, it won't be pleasant, Walker said. \"Solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in. The lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad,\" Walker said. Initially, \"prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety, but I hope not,\" Walker said. \"It's very hard time.\" Opinion: The shame of Aaron Hernandez .",

An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a\u00a0poor\u00a0decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence.

Mother-of-two Lindsey Norman noticed the uncanny resemblance in a six pack of \u00a31 buns she had purchased from her local Sainsbury's in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Scroll down for video . Mother of two Lindsey Norman spotted the image of Jesus in the hot cross buns she bought from Sainsbury's . She said: 'I saw them and thought \"that looks just like a figure of Jesus with a sign of the cross on his shoulder\". 'It made me giggle to myself because it's coming up to Easter.' Ms Norman purchased the buns from the store and took them home for dinner that evening. She has since eaten all the buns in the packet. The shop assistant said it made me 'giggle' when she saw the uncanny resemblance with Easter coming up . This is not the first time the Saviour has been spotted in a peculiar sighting. Last week a California couple were shocked by the 'miraculous' appearance of Jesus on their pine dining table. Jaimie Beebe, 37, and her boyfriend Gary Ousdahl, 37, put the table on eBay with a $5,000 (\u00a33,350) price tag - but it has yet to receive any bids. In the same week, hundreds of believers flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, when a landslide revealed the face of Jesus. Police had to be called in to control the crowds as Christians from across the country descended on the hill to witness the 'miracle'. In January last year, stunned dog owner Rachel Evans, 25, was bathing her mini Yorkshire terrier Dave in the bathroom sink when she spotted the image of Jesus in his ear. And in October, John Cranfield, 24, who lives in Manchester, inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of Jesus Christ. Mr Cranfield, a Catholic, said he was sure it is a message from God, adding: \u2018As a strong Christian I believe that this was no mistake, I believe that God himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that I should not give up my faith.\u2019",

        "article": "It is the radio format that has delivered the latest chart hits, news and talk shows in stereo to homes around the world for decades. But now the characteristic hiss of interference that accompanies most FM broadcasts is set to fall silent. Norway has announced that it will be the the first country in the world to switch off its FM radio signal. Twiddling the knobs of a radio will no longer be necessary  as analogue services switch off in favour of digital . The Norwegian Government said it will turn off its FM transmitters on January 11 2017. Now with the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio, it seems likely other countries will follow Norway's example. The UK had planned to switch off its own FM service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations. It is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations. Streaming has topped CD sales in revenue for the first time in the United States as music listeners flock to on-demand services and Internet radio, industry figures showed. Data for 2014 showed a major shift to streaming as opposed to physical sales and permanent downloads, with rapid growth both for on-demand services such as Spotify and Rhapsody and Internet radio providers such as Pandora. Streaming revenue totaled $1.87 billion, edging out the $1.85 billion earned by CD sales, according to data of the Recording Industry Association of America. Streaming helped stabilize the bottom line for the long-troubled industry, with overall revenue from recorded music going up two percent to $4.86 billion to mark the fourth year of growth. Listening figures currently show that digital radios account for 37.9% of all listening hours in the UK. In the US, around 85% of American adults still listen to AM/FM stations. Norway, however, has just five national FM broadcasting outlets while there are 22 national digital radio stations. The Norwegian government said there was space for a further 20 digital radio stations and NRK, Norway's public service broadcaster, will be the first to switch off its FM service. The Norwegian Ministry of Culture estimates that the switch to digital radio could save \u00a317 million a year (NOK 200 million). Thorhild Widvey, the country's minister of culture, said: 'Radio digitisation will open the door to a far greater range of radio channels, benefiting listeners across the country. 'Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality. 'Digitisation will also greatly improve the emergency preparedness system, facilitate increased competition and offer new opportunities for innovation and development. Digital radios, like  above, might look retro but can give listeners access to more stations than ever before . Growing numbers of car stereos now come with digital radio as standard, leading to a drop in FM listeners . 'More than half the population already has access to local radio on DAB, and there is considerable potential for further local channels.' The switch off of FM services could create other problems - leaving millions of households with legacy electronics unable to pick up a signal. FM radio, which was first invented in 1933, transmits information by modulating the frequency of the carrier wave. This produces a high quality analogue signal that travels over short distances but can be prone to interference. FM radio became the popular way to transmit stereo broadcasts and it also became hugely popular with pirate radio stations. Digital radio by comparison uses digital modulation - compressing the audio signal into a specific bandwidth spectrum. This allows more radio stations to be crammed into the bandwidth space and can produce clearer reception.",

Ambrose, who terrorised many a batsman during the 1990s, looked to have roused his charges as they took five for 58 in the morning session. But Alastair Cook and Co will be happy to see the big man beyond the boundary rope rather than thundering down the wicket towards them himself. Curtly Ambrose's pep talk to West Indies bowlers must have worked on day two as they rolled over the tail . Battling Jordan . England\u2019s ninth man in Chris Jordan played out an interesting duel with former Barbados team-mate Justin Holder - a close-fought battle which yielded nine runs from 27 balls, including two boundaries. Aside from Jordan\u2019s knock and Anderson\u2019s quickfire 20, England\u2019s tail suffered a torrid morning \u2014 they began the day on 341 for five and were all out for 399 by lunch.

Shiv Chanderpaul's Test career for the West Indies has lasted over 21 years . Confusing review . The Decision Review System at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium caused prolonged confusion on Tuesday. Umpire Billy Bowden was unmoved by protests after Jordan was struck on the knee-roll by Holder, so the decision was reviewed. Without Hot Spot or Snicko, the third umpire spent a few minutes examining the replay before deciding Jordan had the finest of edges \u2014 only for the ball-tracker graphic to finally appear and show it was completely missing the stumps. KP worry . Kevin Pietersen had an injury scare when he was struck on the right hand while fielding at leg slip and fell to the ground.

Research has revealed that three out of four people have little or no knowledge about the Battle of Waterloo. Only just over half (53 per cent) know the Duke of Wellington led the British forces, while one in seven believe that it was the French who were victorious in 1815. Veeker's rendering of the battle between\u00a0Wellington's Anglo-Dutch army and the French:\u00a0Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know who led British forces against France in the battle . The survey, by the National Army Museum ahead of the 200th anniversary on June 18, also showed that young people are more likely to associate Waterloo with the London railway station or the Abba song than the actual battle \u2013 with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of it. Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know, or they thought the man in charge was either Sir Francis Drake, Sir Winston Churchill, King Arthur or even Harry Potter's wizardry mentor Albus Dumbledore. More than a quarter of all the people polled (28 per cent) have no idea who won the Battle of Waterloo, while one in seven (14 per cent) wrongly believe the French were victorious over the British. Two-thirds (67 per cent) are unaware that June 18th this year is the bicentenary of Waterloo. Now the National Army Museum, together with Waterloo 200 - the organisation approved by the government to support the anniversary - and other cultural organisations, are planning a series of events to bring Waterloo to life . Janice Murray, Director-General at the National Army Museum, said: 'Despite the Battle of Waterloo being an iconic moment in British history, UK public awareness is dramatically low. 'The National Army Museum is seeking to bridge this knowledge gap through the creation of a series of innovative pop-up events and regional exhibitions around the country making the dramatic story of the battle accessible for all.'

Young people were also likely to associate the battle with the London Station,\u00a0with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of the battle . The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18th, 1815, when British and Prussian forces, under the command of Duke of Wellington, halted the advance of French Army in Belgium. The bloody battle claimed the lives of 65,000 of the 200,000 men that took part, and saw the defeat of Napoleon, ending his reign as Emperor of France and ushering in a period of peace following years of war in Europe. The National Army Museum, based in Chelsea, west London, is currently closed for redevelopment. It is due to reopen next year .",

Matthew Connolly has only been at the club for a month but struck a goal that proved key at a stadium that has humbled all three of their nearest promotion rivals.

Referee: Paul Tierney 6.5 . Attendance: 20,723 . An automatic return to the top-flight for the first time since 2007 remains on. Watford entered this match knowing only a victory would do in their pursuit of automatic promotion. Bournemouth, Norwich and Middlesbrough all won on Tuesday night to maintain the pace at the head of this increasingly intriguing race for Premier League gold. Aware of the circumstances, Heurelho Gomes was alert from the off. Just 56 seconds were on the clock when the Brazilian goalkeeper stopped a certain goal. Chris Burke, found by Michail Antonio, drove a shot from close range but Gomes saved with his legs. Three minutes later, the visitors went ahead. Craig Cathcart flicked on Almen Adbi\u2019s corner allowing Odion Ighalo to nod in at the far post. It was the Nigerian\u2019s 20th Championship goal in a stellar debut season. The noise from the packed away section of 1,942 gave an impression of its significance. But this was never going to be one-way traffic. Forest have beaten Bournemouth and Boro here under Dougie Freedman, as well as Norwich when Stuart Pearce was in charge, and threatened repeatedly. In the 15th minute Antonio drew a fine save from Gomes with a strike from range, then Ben Osborn hit one that required all of the Watford No 1\u2019s 6ft 3in frame to palm wide. By the end of the first half Gomes had made seven saves of varying quality. His most eye-catching stop came in the 39th minute when left-back Eric Lichaj caught a falling ball ever so sweetly on the volley.

Golascorer Connolly gets rid of any danger with an acrobatic clearance for the away side during the first half . Watford's remaining  fixtures: Birmingham (H), Brighton (A), Sheffield Wednesday (H) Watford\u2019s attacking threat is pronounced, of course. Troy Deeney, who had 20 Championship goals before kick-off, partnered Ighalo up front. Slavisa Jokanovic was able to leave Matej Vydra on the bench. The Watford manager would have preferred any of that trio to have the chance that came Abdi\u2019s way in the 23rd minute. Ighalo threaded a pass to set the Swiss international clean through but he almost had too much time to deliberate and only succeeded in poking his finish wide. The crowd let out a groan of disbelief. Abdi did better with a curling free-kick in the 34th minute but Karl Darlow was equal to it. The Forest goalkeeper did not do as well seven minutes later however, when Watford doubled their lead. Connolly strode forward from central defence and played in Ighalo, who was able to fire a shot to sting the palms of Darlow. As the ball fell loose Jack Hobbs\u2019 presence seemed to make Darlow hesitate and Connolly snuck in to prod home his first goal since March 2013. Forest wideman Antonio evades the challenge of Watford defender Craig Cathcart and races forward . Antonio and Marco Motta challenge for a loose ball during Wednesday night's Championship clash . After the break, each side had a clear chance before Kelvin Wilson was sent off. In the 47th minute Darlow dived to claw round the post Ikechi Anya\u2019s shot from Marco Motta\u2019s cross. Three minutes later Burke should have done better than slice high and wide when found in the area by Antonio\u2019s smart pull back from the byline. Wilson was sent for an early bath that he can stay in till next season by referee Paul Tierney on the hour mark. The Forest centre-back became embroiled in a row with Ighalo and appeared to kick out, sending the Watford striker to the floor. The three-match ban for violent conduct will end Wilson\u2019s campaign. Ighalo manages to stay on his feet under the challenge of Nottingham Forest centre back Hobbs . Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes rolls the ball out at the City Ground . Despite the deficit, Forest struck back 18 minute from time when Gary Gardner bent an expert free-kick from 25 yards in off the bar. Forest rallied further. Antonio was guilty of an astonishing miss five minutes from time, skewing wide from six yards after Gomes had saved from Gardner to leave the net unguarded. Two minutes later Watford made the win safe. Adlene Guedioura\u2019s 30-yard screamer was punched out by Darlow but collected by Abdi, who rifled in to the bottom corner from the edge of the box.",

Last year Hawaiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company. Inspired by ancient Hawaiian beliefs in the sacredness of the landscape, Dustin Wong, 31, has journeyed from the Arctic Circle to Australia, capturing moments where men and women are alone with the power and splendour of the natural world. This single bikini-clad woman stretches her curvaceous body while silhouetted against a spectacular Hawaiian sunset . Faced with the rapid destruction of habitats through pollution and overpopulation, the photographer hopes his images will inspire the viewer with awe at the intricate and diverse world we live in and encourage them to protect the planet. He writes on his website: 'I have a desire to experience the natural world and to let those feelings inspire me. Life on this planet is older than any of us can comprehend, and there is a beauty in that history and power. However, these days our natural spaces are being encroached upon by human development. A man gazes upon a whirl of stars in\u00a0the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the salt-covered land cracks into spectacular patterns . Last year Hawiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company . 'Through my images I try to convey a sense of awe of the incredibly intricate and diverse world we share. I want to encourage people to interact and experience nature for themselves. I think this way more people will care about protecting and preserving natural environments.' He started taking photographs 15 years ago before taking it up full time last year. He traveled all over the west coast of the US living out of a van for five months and visited as many national parks as he could. In Queensland Australia, he follows a woman as she ventures into the dark depths of a natural cavern . His journeying in America took in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the land cracks into spectacular patterns, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the third largest hot spring in the world whose bright colours are caused by bacteria, to the Burning Man Festival in Nevada, which culminates in the burning of a wooden effigy. Other pictures show a spectacular Hawaiian sunset reflected in the sand in improbable bright oranges and reds, or a single solitary figure dwarfed by the waterfall surging above him at at Latourell Falls in Oregan. Revellers climb on top of a massive sculpture of the words 'Believe' at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada . For these photographs he also ventured to Australia, following a woman as she explores a cavern in Queensland, and to Norway, where he captures the stunning greens of the Northern Lights, or a firework exploding against a frosty night-time pine forest. Mr Wong takes his photographs using a DSLR camera before transforming them into High Dynamic Range to bring out colour and detail. He then blends the HDR image with the original exposures, creating an image that is 'slightly fantastical yet still rooted in reality'. The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, is the third largest hot spring in the world. Its bright colours are caused by pigmented bacteria . His images depict people interacting with the environment and enjoying themselves in the outdoors. At first he shunned using people in his images, which he wanted to capture nature at its pristine best, but he later realised a single figure - either a stranger or himself - provides a sense of scale and helps viewers relate more viscerally to the image in front of them. Although he now lives in Seattle in the USA, he credits his Hawaiian upbringing as the driving force behind his vision of the world. A single figure on a Norwegian beach is bathed in green light as he admires the spectacular Northern Light . He adds: 'Born and raised in Hawaii, I learned about the Hawaiian culture, specifically the way the Ancient Hawaiians held the land in reverence. Those teachings instilled in me an understanding that human beings have an intrinsic relationship with the land that should be held in high respect. 'I aim to create a sense of wonder in each of my pieces. I want to recapture the sense of awe and childhood imagination that often gets abandoned along the way to adulthood. I create art where the viewer is free to wallow in the mysteries and unknown of a beautiful landscape.' Standing in the middle of a snow-covered Norwegian pine forest, a couple release a firework, sending orange blazing into the sky . He uses a single figure like this man dwarfed by the water at Latourell Falls, Oregan, USA, to engourage a visceral response in viewers .",

        "article": "Creeping  through the Australian bush, Prince Harry proves he has lost none of his military skills on what are expected to be the last manoeuvres of his ten-year military career. With a Steyr assault rifle pulled tight into his shoulder, the Prince is pictured taking part in exercises with Royal Australian Artillery troops in Darwin. Harry\u2019s participation in the exercises follows his visit to the remote Kununurra region of Western Australia where he met village elders and children, camped in the Outback and was taught how to survive a bushfire. Scroll down for video . 'Delightful chap': Prince Harry takes time out from his tough training programme to play with local children at the Wuggubun community in a remote area hundreds of miles away from the nearest city, Darwin . As well as demonstrating his weapons handling and first aid skills, the 30-year-old took to the air in the Royal Australian Air Force\u2019s Tiger assault helicopter, which is similar to the Apache the Prince flew in combat sorties against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2012. At the end of the exercises in the Northern Territory, Prince Harry will hang up his fatigues and, after attending official functions in Perth and Sydney, is expected to return to Britain. In July, the Prince is scheduled to spend several weeks on a conservation project in Africa before finally deciding on a fulltime job, most probably in the charity or public service sectors. Harry may choose to continue his work with the MoD\u2019s Recovery Capability Programme, which helps wounded troops rebuild their lives and find new jobs. A source close to the Prince said his employment options were \u2018wide and varied\u2019 but he will not have to do Royal duties on a full-time basis. Put through his paces: The Prince patrols during Exercise Thunder Observer, a Joint Fire Team exercise with the 8th/12th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, at Robertson Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory . Bowing out: Prince Harry started his army career in 2005 when he began training at Sandhurst, and has completed two tours of Afghanistan . Harry, affectionately dubbed Captain Wales by his fellow soldiers, has completed the first two weeks of a month-long attachment with the Australian 1st Brigade - but he is due to leave the British military in June after 10 years' service . Harry has been participating in day-to-day soldiering activities and physical training sessions as well as undertaking flight simulation training. His itinerary also included time in an armed reconnaissance helicopter. After meeting with some of the army's wounded, injured and ill members, the royal joined in a game of wheelchair Australian Football League with soldiers from the recovery centre and the 1st Brigade. During his time in the Kununurra region he was briefed on operations and trained in bush survival lessons, including how to source food and water. After receiving his orders, Harry headed out on patrol with members of the force, spending two nights camping out in the remote outback. His attachment with the Australian Defence Force will continue after Gallipoli commemorations in Turkey, when he will return to Australia to spend time with Australian Army units in Perth and Sydney.

Taking flight: Two Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) Tigers from 1st Aviation Regiment take off from Robertson Barracks . The prince was briefed on NORFORCE,\u00a0an Australian Army infantry regiment and one of three Regional Force Surveillance Units (RFSUs) employed to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance in remote areas of Northern Australia. Its area of operations covers 1.8million square kilometres, encompassing the entire Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia; the largest of any military unit in the world today. Locals who live in one of the most remote places on earth got the surprise of their lives when Prince Harry turned up unannounced. 'He just rocked up,' said delighted Barry Trust, a resident of the tiny township which sits 600 miles away from the nearest city - Darwin. Mr Trust, who was speaking to ABC News, described the royal visitor as 'a real delightful chap' and revealed that Harry is enjoying the Outback so much, he's contemplating a move there. 'We've invited him back again some time,' said Mr Trust. 'He'd love to - he said he'd love to live out this way, to get away from the media.

Prince Harry spent his first day on the placement paying his respects at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Canberra before reporting for duty. He also found time to meet some of the locals and hit the headlines when he revealed his true feelings about selfie photos. 'Selfies are bad,' he said, when asked to strike a pose by a teenage fan. He added: 'I know you're young but just take a normal photograph.' He will also briefly travel back to Europe for a visit to Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales later this month where he will take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. Striking a pose: Prince Harry poses with members of the local community, including Mr Trust. Locals described him as a 'delightful chap' Warm welcome: Prince Harry arrived in Australia earlier this month for his four week-long secondment . Agreed! He struck a pose next to a Redheads Rule sign but refused to pose for a selfie. He was visiting the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' said an aide. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. Saying hello: Harry's winning ways have endeared him to Australian locals from the start . All smiles: His first act upon arriving in Australia was to visit the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Clown Prince! He was happy to pull funny faces for the amusement of one little girl while meeting wellwishers . 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.' Harry entered military service in 2005, training at The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as an officer cadet and\u00a0was commissioned as an Army officer on Wednesday, 12th April 2006. He then joined the the Blues and Royals, and in early 2007 began secretly serving in the Helmand region of Afghanistan before his deployment was uncovered by an American newspaper, and he was brought back home. He was promoted to Captain, his current rank, in 2011 when he also went to America to learn to fly an Apache helicopter, before returning to fly missions in Afghanistan between September 2012 and January 2013.",

Asked if he recongises the quality Hazard and Pogba share in any other players, Lichtsteiner said: 'Players like this are not like fish in the sea, but Kingsley Coman has all the attributes to eventually be a very good striker.' Lichtsteiner was part of the Juventus team that won 1-0 in Turin last week against Monaco in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Only Arturo Vidal's penalty separated the teams that Tuesday night, though Juventus just as importantly avoided conceding an away goal to their French visitors.

        "article": "Tom Ballard plans to climb K2, 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak . A climber has set his sights on the summit of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - 20 years after his mother died attempting the same feat. Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen.

Mrs Hargreaves, pictured with her husband Jim and thier family, was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen . Tragic: Mr Ballard was just six years old when his mother died on her way down from the summit of K2 . Her decision to take on dangerous climbs while raising a young family was criticised by some, but she shrugged off the flak, saying that fathers who went climbing did not face the same scrutiny. When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb. Since then that's pretty much all I have done.'",

        "article": "It is a source of music, information and entertainment for millions of listeners around the world yet vast numbers of people are being denied the chance to enjoy FM radio. Many of the smartphones on sale today - including Apple\u2019s iPhones, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones and LG phones - come with built-in FM chips. However, nearly two thirds of smartphones do not have the feature activated. Now the radio industry, faced with the rise of digital radio, are calling for this to change. Many smartphones on sale today - including Apple\u2019s iPhones, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones and LG phones - come with built-in FM chips. However, nearly two thirds of these devices don't have the feature activated. Now the radio industry, faced with the rise of digital radio, are calling for this to change . Broadcasters, including the BBC, are pushing for the mobile industry to activate the FM chips within smartphones to allow users to access their free radio feature. It is thought many mobile phone network providers are reluctant to allow this because it would reduce demand for data used by streaming internet broadcasts. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in the US, which has been one of the loudest campaigners on the issue, also warns that FM radio on mobile phones could prove vital in an emergency. It said that FM radio is the most reliable way of broadcasting emergency information during times of national crisis and by allowing access to it on smartphones would mean such messages could reach almost everyone, no matter where they are. Norway has announced that it will be the first country in the world to switch off its FM radio signal. The Norwegian Government said it will turn off its FM transmitters on January 11 2017. With the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio, it seems likely other countries will follow Norway's example. The UK had planned to switch off its own FM service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations. It is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations. In the US, around 85 per cent of American adults still listen to AM/FM stations. The NAB claims that the top 10 phones on the market already include radio chips that are not activated and would have little impact on battery life. Jeff Smulyan, spokesman for the NAB on the campaign, told NPR that giving users FM radio would allow them to avoid expensive data charges and save battery life. He said: \u2018Listening to streaming drains your battery three to five times faster than listening to the exact same content on the FM chip. \u2018When the power grid is out, the only lifeline for the American public is having an FM tuner.\u2019 In the UK, many cheaper mobile phones come with FM radio activated. Smartphones produced by HTC and Motorola also come with the ability to listen to FM radio. Around 21 per cent of adults in the UK say they have listened to radio using a mobile phone or tablet at least once a month during 2014, but many of these may have been using apps rather than FM chips. In the US the figures are lower as the availability of phones with FM radio activated is lower. Devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone also contain the technology to allow FM radio listening \u2013 they are included on the chip that also receives WiFi and Bluetooth radio signals. In the iPhone 6, for example, the Murata 339S0228 chip has its FM functionality switched off. Devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone \u00a0also contain the technology to allow FM radio listening \u2013 they are included on the chip that also receives WiFi and Bluetooth radio signals. In the iPhone 6 (pictured), for example, the Murata 339S0228 chip has its FM functionality switched off . Other smartphones running Android, including some made by Samsung and LG, also suffer from the same problem. However, turning these on is not a simple task. Many of these phones also lack the FM antenna needed to receive a signal. Some phones use the headphone cords as an antenna, but this would need to be connected to the smartphone devices. There is also commercial resistance to activating these FM chips. Mobile service providers are increasingly attempting to attract customers by offering music streaming services, according to a report by US Congressional Research Service. Apple is also preparing to launch its own music streaming service. Other smartphones running Android also suffer from the same problem. Samsung's early models came with FM radio but the firm was criticised for not including it in the Galaxy S4 (pictured) FM is seen by some as an archaic technology that will be replaced with digital radio. Norway has become the first country to announce it will switch off its FM radio service in 2017 and other countries are expected to follow. However, the BBC has been leading a new project to combine internet radio with FM or DAB to produce a hybrid radio service. Called the Universal Smartphone Radio Project, is has been discussing how to develop the technology with smartphone manufacturers. Helen Boaden, director of BBC Radio, said: \u2018There is an enduring love for radio and easy listening on the move is critical for this. \u2018This UK-led global partnership is a response to listeners\u2019 demand for simple, charge-free radio in mobile phones.\u2019 In the US, 32 mobile devices now carry a NextRadio hybrid radio chip pre-installed. According to Craig Fugate, administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Administration, radio is critical in a crisis. Speaking in a video on the FreeRadioOnMyPhone.org campaign site, he said: \u2018As more and more people use their smartphones as streaming devices to get news, get radio, get a lot of things like that over their networks, I don't think people realize how vulnerable they get.\u2019 James Cridland, a radio futurologist, added: \u2018There's clear evidence that people love FM radio in their phone. \u2018I find it odd that US mobile networks seek to ignore what their consumers want, in favour of forcing them to pay more on data.\u2019 The CTIA-The Wireless Association, however, insists that mobile phone users prefer to stream, download and customize music playlists in a way that FM radio does not allow.",

        "article": "The South Korean government paid an eye-watering \u00a32.4million to the makers of the new Avengers movie to ensure the country is shown in a positive light, it has emerged. Much of the comic book film, Avengers: Age of Ultron, was shot in Seoul and the country's culture ministry agreed to cover a third of filming costs in the city on the agreement the Republic of Korea is shown as 'high tech' and 'modern'. The use of public funds in what appears to be an extreme case of product placement has been criticised by South Koreans - as officials are having to wait with the rest of the world to see if the film, released on Thursday, will lift the country's reputation out of the shadow of it's headline-grabbing northern neighbour. Scroll down for video . On set: Chris Evans suited up as Captain America as shooting on Avengers: Age Of Ultron got underway in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea last year . The production crew in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea last year during filming for\u00a0Avengers: Age Of Ultron . The move echoes that of Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM, who recently made headlines after leaked emails revealed  the Mexican government had offered the studios $20m to ensure a positive portrayal of the country in Spectre. Kim Young-gun, who overseas the Korean Film Council's (KOFIC) incentive program for foreign films, said the film could transform the status of Seoul, which has been largely overlooked by Hollywood compared to its regional peers. He told MailOnline: 'If we have that kind of huge film, which shows Korea in a more positive way, then we think the image of Korea will be changed in a positive way.' The locations featured in the film include Gangnam Boulevard, immortalised in the pop song Gangnam Style, and Cheongdam and Mapo Bridges which span the city's Han River. Before shooting began last year, local government and film industry officials signed an agreement with the filmmakers to ensure the country would be shown in a positive light. In an memorandum of understanding, Marvel Studios agreed it would 'portray Korea as a high-tech, modern country and shall avoid portraying the Republic of Korea in any negative manner.' Filming: Black Widow pictured on her motorbike (right) in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, filmed in the Sangam-dong district of Seoul, South Korea (left and right) Capital city:\u00a0Much of the comic book film, Avengers: Age of Ultron - released tomorrow - was shot in Seoul in South Korea . Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow in the new Marvel movie Avengers: Age of Ultron, out on Thursday . The sequel sees the Marvel Comics superheroes forced into action when a high-tech peacekeeping programme - Ultron - goes badly wrong . In return, the country's culture ministry agreed to pay 30 percent of the cost of production in Seoul, about \u00a32.4m. Only on Thursday will they know if it will boost the international image of the capital and make it as iconic abroad as\u00a0Asian metropolises like Tokyo. Kim said: 'KOFIC and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, also, are concerned about how they will portray Korea in the film, but we are looking forward to seeing the film on Thursday.' KOFIC has estimated the sequel to the 2012 hit The Avengers, which features an all-star cast including Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jnr, could attract some 620,000 extra tourists to the country. The film has already sold 94 percent of its presale tickets. Scarlett Johansson stuns at the European premier of\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron at\u00a0Westfield shopping centre in west London last night . Stars: The cast of Avengers: Age of Ultron attended the European premier of the film in London last night . Kim acknowledged there has been domestic criticism about the spending of public funds but said the money has been put to good use, claiming US producers are already expressing greater interest in the country. A US source close to the production of the film, however, insisted Marvel Studios has not altered production to appease Korean officials. 'If there was an agreement signed or a rebate involved, Marvel is always about (being) creative first and the script and the story come first, and then if they can shoot in an area that offers them an incentive, then that's just an extra bonus, that's extra good for them,' the source said. 'But it's not what drives their scripts or the stories they tell.' Media in strongly nationalistic South Korea have often complained the country has been overlooked or misrepresented in Hollywood. Starring role:\u00a0Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Scarlet Witch in the new movie, wrapped up for the premier last night . Dashing: Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and Chris Evans, aka Captain America, attend the European premier . On Monday, the national broadcaster KBS reported that the country has only had fleeting appearances in the film, usually in relation to North Korea. Seoul, it said, has been shown as indistinguishable from Tokyo. Nina Juna, senior manager of international affairs at the Seoul Film Commission, said the few previous appearances of Seoul on the silver screen have irked Korean audiences. She said: 'The depiction of a future Seoul in Cloud Atlas looked like a future Japanese city, not Korea.'",

        "article": "Angelina Jolie's acclaimed film about the kidnap and rape of a 14-year-old girl in Ethiopia has helped burnish her image as a human rights campaigner. But the Hollywood star is at the centre of controversy after the makers of Difret were accused of exploiting the real-life victim at the heart of its story. Aberash Bekele, 32, is angry at the filmmakers for using her story without her knowledge or consent, and failing, initially, to pay her compensation. Fear: Aberash Bekele (second left) believes the film could put her and her family in danger of reprisals . Hollywood glamour: Angelina Jolie, 39, has become increasingly known for her humanitarian work . Miss Bekele was abducted so she could be pushed into a forced marriage. She escaped but was put on trial for killing one of her abductors. While she was released by the courts, local elders forced her into exile away from her home and family. Miss Jolie, who helped produce the film, spoke about how it will 'make a change' in the world and it was screened last year at her Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted in London, co-chaired by then Foreign Secretary William Hague. But Miss Bekele believes the film, which has won awards around the world, could put her and her family in danger of reprisals. She was never consulted by the film-makers and did not give them permission to lay her traumas bare on screen. With the character based on Miss Bekele renamed Hirut and with the film focusing on her lawyer, the Ethiopian directors originally refused to acknowledge it was about her. Miss Bekele, now a mother of one, was the focus of a 1999 BBC documentary Schoolgirl Killer, made by journalist Charlotte Metcalf. Miss Metcalf, who saw Miss Bekele earlier this year, said: 'Aberash feels doubly abducted not to have had the story acknowledged as hers. It's an absolute outrage that they should pretend it could have been anyone's story and she's still fighting that. 'Today, she could be bathing in the glow of international admiration for her extraordinary courage and resilience. Instead she is invisible, her story taken.' Last year, Miss Bekele won an injunction banning the film from being shown in Ethiopia. Respected: The Oscar-winning actress is a special envoy for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and was awarded an honorary damehood by the Queen for her efforts . She obtained it on the night of the film's premiere in the country, just after the producers had screened a message from Miss Jolie in which she admitted it was based on the 'untold story of Aberash Bekele'. While an out-of-court settlement eventually led to Miss Bekele being paid a small amount of money, she still lives in poverty and feels she has been exploited by the film. She told an Ethiopian newspaper: 'My life is on the edge [financially] while they are planning to premiere my story in a glamorous way. That is not right.' Miss Jolie, 39, a mother of six who is married to fellow star Brad Pitt, 51, has become increasingly known for her humanitarian work. The Oscar-winning actress is a special envoy for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and was awarded an honorary damehood by the Queen for her efforts. Last year she spoke excitedly about Difret getting a wider release, saying: 'I cried for the first 20 minutes and then I smiled for the rest of it thinking I can't wait for the world to see it because it will make a change'.

        "article": "After hitting nine past Granada at the weekend, it's safe to say Real Madrid's attacking prowess isn't misfiring at present. And for Real boss Carlo Ancelotti he now faces the enviable dilemma of trying to fit in his array of stars into his starting line-up. However, as Spanish paper AS reports seven players into six spots doesn't go - with one set to be upset at being left out of his preferred 4-3-3 formation. Spanish papers report on the attacking selection that Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti now has at the club . For the first time since November midfield quartet Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez are all fit and available alongside famed 'BBC' triumvirate of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. Marca also recognises this issue at the Santiago Bernabeu. Leading with the headline 'Blessed Problem,' the publication states that Ancelotti will have to choose between either Isco or Rodriguez to finalise his best starting line-up. The Madrid-based paper further adds that the latter is the favourite due to his impressive stats in his debut season at Real to date. In all competitions so far, the 23-year-old has scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in comparison to Isco's five and six. Over in Italy, the fallout at the demise of giants Inter continues with Corriere dello Sport reporting that there is a huge divide between Italian and foreign playing and non-playing staff. The main issue of contention at the San Siro outfit appears to be at boardroom level though with Managing Director Marco Fassone and CEO Michael Bolingbroke  said to be wanting to take the club in different directions. Over in Italy, Corriere dello Sport focuses on the internal struggles at fallen giants Inter Milan . Meanwhile Tuttosport looks ahead at the Coppa Italia semi-final second legs taking place in midweek - with Fiorentina's clash against Juventus taking centre stage. The paper reports that Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri will pair star striker Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata together for the trip to Florence, while Viola manager Vincenzo Montella is looking for another moment of magic from on loan Chelsea midfielder Mohamed Salah. And finally in France, the reaction to Paris Saint-Germain's pulsatring 3-2 win at title rivals Marseille on Sunday continues. L'Equipe state that exciting affair at the Stade Velodrome is confirmation that Ligue 1 is progressing and becoming more appealing - while the result adds an extra spice to this year's championship race. As it stands, PSG sit top of Ligue 1 with 62 points after 31 games - just one ahead of second-placed Lyon and five ahead of Marseille in third. In France, L'Equipe reports that PSG's 3-2 win at Marseille is an indictment at the improvement of Ligue 1 .",

        "article": "The state of Oregon on Friday released 94,000 emails involving the fiancee of former Gov. John Kitzhaber, who resigned amid scandal earlier this year over allegations that the former first lady used her relationship with him to land contracts for her business. The emails show the very active role that Cylvia Hayes, Kitzhaber's longtime companion, played in his administration, as well as the tension that it sometimes raised with the governor's staff. Hayes routinely attended meetings, was copied on emails among senior staff and requested information or clerical assistance from state employees. Kitzhaber had downplayed her role in the administration, insisting she was not adviser or public official, which would require her to adhere to the ethics laws that he and his staff must uphold. Scroll down for video . Emails released by the state of Oregon show Cylvia Hayes, (right) fiancee of former Governor John Kitzhaber (left), shows that she played a very active role in his scandalous administration . Kitzhaber, a Democrat, resigned in February, saying the influence-peddling allegations surrounding Hayes had become too much of a distraction. The FBI is investigating and has issued subpoenas for the emails and thousands of other records. The emails released Friday are messages between Hayes and the official email accounts for staff members in Kitzhaber's office. Yet to be released are Hayes' interactions with officials in other state agencies, as well as emails from her personal accounts that discussed state business. Hayes has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the release of her personal emails. The emails show that Hayes was involved in policy meetings, and her input was sometimes sought on policy questions. In one example from April 2011, shortly after Kitzhaber took office, the governor's executive assistant sent an email to an aide assigned to Hayes. She had scheduled a meeting for two policy advisers, Kitzhaber and Hayes, but the governor had to leave early. 'They will discuss natural resource and jobs/economy-related issues,' the assistant wrote. 'The Governor will stay for 15 minutes; but I expect the meeting to last 30 minutes.' A year later, Hayes was asked to weigh in on a bill before the Legislature. 'Cheryl, Regarding bullet 3 of HB 4144, I would not like to see it removed,' Hayes wrote. 'That is counter to where we are headed with the ten year energy plan and implementing carbon accounting.' Hayes routinely attended meetings, was copied on emails among senior staff and requested information or clerical assistance from state employees . Her relations with staff sometimes caused tensions. In December 2012, Hayes sent a note to all staff asking them to buy $100 tickets to a fundraiser. Kitzhaber's chief of staff quickly replied: 'Cylvia, can I ask you not to use folks' state email to do fundraising requests. It puts the team in an awkward position given your role as First Lady.' Last year, Hayes complained to Kitzhaber's communications director, Nkenge Harmon-Johnson, that a speech she gave didn't go as well as it could have because a speechwriter hadn't finished a draft. The writer had shifted to work on a late-scheduled speech for the governor. Harmon-Johnson was later fired, in part because of her frosty relationship with the first lady, according to her termination letter. Hayes often sought opportunities to travel to conferences or speak to audiences. In December 2013, a spokeswoman for the Bend-LaPine Schools learned Kitzhaber and Hayes would be in town and invited them to a fundraiser to support scholarships for after-school sport and club programs. While the governor couldn't make it, Hayes said she would be 'happy to attend and make a few brief remarks about the Prosperity Initiative and how athletic scholarships helped me become a first generation college grad.' When the organizers said there's no room for her to speak but they'd still love her to come, she emailed her assistant: 'please find a nice way to decline.' Shortly after Hayes held a tearful news conference last October to acknowledge that she was paid to enter a fraudulent marriage in 1997 with a man seeking immigration benefits, she replied to an email from a European man she'd met at a conference. 'It sounds like maybe you have not seen the media firestorm I am in the midst of,' she wrote. 'It is very intense, painful and embarrassing. I do know it will pass as the campaign season closes. I will make a note to follow up with you in November to set up a call.'",

        "article": "Vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition, but do we really need pills to optimise our diet? Not according to nutritionist and author Sarah Flower, who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need. 'The cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health.' she told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . It's time to ditch vitamin pills for a diet rich in clean, fresh and unprocessed foods, says Sarah Flower . 'The typical western diet is heavily processed and sugar ridden,' explains Sarah, 'this makes us more susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.' And while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods, Ms Flower believes we are still not doing enough. 'We are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients.' she continued. 'A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said. Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. 'Pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said. And menstruating women may benefit from adding oils (Evening Primrose Oil) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate PMS symptoms (Ms Flowers recommends magnesium citrate). Always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day . 'Fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients, which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease,' Ms Flowers said. 'The more colourful your plate, the healthier the meal. Junk food tends to be bland and beige. 'Children especially need to be encouraged to try a variety of vegetables. One great incentive is to set up a reward chart for every new food they try. 'Get them into the kitchen as playing with food helps them become less fussy eaters.' The nutritionist is also a keen advocate of incorporating as much healthy fat as possibly into your diet. 'We have all been encouraged to follow a low fat diet, but we need to start embracing fats,' she said. 'Oily fish, nuts and seeds contain vital nutrients so ignore the calorie counts and give your body the healthy food it craves and needs. 'Healthy fat doesn\u2019t make you fat; a diet rich in processed carbohydrates and sugar makes you fat. 'A high carbohydrate, sugar rich diet keeps you hungry but also stops you absorbing vital nutrients, causes depression, fatigue and energy dips. Instead of taking supplements, eat 100g of dark chocolate (left) \u00a0or six oysters (right) for zinc . 'Eat real food and your body with thank you for it.' The foods listed below are some of the highest per vitamin and mineral. However, how you cook and prepare the food is vital. Vitamins are depleted during processing and cooking, so try to steam vegetables instead of boil, give a quick stir-fry and eat as many raw whole fruits and vegetables every day.' VITAMIN A . RNI (Reference Nutritional Intake): 700ug (micrograms) for men and 600ug for women per day. Eat: One portion of liver a week will ensure adequate Vitamin A. Why you need it: Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin. We can produce our own Vitamin A by eating carotenoids. Think orange or yellow foods such as carrots, mangoes, papayas and sweet potatoes. Liver, eggs, cheese and yoghurt also contain the best sources of Vitamin A. Ensure you have adequate levels of zinc and iron as deficiencies in these can deplete Vitamin A. CALCIUM . RNI: 700mg a day but this figure does vary depending on your personal circumstances and health. Think about how to boost your everyday foods as basic switches can really boost your nutrient content. Eat: 120g (or one tin) of sardines provides 500mg of calcium; spring greens contain 200mg per 100g; sesame seeds contain 160mg per tablespoons; three dried figs contain 150mg of calcium . Why you need it:\u00a0Calcium  makes up your bones and keeps them strong. 99 per cent of the calcium in your body is stored in bones and teeth. The remaining one per cent is in your blood and soft tissues, and is essential for life and health. Increase your green leafy vegetables for usable calcium. Other sources include dairy, nuts, soya beans and fish. Too much refined sugar and high protein diets can increase your need for calcium. VITAMIN B12 (Cobalamin) RNI: 1.5ug or 2.5mcg per day. Eat: 4g of yeast extract (roughly what you would use on one slice of toast). A 200g to 240g salmon fillet provides 5mcg of B12; shellfish; cow's liver; crab; fortified tofu products; red meat, cheese, and eggs. Why you need it:\u00a0B12 deficiency can cause anemia, fatigue, depression and has even been linked to dementia. Vegans need to be especially careful to maintain their B12 levels. Although you can get a little B12 from some vegetable sources, it is hard to digest and utilise so look at adding yeast extract and nutrition yeast flakes which give a \u2018cheesy\u2019 flavour to foods. If in doubt, use a multi vitamin or blend of B vitamins. Best sources are found in liver, red meat, chicken, and oily fish. You can also find B12 in dairy products. VITAMIN C . RNI: 40mg a day. If you take too much vitamin C (probably through supplementation), you will get loose stools and stomach cramps, so that is your indication to cut back. Eat: A 250g punnet of strawberries gives you 145mg of Vitamin C; one kiwi fruit gives you around 64mg of vitamin C . Why you need it:\u00a0Vitamin C is needed to keep our immune system in tiptop condition but is also needed for collagen formation, wound healing, gum health and cardiovascular health. You need vitamin C to utilise iron so if you are anemic, ensure you have adequate amounts of both. Cooking can destroy vitamin C so it is important to try to get some raw sources into your diet every day. 100g of liver (left) will give you 23mg of iron. Spread a yeast extract such as Marmite on your toast (right) for Vitamin B12 . VITAMIN E . RNI: 4mg per day. Eat: 100g of almonds provides you will 26mg; 100g of sunflower seeds give you 36mg; 100g of wheat germ provides you with 30mg of Vitamin E. Why you need it: Vitamin E is another fat soluble vitamin and as a powerful antioxidant, helps protect us from free radical damage, helps ease PMT, heals skin, reduces cholesterol and protects against cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E works better alongside vitamin C and selenium. The best source of vitamin E is wheat germ, oils made from seeds (sunflower oils, olive oil, almond oils) and nuts and seeds. ZINC . RNI: Men require slightly more zinc than women; 9mg for men and 7mg for women. Eat:\u00a0Six oysters will give you 30mg of zinc; 100g of dark chocolate is one whole bar of Green & Blacks. Why you need it:\u00a0Zinc is another great antioxidant, helping to support the immune system, aiding protein synthesis, maintaining sex health, and plays an vital role for maintaining a healthy heart. Processed foods and high sugar diets can lead to a deficiency in zinc, so opt for a diet rich in lean protein, eggs, seafood\u2019s, nuts, seeds, whole grains and some dairy. VITAMIN K . RNI:\u00a0On average you need 1mcg per kilogram of weight; for example, someone who is 70kg would need 7mcg per day. Eat: 100g of kale gives you over 800mcg of Vitamin K. Why you need it:\u00a0Vitamin K is needed for blood clotting, wound healing and bone health. The richest sources of vitamin K are found in green leafy vegetables, particularly Swiss chard, kale, broccoli and spinach. You can also find sources in tomatoes, olive oil, parsley and pepper. MAGNESIUM . RNI: 300mg per day. Eat: 125g fillet of mackerel gives you 116mg of magnesium; 100g of pumpkin seeds provides you with 530mg; spinach gives you 70mg per 100g; dark chocolate gives you 327mg per 100g. Why you need it:\u00a0Magnesium is vital for health and most women are deficient. It works in balance with calcium, helps combat stress and eases muscle tension. There is very little magnesium is not involved in. from energy synthesis right through to the metabolism of carbohydrates. When boosting your magnesium levels, opt for whole grains, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, lentils and figs. Calcium makes up your bones and keeps them strong. 120g of sardines provide 500mg of calcium . IRON . RNI: 8.7mg per day and up to 14mg for menstruating women per day. Eat: 100g of liver will give you 23mg of iron; pumpkin seeds 15mg per 100g; dark chocolate 17mg per 100g. Why you need it:\u00a0Iron is needed to transport oxygen around the body and deficiency can cause anemia and fatigue. If you are increasing your iron intake, ensure you also increase your Vitamin C as this is needed to utilise iron efficiently. Iron is found in red meats, particularly liver, nuts, seeds, beans, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. The good news is it is also found in dark chocolate. VITAMIN B6 (also known as pyridozine) RNI:\u00a01.4mg per day. Eat: One large banana gives you roughly 0.50mg of B6; one tin of tuna gives you 1.2mg of B6; . 100g of sunflower seeds provides you with 1.3mg of B6; 100g of bananas gives you 0.37mg; 100g of black-eyed beans gives you 0.36mg of B6. Why you need it:\u00a0Vitamin B6 is needed for the breakdown of proteins and plays a vital role in energy production. It also works alongside iron aiding the transportation of oxygen and maintaining heart health. B6 also works well alongside magnesium and Vitamin E in aiding PMT and mild depression. Once again, rich sources are found in liver, whole grains, brown rice and pulses.",

        "article": "An extraordinary image has emerged of what appears to be a cloud formation that draws uncanny similarities to an Aussie Digger wearing a slouch hat. The photo was taken by Brad Allan in Cape York, far north Queensland, as he was heading out fishing at the break of dawn when something caught his eye. Mr Allan, from the Archer River Roadhouse, says the image is quite fitting considering the upcoming centenary of Anzac Day. The 50-year-old describes it as 'the sunrise digger who's been watching over us for 100 years'. An extraordinary image has emerged of what appears to be a cloud formation that draws uncanny similarities to an Aussie Digger in a slouch hat . It was Easter Monday morning when Mr Allan decided to take the boat out to Weipa, a town in Cape York which is north west of Cairns, when he captured the amazing image. 'I was going out fishing at about 5.45am in the morning with my wife and some mates when I looked out at the horizon,' he said. 'I saw the remnants of a storm cloud which oddly looked like a soldier in a slouch hat. 'I quickly took out my phone and grabbed a few shots of the clouds before it changed in the space of five minutes. I guess I was at the right place at the right time.' The image was taken about two weeks before the 100th anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli. 'For those with a bit of an imagination, if you look closely at the clouds you can almost see facial features like a nose and moustache. It's quite eerie but I think it's also quite fitting considering it's the centenary of Gallipoli,' Mr Allan said. 'It's almost like the sunrise digger who's been watching over us for 100 years.' An Australian soldier stand during a ceremony for Anzac Day last year . This comes as travellers heading to Anzac Day events overseas have been urged to heed safety warnings and get insurance. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said more than 15,000 Australians planned to attend overseas events commemorating the centenary of Anzac Day, with services in Turkey, France, Belgium, Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. She said the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli was a significant event for all Australians. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said normal security precautions were in place at Gallipoli. He wouldn't confirm reports Australian spies and special forces personnel had been sent to Turkey amid fears of a terrorist attack. He said appropriate security measures were in place for an international event of this scale. The government has prepared a series of Anzac Day traveller bulletins online. For all destinations, the government urges travellers to take out travel insurance and register on the Smartraveller website. For Turkey, travellers should have a high degree of caution because of the threat of terrorist attack. Anyone travelling to Turkey will need to obtain a visa and only those with attendance passes will be able to attend the official 2015 commemorations. For Anzac Day events in France and Belgium, travellers are advised to exercise normal safety precautions.",

        "article": "They are a stunning visualisation of the art - and how it is orange. A\u00a0programmer\u00a0has created these stunning graphs to reveal the dominant colour of artworks through history . They show Orange has always been the most popular colour - although in recent years blue has\u00a0begun\u00a0to\u00a0catch up. The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute\u00a0who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project. 'There are a bunch of different sites where you can access (photos of) paintings, \u00a0for instance the BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. .'One of my favorites is the BBC's site where you can browse through over 200K of well organized paintings - an amazing resource. 'For many of these there is also information on the year they were painted, the artist, etc.' He believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong. 'I haven\u2019t found any data on the prices of blue, so that explanation is hard to elaborate on. 'However, it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange, which might speak against the pigment prices explanation. ' The same graph, but with only oil paintings .

        "article": "He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side . Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped . Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely . Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008 . Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career . He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the club . But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench . Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13 . FA Cup (1): 2003-04 . Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09 . FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013 . Champions League (1): 2007-08 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season . But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations . Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp . Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday . As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League .",

His parents worriedly reported him missing after he disappeared about 6pm. More than 100 locals joined a search for the toddler that lasted all day Saturday. However at 7pm, the boy's body was found in a pond at an old stone quarry, a short distance from where he was last seen, local network NBC 4. The quarry had been abandoned for years. Tragedy:\u00a0Leroy J. Toppins went missing about 6pm Friday while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His body was found in an adjacent quarry Saturday night . Scene: After a search spanning almost 24 hours, dive crews found the toddler's body about 7pm Friday in Sugar Creek Stone Quarry, a short distance from the family's house . The property is adjacent to the former Sugar Creek Stone Quarry. The quarry had been abandoned for several years. Search crews had been combing through the area for almost 24 hours, but were hampered by the area's conditions, according to Concord Green Fire Chief Ralph Stegbauer. 'Even the creek lines where the volunteers are working are very steep,' Stegabauer told WHIO. 'A lot of brush, a lot of trees and, of course, this time of year the water is up high so we have a lot of things in the water.' The boy's body was found about three feet from the pond's shore. Tragically, officials said the pond wouldn't have been there if it weren't for recent rain. No foul play: Police say they have no reason to consider the death of Leroy suspicious, believing he wandered off by himself . Police said the missing two-year-old was found dead in a runoff pond near his house in Fayette County. The quarry was adjacent to his family's home and had been abandoned for years . Police do not believe the death was suspicious. 'At this point there's nothing to indicate foul play,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth told\u00a0WLWT5. 'The family has been extremely throughout the process. 'We believe the child merely just wandered away and got too close to the water. 'We're never equipped to deal with death regardless of where it is, it's especially troubling when you have a small baby.' Washington Court House is a city of about 14,000, located between Cincinnati and Columbus.",

        "article": "Inspirational speaker Turia Pitt, who suffered horrific burns when she was caught in a bushfire, has revealed she still struggles to overcome her near-death ordeal. The 27-year-old said just the smell from a barbecue brought back the traumatic moment she was trapped for four hours where she suffered\u00a0burns to 65 per cent of her body. Speaking to a Networking WA audience at Crown Perth on Wednesday, the burns survivor said she still feels haunted when she talks about being caught in the bushfire when she competed in an ultra-marathon in Kimberley in September 2011. 'My heart rate has just gone up, my hands are sweating, my mouth is all of the sudden dry,' she said, The West Australian reports. 'This happens even if I go to a seemingly harmless barbecue. As soon as I smell that smoke, immediately I am transported back.' Scroll down for video . Burns survivor Turia Pitt said she still struggles to overcome her ordeal during a speech on Wednesday . The motivational speaker suffered burns to 65 per cent of her body when she competed in an ultra-marathon . Ms Pitt also revealed she ran her first marathon last month since the fire and clocked a faster time than before she was injured. 'As soon as I took that first step, it was as if all my worries and fears dissipated,' Ms Pitt said. 'I had finished the run but I also beat my time from before my injury.' The revelation follows after she successfully\u00a0underwent reconstructive surgery to rebuild a nose but she was not expecting complications where she had stopped breathing during the procedure. When Ms Pitt woke up from her surgery, she expected to wake up in the burns unit with a brand new nose but  the moment she woke up in intensive care, she revealed she just wanted to die. 'At that point, all I wanted was death because I had worked so hard just to end up in the same situation,' Ms Pitt said. But she marked a new milestone in her recovery after another harrowing heath scare where her family feared the worst as she told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'. Ms Pitt went on to publish a book about her experiences - aptly titled Everything to Live For and fund raised almost $200,000 for surgical charity Interplast, . As she embarked on her own road to resilience, Ms Pitt is currently training ahead of the 10-day fund raising trek along the Inca Trail in Peru where she is getting up early every morning to prepare. Ms Pitt also revealed she was back on the race tracks for the first time since the fire . Before: Ms Pitt spent more than two years in hospital, much of it wearing a compression stocking (left) after experiencing burns to around 65 per cent of the body. Her face is pictured right prior to the reconstructive surgery on her nose performed recently . New nose: Turia Pitt, pictured with mother Celestine and her new nose, was competing in an ultra-marathon through WA's Kimberley region in 2011 when she was caught in a bushfire . Soul mates: Turia Pitt's boyfriend, Michael Hoskin, has been by her side since the very beginning of her hospital experience . Prior to the bushfire, Ms Pitt, from Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast, worked as a mining engineer and a model . In an interview with Women's Day last month, her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone' during the nose reconstruction. 'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine. 'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media. Milestone woman: Ms Pitt published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For . Ms Pitt agreed to an out-of-court settlement with ultra-marathon event organisers Racing The Planet in 2014 . Ultra-marathon runner: Ms Pitt is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman in 2016 . Burns victim: Ms Pitt experienced burns to around 70 per cent of her body during the 2011 bushfire. After years of recovery, Ms Pitt told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long!' It's just the latest in a series of milestones for Ms Pitt, who starred on the front cover of magazine The Australian Women's Weekly in June 2014. The cover won praise for featuring Ms Pitt. Ms Pitt has headlined a number of a speaking opportunities and in June 2014 she trekked the Great Wall of China to raise more than $175,000AUD for the charity\u00a0Interplast. Interplast sends teams of volunteer medical workers to developing countries in Asia to provide free surgery for people suffering conditions including cleft lip and palate and burn scar contractures. Ms Pitt is hosting the second annual fund-raising Gala night on April 16 to raise  funds and awareness for Interplast. Ms Pitt told Woman's Day she is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman next year, following an operation to 'refine her nose and widen her nostrils'. Ms Pitt and Mr Hoskin currently live in Ulladulla, on the south coast of New South Wales.",

        "article": "A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by \u00a3345 to \u00a3975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices . The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game . Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay \u00a3345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost \u00a3975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season . Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.",

        "article": "Poland is set to build watchtowers along the border to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a local news agency reports. The towers, costing the Polish government \u00a32.5million, will range from 115ft to 164ft and help monitor the 124mile long border between the two countries using CCTV. The increased border monitoring comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and Poland, a member of both NATO and the European Union, over the conflict in Ukraine. Keeping an eye out: Poland is erecting watchtowers along the border to Russian exclave Kaliningrad (pictured) as tensions between the two countries are heightened . Last month, Moscow announced plans on placing state-of-the-art Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad  for what government representatives called a 'major military exercise'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been accused of singling out Poland as an enemy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, accusing it of training 'Ukrainian nationalists' and instigating unrest. 'We are currently in the test phase of the technical installations on the towers,' Miros\u0142awa Aleksandrowicz from the Warmia-Masurian Border Guard told the PAP news agency. The construction of the watchtowers, due to be finished in June, is set to cost the Polish government 14million zloty (\u00a32.5million) with a majority of the funding coming from the EU's External Borders Fund. Kaliningrad, which has a population of just under 1million, plays an important role in the maintenance of the Russian Baltic fleet. Getting ready: The CCTV towers will  will monitor the border between Poland and Kaliningrad, where Moscow recently announced they are set to place state-of-the-art Iskander missiles . When neighbouring countries Poland and Lithuania joined the EU in May 2004, strict border controls were imposed. Moscow has proposed visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the EU several times, but the motions have been rejected. The new border watchtowers will be erected at a time when tension around the Baltic Sea is reaching new heights. Last month, Swedish Air Force and NATO jets tracked four Russian combat aircraft - two long-range, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers and two Sukhoi Su-27 fighters - flying with their transponders turned off in international airspace over the Baltic Sea. NATO said it scrambled Danish jets and Italian jets based in Lithuania  to identify the Russian aircraft which it said were heading to Kaliningrad. 'The Russian military aircraft did not use their onboard transponder; they were not in contact with civilian Air Traffic Control and they were not on a pre-filed flight plan,' a NATO military officer said. Last month, Russian military maneuvers that spread from the Arctic to the Black Sea involved 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft.",

        "article": "A new mother and her baby were found dead on a cliff face after she was advised to stop taking an anti-psychotic medication so she could breastfeed. Charlotte Bevan had come off risperidone \u2013 a powerful drug used to treat illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder \u2013 before her daughter Zaani was born late last year. Four days after the birth, the 30-year-old walked out of Bristol maternity hospital without shoes or a coat and with her baby girl in her arms. Exit: Four days after giving birth, 30-year-old Charlotte Bevan (left) was able to walk out of Bristol Maternity Hospital without shoes or a coat and with her baby girl in her arms (right) The next day, police found her body two miles away on a cliff face of the gorge near the Clifton suspension bridge. Newborn Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck was later found close by. It emerged yesterday that Miss Bevan \u2013 who is believed to have had a history of severe mental health problems \u2013 had been advised by medics to stop taking the drug ahead of Zaani\u2019s birth. NHS guidance says mothers should take risperidone during pregnancy only if their doctor says they need to. It adds: \u2018If you take this medicine during the late stages of pregnancy or during labour, your baby may have some problems or withdrawal symptoms and may need to have some monitoring after birth.\u2019 At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Avon senior coroner Maria Voisin said \u2018breastfeeding advice given in relation to (Miss Bevan\u2019s) risperidone\u2019 was an issue she wanted to explore in an effort to prevent future deaths. Discovery: After a huge search, police found Miss Bevan's body two miles away on a cliff face of the gorge near Clifton Suspension Bridge. Newborn Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck was later found close by . She said: \u2018She was not taking risperidone \u2013 what action was being taken and what impact was that having on her mental health?\u2019 The coroner also said there were further questions for the hospital to answer, adding: \u2018The ward she was on - was it appropriate for her to be on and were all the staff trained and able to deal with her needs? \u2018Obviously there is the issue of Charlotte managing to leave the ward and the hospital unnoticed and unmanaged.\u2019 University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust launched a review into the care it offered Miss Bevan and her baby following their deaths in December. Immediately after Miss Bevan disappeared, friends and family said she had battled depression since her father\u2019s sudden death from a brain tumour in 2000. And it was suggested she had suffered a decline in mental health due coming off medication. Miss Bevan\u2019s boyfriend Pascal Malbrouck, her mother Rachel Fortune, and her sister were among the family at the short pre-inquest review held at Avon Coroner\u2019s Court in Flax Bourton near Bristol. Plea: Miss Bevan\u2019s boyfriend Pascal Malbrouck (left) and her mother Rachel Fortune (right) at a police press conference in December 2014 appealing for Miss Bevan and her baby to return after they disappeared . Family: Miss Bevan, who was found dead last year, is pictured with Mr Malbrouck (left) and Ms Fortune (right) When asked if she wanted anything raised at the inquest, Ms Fortune said her daughter had asked that Mr Malbrouck was not there during the birth. Investigation: An Avon and Somerset search and rescue team member works with police to search an area near Avon Gorge in Bristol in December 2014 . She said: \u2018I think it needs to be said that Charlotte decided Pascal was not present and I think that needs to be said. I think that says something.\u2019 The coroner also expressed her dismay when a Bristol hospitals trust representative said she still had little information on which medical witnesses would be called and what evidence they would offer. Trust representative Caroline Saunders said Avon and Somerset Police were gathering statements from health staff and they had not been passed on to her yet. But coroner Ms Voisin, who said another pre-inquest hearing would now have to be held in around two months, said: \u2018I would normally expect the Trust to be much more familiar with at least the chronology and the staff involved \u2013 not passing that over to the police.\u2019 She said it was also now unlikely the full inquest in to both deaths will take place until after the summer holidays. And she said to Miss Bevan\u2019s family: \u2018There is a lot more work to do and I am sorry if you think it is a slow process but I think in this case we should take things a little more slowly, a little more carefully, to ensure the best for Charlotte and Zaani.\u2019 Among those witnesses expected to provide evidence at the inquest will be Miss Bevan\u2019s care co-ordinators, midwives, a hospital porter, and a consultant psychiatrist.",

        "article": "Homesick Sam Tomkins insists it is not a foregone conclusion that he will return to Wigan when he cuts short his New Zealand Warriors stay at the end of the season. The 26-year-old England full-back is interesting his former club, where his brother Joel plays, and Wigan have an option to bring him back to the DW Stadium. When announcing his departure barely 18 months ago, Wigan announced they could re-sign Tomkins on a 'defined salary' on his return to Super League. Sam Tomkins has been released by the New Zealand Warriors after feeling homesick . And while Tomkins says it would 'be nice' to resume his Wigan career, he is tentatively exploring alternative options too. Asked where he would be playing next, Tomkins said: 'I've not worked that out just yet. The first thing was to sort it out over here that I could go back. 'Hopefully that'll be sorted in the not-too-distant future.' Wigan is where Tomkins launched his career, playing for the club from 2008 to 2013, so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season's Grand Final runners-up. 'That's where my brother's playing and that's where I'm from, but I'm open to other places. I'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me,' he said. 'Wigan would be nice but I know it's not the only team I can go to.' Before the announcement on Wednesday morning that Tomkins will be on the move, Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told Wigan Today: 'If he became available we would be very interested. 'We've got the first option. If it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands. And I'll be delighted if that was the case.' Tomkins has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave. Rather than not settling into the New Zealand game, it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at Tomkins, unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of England. He told Sky Sports News: 'I've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but New Zealand is pretty far from Wigan, where all my family live, so I want to be back in England around my family. Tomkins celebrates winning the Super League Grand Final with Wigan in 2013 having spent five years with club . 'I'll be two years I've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what I'd rather be doing next year.' A replacement for Tomkins has already been found by New Zealand Warriors, with Kiwi international Roger Tuivasa-Sheck agreeing a three-year contract that will take effect from next season. Tuivasa-Sheck will join from Sydney Roosters, with New Zealand Warriors head coach Andrew McFadden describing the 21-year-old on Wednesday as 'a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing'. That has cleared the way for Tomkins, currently sidelined with a minor knee injury, to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three-year contract. Tomkins joined the Warriors for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of \u00a3700,000. 'They invested a lot into me to get me over here which I appreciate,' he said. 'They handled that brilliantly when I was coming and again equally so when I've asked if I can leave. 'It was tough because I feel like I owe them something and hope I can pay them back with another big year this year.' New Zealand Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said of Tomkins: 'He came here excited about testing himself in the NRL and also experiencing living in a new country but, in the end, Sam has found it too much of a challenge being away from home. 'It's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow Sam to return to England.'

        "article": "With the 2015 general election just over two weeks away, it's natural to expect flyers, bumper stickers and perhaps even the odd car flag to pop up across the nation. However, you might be more surprised to see shot glasses emblazoned with David Cameron's face, UKIP pendents and even party leader underwear appearing on shelves. This year's election has bought with it a bizarre batch of merchandise in a bid to sway the nation. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is said to have watched Bake Off in the past which could explain these cake cases . Many of the unusual trinkets can be purchased on the official party websites which often include a 'gift' category, should you want to bring politics into their special day. Perhaps dad might like an SNP decanter for his wine, or mum could bake in her new set of Conservative cupcake cases, while Ukip have focused on a more wearable range of accessories. We're not entirely sure that any of these will fly off the shelves but here we round up the weirdest official - and unofficial -  collectibles as we prepare to go to the polls. CONSERVATIVE CUPCAKE CASES . David Cameron has previously revealed that he has watched The Great British Bake Off, which might explain these rather pricey cupcake cases. The pack of 36 patriotic cases, in Tory blue with a Union Jack design, comes in at \u00a35 a pop. UKIP PENDANT . We know it isn't advisable to wear your heart on your sleeve but what about your political opinion around your neck? This Cornish Pewter pendant is available from the party's store for \u00a312 and is described as an 'ideal gift for Ukip enthusiasts'. Political party underwear insures that politicians remain the butt of the joke . LEADER UNDERWEAR . Political leaders are used to being the butt of the jokes, and one retailer has taken this a step further. Twisted Tee, has created a range of 'political man pants' - capacious white garments printed with the faces of the party leaders. The pair of Nick Clegg undies are described in ironic terms: 'Hand printed gingerly in London on to 100 per cent white cotton Y front. 'For men who don't quite know whether they dress to the right or left.' DAVID CAMERON SHOT GLASS . The David Cameron shot glass is one way of getting you through the lengthy process . A set of David Cameron shot glasses could be the perfect excuse for a general election drinking game. Now CafePress is offering the custom ceramic vessels emblazoned with the Prime Minister's picture for \u00a311 each. Knock back a shot for every time he says 'hard working people' however, and you may find yourself needing to make cuts of your own. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 18TH BIRTHDAY CARDS . Keen to snap up new voters the minute they become of age, the Lib Dems have created their own 18th birthday cards. The plain cards simply say, 'Wishing You a Happy Birthday' above the figure '18' written out in blue and filled with the party's yellow bird logo. If anyone knows a large number of 17-year-olds with birthdays looming, the party's official store offers the cards in packs of 100 for \u00a334. SNP PICNIC BLANKET . The SNP picnic blanket is the ideal way to showcase your political opinion in the great outdoors . The SNP, with a revitalised Nicola Sturgeon at the helm, are dedicated to getting their message out there. So dedicated in fact that they are not prepared to miss a single opportunity to spread the word. The foldaway tartan picnic rug allows you to air your political views in the great outdoors for the price of \u00a345. SNP HIGH VIZ JACKET . The SNP aren't missing a trick when it comes to merchandising. With this handy high viz vest you can showcase your political orientation with pride in all hazardous situations and for the meagre price of \u00a38. The e-cigarette liquid comes in five flavours one for each of these leaders . ELECTION E-CIGARETTE FLAVOURS . In a bizarre addition to the already unusual election memorabilia being sold, Totally Wicked's Red Label has produced five e-cigarette liquids pairing with five of the party leaders. Varieties include Cameron's Eton Mess, a strawberry and meringue flavour inspired by the PM's old school. Miliband's Rocky Red is based on the seaside treat of teeth-cracking rock as 'being leader of the opposition is often described as the worst job in British politics, so where better to escape to for a break than the great British seaside, famous not just for being a great holiday destination but also for hosting many party political conferences.' For an e-cigarette inspired by Nigel Farage, the site says: 'We all know Nigel Farage likes his ciggies and a pint, now it turns out he is also a vaper! So we've made this e-liquid especially for him. A full tobacco flavour with a dash of beer, topped with a note of espresso.' The official Conservative shop is selling baby clothes meaning they can start their opinions early . MINI THATCHER BABY CLOTHES . Many parents are known to push their views on to their offspring and in this case they're starting early. The official Conservative website stocks baby clothes including Babygros and bibs with Little Iron Lady (Margaret Thatcher's famous nickname printed on the front.) Baby's first election might be more appropriate. You can now own Nick Clegg's apology on MP3 with proceeds going towards a children's charity . NICK CLEGG, I'M SORRY- THE SINGLE . Re-live Nick Clegg's apology over the Liberal Democrats' climbdown on tuition fees in full auto-tune glory with this MP3 edition with an album cover mocked up to resemble The Clash's seminal album, London Calling. Available to buy for \u00a30.99, the proceeds go towards The Children's Hospital Charity. SNP DECANTER . It appears that the SNP area about ready to brand just about anything. This crystal decanter engraved with 'Scottish N Proud' would make an excellent novelty gift during the election. With a \u00a375 price tag, however, it may make an awkward heirloom if the SNP aren't elected. But on election night itself, what better way to pass the time as the votes are counted. UKIP LADIES SILK SCARF . Want an elegant way to showcase your support for Nigel Farage and his party? Look no further than Ukip's silk 'pound' logo printed on a pale, sheer scarf. The party's website assures that it is a 'delicate chiffon' in a 'gentle lilac' so as to avoid being too ostentatious. And although it may feature a pound sign pattern, it is a thrifty purchase coming in at \u00a33. The UKIP silk scarf is supposed to be the sophisticated way of showing your support for the party . These life sized cardboard cutouts make a great addition to the office...apparently . PARTY LEADER CARDBOARD CUT-OUT . Some might say there's not much difference between our biggest political figures and these cardboard cut-outs. Fortunately we can find out for ourselves as the  free-standing Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg figures are available at Amazon for \u00a329.99. For those of you unsure of what you would do with a life size political leader, the website provides the following suggestions: 'Suitable for gifts, bedroom decoration, home theatre decoration, wall decoration, kid's bedrooms, office desks and parties.' Choc on Choc have decorated their latest offerings with Nick (left) Ed (centre) and David (right) PARTY LEADER CONFECTIONARY . Choc on Choc have embellished their artisan chocolates with a rather unusual decoration: the faces of three of the party leaders. David Cameron\u2019s bar is studded with blueberry pieces, Ed Miliband\u2019s comes in a red raspberry flavour and the Nick Clegg edition is filled with chunks of honeycomb. SNP TEA LIGHT HOLDER . The SNP tea-light holder literally allows you to hold a candle to Nicola Sturgeon . What better way to hold a candle to your favourite party than with an actual candle. It's less ostentatious than some other SNP souvenirs but it still has a certain glow... for \u00a315 a holder. UKIP DOG T-SHIRT . We're assuming this is for a canine who is not a Farage fan judging by the gesture on the reverse, but last time we checked dogs can't vote anyway. But if you wish to cause a stir in the park opt for this \u00a317.95 tee from Zazzle.",

Experts in America found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent. Research carried out by scientists at Texas Tech University showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of \u00a3100,000 would only have \u00a363,000 today. If they had resisted the temptation to sell, the same pot would be worth \u00a3141,000 today provided they had not spent any of the cash. It comes just days before retirees in Britain are given the power to decide how to spend their life savings for the first time ever in the biggest shake-up of pensions for almost a century. The Daily Telegraph quotes the authors of the study, Michael Finke and Chris Browning as saying: \u2018Avoiding mistakes requires the ability to regulate emotions through our more rational cognitive process. \u2018Consumers are increasingly responsible for managing their retirement savings... (but) we also find that cognitive scores decline with advance age.\u2019 The newspaper says 1,204 retired people with investments between 2006 and 2008 were analysed as part of the study, which has been published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs. It reveals that retirees with better-than-average ability to solve \u2018logic problems\u2019 were more unlikely to make misjudgments in the investment market based on their emotions. The authors add: 'Lower levels of cognitive ability in old age can reduce an investor's ability to control emotional responses to a loss. Anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn\u2019t in a final salary scheme will soon be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need, under reforms announced by George Osborne (pictured) 'Greater sensitivity to loss may increase preferences for safety following a market decline, resulting in allocations away from stocks that are associated with long-term underperformance.' Under reforms announced by Chancellor George Osborne, anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn\u2019t in a final salary scheme will simply be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need from April 5. They could keep the money invested in the stock market to boost their profits. And if they die their spouse or loved ones will be able to inherit whatever is left over.",

        "article": "The Kardashians might be at the forefront of fashion trends, but apparently not the waist-trimmers, or 'girdles' as Sophie Falkiner calls them. Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, Sophie Falkiner reveals she's been ahead of the trend, ten years before the Kardashians began Instagramming it. While Khloe Kardashian recently attributed the corset-like waist trainer as the tool behind her new, slim figure, Falkiner says she discovered the benefits while interviewing Hollywood plastic surgeons for a work assignment years ago. Scroll down for video . Slim Sophie: Sophie Falkiner says she has been cinching in her waist with girdles long before the Kardashians . Waist workout: Kim (left) and Khloe (right) Kardashian swear by corset-like waist trainers for slimming their waist . 'With any surgery, whether liposuction or trauma surgery, the surgeons all said it's important to wear protective gear afterwards,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'So when you have a baby and have excess skin, all the surgeons in LA said that\u2019s what they would recommend to their patients after having babies.' 'Wearing girdles really worked for me. The thicker, the better,' Falkiner has previously told Sydney Morning Herald. Bounce back: Jessica Alba also swore by girdles for getting back her pre-baby figure . Falkiner said that her sister, a nurse in Singapore, also noticed girdles were trending for quite some time in hospitals in Singapore as a common recommendation for  women needing a protective layer after a c-section. 'I don't believe in  cinching in your waist just because, but I do believe in high-waisted, good old fashioned Spanx after having baby,' she said. 'All my girlfriends who I've told since to do it have managed to get their bodies back after three months and they now swear by it.' Model mother: As a mother to two, Falkiner says having a tight Spanx like waist trimmer is key to her figure . While she says she isn't sure about the science behind it, she believes it definitely works - and  Jessica Alba also swore by it for getting her pre-baby bod back too. So if she does, it's definitely the real deal. 'Since then I've passed the Spanx around to all my girlfriends having babies,' she said. 'I don\u2019t believe in starving yourself after, so while it takes a while to snap back in, you will feel better. And if you look good, you'll feel good,' says the trim, mother and presenter.",

        "article": "A white supremacist with a split tongue and 'Satan' tattooed on his face has been sentenced to life in prison for stabbing a black man to death. David Adam Pate from Lancaster, North Carolina, told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. The 25-year-old serial criminal, who pleaded guilty to the murder on Thursday, told police he just wanted to 'cut his dad gum head off,' and that he cut him with a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween.' During an interview after his arrest, he even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault. Why would anyone go drinking and go into the woods with someone who looks like me? ' Scroll down for video . Jailed: David Adam Pate, 25, (mugshot from 2013 left and in court on Thursday right) from Lancaster, North Carolina told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for the slaying . During the sentencing hearing, James's two brothers described him as the 'devil', admitting that they wanted him to suffer in prison. One of them, who spoke at his sentencing, said a man like that 'doesn't deserve to live on this earth' before storming out of the court screaming in distress. According to The Charlotte Observer, police found at least 20 knives, both store bought and homemade, and more than 20 masks in Pate's home after he was arrested, when children who were playing in the woodland found the victim's decomposing body. He was already in jail at the time, having been arrested for disorderly conduct two weeks before. As he was booked into custody, officers took a frightening mugshot of Pate. He stuck out his split tongue and revealed a 974 tattoo on his neck - the sign of the white power gang, Gangster Disciples. Emotionless: Prosecutors said Pate deserved to die in prison. He has never offered the James family an apology for the 'senseless and remorseless' act . Confession: The 25-year-old told police during a taped interview used a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween' to kill James (right) During a police interview, he described how he covered James's remains up because he wanted to kill someone in the same place. He said he tied James with a rope from neck to ankles so that he could drag the body away after the stabbing site, but was too drunk and tired to continue to try and drag James's body to a nearby creek. Prosecutors added they they thought Pate deserved to die behind bars. Solicitor Randy Newman told the court: 'This is an evil man standing before you. If anyone deserves life in prison, it's David Pate.' Judge Dan Hall sentenced Pate to life in prison with no chance for parole, calling the murder a 'senseless and remorseless' act. Pate has never spoken to the family or offered an apology. Horrifying: After he was arrested Pate even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault. Why would anyone go drinking and go into the woods with someone who looks like me.'",

Ibe has been absent for the last six weeks after he damaged his knee ligaments during a Europa League tie against Besiktas in Istanbul. Before that, though, he had said he had been in outstanding after Rodgers had to thrust him into the spotlight. The young England international spent the first half of the season on loan at Derby County but he returned to Anfield in January and made an immediate impact, with a Man-of-the-Match performance in the Merseyside derby on February 6. Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe in action for Brendan Rodgers' side in the Europa League against Besiktas . Liverpool initially thought Ibe would be out for no longer than four weeks but they have been careful not to rush him; in recent weeks, however, his training has been to a high level and Rodgers will include him in his squad to face Newcastle on Monday. Liverpool\u2019s manager said: \u2018Young Jordon will come back in and I've got to say he's looked absolutely sensational in training. He's been out for a while but he's been a couple of weeks now out on the field doing his preparation work and he's joined in the training. \u2018Absolutely outstanding, he\u2019s looked. He's got real natural fitness and he'll come into the squad for Monday night.\u2019 Ibe was awarded the\u00a0Man-of-the-Match having performed magnificently in the Merseyside derby in February . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers dishes out the instructions during training on Saturday . The 19-year-old (right) has done well since breaking into the Liverpool first team and is seen as a key member . There will not, though, be a return for Mario Balotelli. The striker has been sidelined for the last two games, first with a knee problem then with illness and Rodgers is planning for the game without the Italy striker. \u2018We'll assess that over the next couple of days,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018He was injured against Arsenal and has been ill since the midweek and continues to be. We'll see over the next 24 hours.\u2019 Liverpool have dropped off the pace in the race for a top four spot following back-to-back defeat against Manchester United and Arsenal but if Louis van Gaal\u2019s side beat Manchester City and Rodgers sees his team beat Newcastle, there will be a glimmer of light.

Midfielder Joe Allen keeps hold of the ball under the attention of Dejan Lovren during the training session . Wednesday\u2019s win over Blackburn in the FA Cup has lifted the atmosphere at Melwood and Rodgers has urged his players to focus on their job. \u2018The performance and the result the other night puts us back on track again,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Hopefully from that result we can build the momentum through until end of season. It was excellent performance and a good result in a tough tie. We\u2019ll just take each game at a time now and really focus on the Newcastle. \u2018The teams in there now have the advantage.

        "article": "(CNN)By the elation online and in the streets, you'd think Iran had just won the World Cup. But this is bigger. Iranians erupted in celebration as young people waved flags from their sunroofs, blasted music from stereos and chatted online with the hashtag #IranTalks. The excitement came after a breakthrough nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers that promises to end Iran's international isolation under years of crippling sanctions. Just before midnight on Thursday, Vali Asr street, one of Tehran's main thoroughfares, turned into something like a block party. Car horns blared. Men danced in the middle of traffic. Some people flaunted U.S. dollar bills. It was a fitting double occasion: The agreement was struck on the final day of Persian New Year festivities, symbolizing a fresh start. Milad, a 20-year-old university student among the crowds, told CNN he was happy about the accord but wary about his own future. \"I still believe I'll have a hard time finding a job that pays well, with or without this deal.\" Another Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, said \"Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news.\" \"This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community.\" At home that evening, families watched as Iranian state television broadcast U.S. President Barack Obama's speech live, which came for many as a surprise. Some Iranians celebrated the moment by snapping selfies in front of the TV. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif \u2014 who led the Iranian negotiation team \u2014 received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as the vehicle rolled slowly down the packed street, carrying the man who struck the historic deal. Other videos posted to social media showed Zarif mobbed by fans in Switzerland, who yelled \"We love you, Zarif!\" Lausanne: Zarif joins Iranian students cheer \"Zarif We Love You\" outside press conference at #IranTalks. pic.twitter.com/S2dVzeAsZl . Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian-American independent journalist, celebrated with her friends in the United States by singing \"Bayram Mubarak,\" a New Year song. Happy New Day, New Year, New Era. #IranTalks pic.twitter.com/OuGE3pu8Z1 . She closely followed the reaction from Iranians around the world and told CNN she saw an \"explosion\" of joy when the deal was finally struck. \"I didn't expect so many people to follow it so closely, but from the result, I can tell everyone was following.\" \"After 35 years of animosity, U.S. and Iran diplomats shook hands and stood by each other in public... everything is just pushing this forward.\"",

'This season, in a lot of games we've played well but teams have tended to raise their game against us. It's just how it is, that's not me moaning.'

        "article": "A jealous boyfriend stabbed his love rival to death after he threatened show intimate photographs of her to her Imam father. Gulam Chowdhury, 24, quoted verses from the Quran before stabbing Mohammed Yasser Afzal 20 times in the east London mini cab office where his victim worked. The court heard that Nargis Riaz, 22, was terrified that Mr Afzal would show intimate photographs to her father who was a strict Imam. Gulam Chowdhury, left, stabbed his love rival Mohammed Afzal, right, 20 times at an east London cab office . The Old Bailey heard that Mr Afzal had threatened to show intimate pictures of Nargis Riaz, to her Imam father . The Old Bailey heard that Ms Riaz had been involved in a relationship with Chowdhury and Mr Riaz for several weeks before the murder on March 24, 2014. Her parents were unaware she was friendly with either man. Chowdhury told Ms Riaz, a second year law student at City University, the attack was justified in Islam claiming: 'Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife.' Later he reassured her: 'Don't worry little angel, it's me who's a psycho not you.' Chowdhury showed no emotion today as a jury of seven men and five women found him guilty of the murder of Mr Afzal, 22, on March 24 last year. Riaz, who was also standing trial for murder, faces a retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict after 21 hours and 37 minutes\u2019 deliberation. Co-defendant Muhammed Khan, 23, was acquitted of assisting an offender. The court heard Ms Riaz had been dating both Chowdhury and Mr Afzal in the weeks before the murder, but kept both relationships from her strict parents. Dramatic CCTV footage showed masked Chowdhury storm the E20 minicab company in Stratford Broadway, east London on March 24 last year. Muhammad Khan, pictured, was acquitted of assisting an offender at the Old Bailey . He vaulted the counter armed with a carving knife as Riaz was stood outside during the frenzied attack. Detectives investigating the murder found a series of texts from Chowdhury to her in the weeks leading up to the attack. In one message, Chowdhury repeatedly asked Riaz if she wanted his rival dead and told her: \u2018No one hurts Nargis and lives\u2019. Having converted to a strict form of Islam while held in an immigration detention centre, Chowdhury regularly quoted the Quran in his messages to Riaz. He told her: \u2018I\u2019m going to sort this out and sort it proper, I will use the flame from my ancestors to burn the world of this scum.\u2019 He also wrote in another message that his ancestors were \u2018fearless lions that would kill for honour\u2019. Chowdhury claimed killing was justified by Islam and included a passage from the Quran which said: \u2018Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife\u2019. In another text he wrote: \u2018I need to kill someone\u2019. Prosecutor Sandip Patel QC said Riaz was treated \u2018like a Queen\u2019 by Mr Afzal, but had threatened to show intimate pictures to her parents during a \u2018difficult phase\u2019 in their relationship. \u2018They had known each other before and had been boyfriend and girlfriend in the past but Mr Afzal was unaware Miss Riaz was at that time seeing Mr Chowdhury,\u2019 he said. Riaz, who also worked at Primark in Hackney, claimed she did not believe Chowdhury would carry out his threats. Chowdhury, from Barking, denied, but was convicted of murder. He was held at Broadmoor secure hospital prior to the trial, and was initially deemed unfit to plead due to mental health problems. Riaz, also from Barking, denied murder. Khan, from Dagenham, Essex, denied assisting an offender between March 24 and March 26, 2014 and was acquitted. Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve of the Homicide and Major Command said: 'Gulam Chowdhury carried out a ferocious assault on Mohammed Afzal. The level of violence used was shocking and ensured that Mohammed would not survive the attack. 'Whatever Mohammed's motives were for the actions he took in attempting to maintain his relationship with a woman, he did not deserve to be murdered. 'It is thanks to the thorough and meticulous work of my officers who have worked tirelessly since Mohammed's murder that we have managed to prove Chowdhury planned, and then executed, this vicious assault which ended in the savage murder of a young man.' Eyewitnesses described how Chowdhury was wearing a distinctive 'JD Sports' shoulder bag shortly before the murder. Officers then were able to place him at the scene using CCTV footage and mobile phone cell data analysis. Chowdhury is due to be sentenced on May 1.

In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes which premiered on Thursday at Tribeca Film Festival, Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat his wife and other women online. For those hungry to learn  about Valle and his stomach-churning fantasies, the film will also be shown on HBO in May. Scroll down for video . Thought Crimes :In the HBO documentary Thought Crimes 'cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle talks about his 2012 arrest and the claims that allegedly plotted to kidnap, torture, and eat women online . Family time: Gilberto Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs and he makes jokes about people feeling afraid when they see him with a fork . Months before his arrest in late 2012, Gilberto Valle, then a New York police officer, sat at his computer, hiding behind fictional online identities and exchanging messages about murdering and eating women . 'When you\u2019re behind a computer screen late at night, no one knows who you are, where you are,' Valle says in the opening of the documentary. 'I became part of this cyber-community, where people are exploring deviant thoughts and exploring their fetishes,' he added. 'And then you shut the computer off, and that\u2019s it. I go back to being the regular me. But someone might say the anonymous nature could also bring out who you really are. In my worst nightmare, I could never guess that this would have happened.' Valle, often at his mother's house, is seen cooking in the film but he's only making bacon and eggs. 'Nobody\u2019s alarmed I have a fork in my hand with people around? Everybody's good?' Valle asks at one point when sitting down to eat. Valle insists throughout the film that he never intended to actually hurt anyone. He says he just has dark fantasies. 'This was something that was private, anonymous, it was a little bit of a skeleton in my closet,' Valle says, brushing off his dark thoughts. The New York Daily News reports that the director of the film Erin Lee Carr said that she wanted to portray Valle in as neutral of a light as possible. Originally convicted: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed by local media as the 'Cannibal Cop' after a guilty verdict was delivered at his trial as seen in this courtroom sketch .

Carr is the daughter of New York Times columnist David Carr who died in February. In the film Valle's father, Gilberto Valle Sr., says his son was guilty of being an imaginative writer. 'He created a monster. He\u2019s a good writer,' he says. At the end of the film, Valle expressed his desire to meet a woman. 'I think sometimes I\u2019m craving a little, you know, craving some companionship,' he says.

Valle has been out of jail since July after being cleared of conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women. His trial included lurid details of how he sought advice from others in the online 'death-porn' community over how to kidnap, kill and eat his wife and friends. He was sentenced to time served in November for illegally accessing a federal database. He was also given a year's probation on a charge of misusing police resources to search for women as part of his fantasies. Valle was ordered to continue mental health treatment and was banned from contacting women involved in the case. 'I really want to say I am sorry - it was not a crime but it was wrong,' Valle said outside court in November. Another chance: District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan threw out the conviction of Gilberto Valle, 30, after federal public defenders argued that the U.S. Constitution grants people the right to fantasize . During his trial, the jury heard how Valle communicated in chat rooms about killing and cooking his wife. He told one man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.' In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone. The chat room discussion centered on cooking the victim, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. Valle had been facing life in prison but the charges were thrown out in July, with the judge writing that ' more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play'. Family support: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle , his mother Elizabeth Valle, and his father Gilberto Valle leave the U.S. District Court . The former cop's defense lawyers said Valle recognized that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and now meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it. They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ''Cannibal Cop.'' 'He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.' Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Valle's ex-wife, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce last July. She took the couple's young daughter and completely cut off contact with Valle and his family.",

        "article": "Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer. Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro . The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns \u00a3220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park .",

        "article": "Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a father and his 13-year-old daughter were bashed and robbed by a gang of 25 teenagers outside a shopping centre. Tibor\u00a0Racsits, 42, had gone to pick up his daughter\u00a0Kiara from the movies at Charlestown Square in Newcastle, north of Sydney, on Sunday night when they were attacked.

Tibor Racsits, 42, had gone to pick up his daughter Kiara from the movies at Charlestown Square in Newcastle, north of Sydney, on Sunday night when they were attacked . His daughter can be heard screaming as she runs to help, but she is pushed from behind by a young girl and slams face-first into the concrete. Mr Racsits said he went to pick his daughter up after she called to say some girls wanted to assault her, the\u00a0Newcastle Herald\u00a0reports. There had earlier been some trouble between Kiara and at least one girl before she called. As he went up the escalators and called his daughter telling her to come out of the movies, he noticed three girls standing nearby. 'And within 15 seconds, there was like 20 of them. I don't even know where they came from,' he said. The incident took place outside the\u00a0Charlestown Square shopping centre in Newcastle, north of Sydney . Vision of the disturbing attack showed Mr Racsits being dragged across the road by at least three young men before being kicked in the stomach and head . 'They must have been hiding. I think it was a set-up, it was planned. 'They just swarmed and when I looked around I just thought oh s**t there is going to be trouble here.' Mr Racsits was walking his daughter down the stairs when he pushed a young man out of the way to get to their car. 'But as soon as I have pushed him out of the way, there was just kicks and punches from the side,' Mr Racsits told the newspaper. He was dragged about 10 metres across the road before they started punching and kicking him.

        "article": "If Dartmouth College students have the same inflated influence on presidential politics that they've traditionally enjoyed, Hillary Clinton has some long days ahead in New Hampshire. Of a randomly selected group of 50 students who said they followed presidential politics enough to comment, just nine told Daily Mail Online that the former secretary of state would make a good U.S. chief executive. Hillary's detractors were far more passionate than her fans \u2013 a potential problem since she needs a repeat of her grassroots-driven upset 2008 victory here in order to solidify her status as the Democrats' standard-bearer. Stacey Benton, a government major from Florida who leans Republican, said a President Hillary Clinton is 'just going to continue a lot of things Obama has been doing.' 'There hasn't been much good in Obama's foreign policy,' Benton added. She called Clinton 'grizzled' from a life in politics and said that 'just because she's a woman doesn't mean she should be president.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . THE COLLEGE ON THE HILL: Dartmouth is the only Ivy Leage school in an early presidential primary state, making it an intellectual hotspot for candidates looking to read the younger generation's tea leaves . HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE! Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is in the Granite State this week for her first swing since declaring her candidacy for the White House . Twenty-two of the 50 Dartmouth students interviewed on Sunday mentioned the deadly 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya as a black mark on Clinton's record. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online, referring to Clinton's handling of an Islamist terror group's military-style assault that laid waste to a State Department facility. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' Like most of his classmates, Poole was born during Bill Clinton's second term as president. Team Hillary is carefully cultivating his generation's progressives and moderates, emphasizing her grandmotherly listening skills while papering over her liabilities. Poole said he knows why Clinton isn't emphasizing her eight years as a presidential spouse. 'It almost seems like she tried to use the position of first lady to nudge her way into possessing political power,' he mused, dropping hints about her 'Hillarycare' medical insurance overhaul proposal. 'But I wasn't too old at the time.' New Hampshire election law allows college students to choose whether to register to vote at home or at school. Many of the students Daily Mail Online spoek with said they hadn't decided yet; but all of those wh ohad made up their mind said they would vote in the Granite State. POLITICAL CROSSROADS: Hanover, New Hampshire is a frequent presidential primary debate site, hosting Democrats in 2007 and Republicans (pictured) in 2011 . Most of the  students who said they would vote for Hillary Clinton said they have little knowledge of her history before she led the State Department. 'I don't know that much about her political baggage,' conceded San Mateo, California native Maya Poddar, 19. But she insisted that Clinton would make a strong candidate because of her support for liberal positions on social issues. 'I think it's ridiculous that we haven't progressed to the point in society where things like gay marriage aren't still questioned,' Poddar said. Other left-leaning students were lukewarm or directly hostile to Clinton. Dartmouth College government student Stacey Benton said of Clinton that\u00a0'just because she's a woman doesn't mean she should be president' Robin Jayaswal of Portland, Oregon, a budding economist, would say only that 'she definitely is one of the more qualified Democrats for the position.' Robert Stackhouse, a Fort Worth, Texas native, told Daily Mail Online that 'she doesn't look like that fantastic a candidate.' Stackhouse has few quibbles about Obama's foreign policy \u2013 'it was probably more positive than negative,' he said \u2013 but isn't reassured by the idea of one of his secretaries of state taking over the Oval Office. 'It seems like she wants the job more than she would be good at it,' said Stackhouse. Dartmouth, the only Ivy League school in an early presidential primary state, is picture-postcard-beautiful but also isolated. Hanover, New Hampshire is 80 miles away from the nearest commercial airport and more than a two-hour drive from Boston. So political discussions happen in a vacuum. 'We're in a bubble here,' one student nearing graduation told Daily Mail Online during a Sunday full of interviews in dining halls, academic study lounges and dorm rooms. The entire Granite State is in some ways a closed information ecosystem, built half of Boston exurbs and half of towns best described as small, smaller and smallest. Manchester, the state's biggest city, has a population that barely ticks above 100,000. Fully 70 per cent of New Hampshire towns are home to fewer than 5,000. But the first-in-the-nation primary state's voters wield enormous influence every four years, and Dartmouth is their intellectual center of gravity. Clinton is visiting New Hampshire on Monday and Tuesday for the first time since she launched her presidential campaign online a week ago. A LIFETIME AGO: Hillary Clinton was first lady from 1993 to 2001, years when today's Dartmouth College undergraduates were born . OUTSIZE INFLUENCE: Dartmouth sits in a town of 11,000 and remains both the northernmost and the smallest of the eight famed Ivy League universities . Her organization's first seven days afloat were an experiment in rebranding a four-decades political veteran as a grinning grandma tuned in to the concerns of average voters. It's a farcical ploy that just might work, according to Julia Lau, a Dartmouth economics major from Honolulu, Hawaii. 'Her life has always been in the spotlight,' said Lau. 'I think that's why it's really interesting that she tried to go with this \"everyday American\" campaign.' 'Everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday American.' Lau said if Clinton is the Democrats' nominee, she would more likely than not vote for her anyway. 'Any attempt at trying to reach out to the everyday citizen is always going to be a good thing ... whether it's just for show or if it's actually genuine,' Lau said. A young woman seated next to her in a campus cafeteria listened intently and summed up the philosophy: 'Fake it 'til you make it.' Answers to two questions about Clinton seem to unite Dartmouth students: Neither her age nor her sex matters much to today's collegiate elites. Clinton would be the second-oldest U.S. president, and 'people are going to bring up her age, but that doesn't really matter,' said\u00a0Kevin Muzzi, a Democratic-leaning upperclassman from Greenville, Mississippi who voted for President Obama in 2012. ONE-PERCENTER:\u00a0'Everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday American,' Dartmouth student Julia Lau said of Clinton . 'Age is not a huge factor for me,' added government student Alex Frye of New Albany, Ohio. 'And I hope gender is a non-factor. I think it should be a non-factor.' Jacob Cutler, a history major from Maryland, said, 'It may be a historic thing, but it shouldn't matter. I don't really care what the gender of the person is. It's whether their ideas are good.' That's the problem, Cutler added. 'She obviously has a lot of experience in a lot of ways, but what might keep her from winning is what she did with that experience,' he said. 'Under Obama I really think we've made a lot of mistakes' with foreign policy, he explained, 'and some [were] under her tenure.' 'I don't know what she would do to change things. I think that's for her to clear up.' It's early in the 2016 race, and for every student who talked with Daily Mail Online another two said they wouldn't start paying close attention until the fall. In October 2011 Dartmouth hosted a memorable Republican primary debate that included now-forgotten names like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. Four years earlier it was the Democratic Party that took over Hanover for a day, back when Barack Obama was just finding his voice. Maryland native Jacob Cutler, pictured with unofficial Dartmouth mascot 'Keggy,' said electing the first female president 'may be a historic thing, but it shouldn't matter. I don't really care what the gender of the person is' But sometimes lightning in New Hampshire can strike early. It was in May 1987 \u2013 almost as early in the cycle as today's candidates find themselves \u2013 when Sen. Gary Hart's campaign imploded during a press conference in the Hanover Inn, just steps from the Dartmouth College green. The pothole in his road to the White House was an affair with model Donna Rice. Their trysting spot: a boat named 'Monkey Business.' There's not a single Dartmouth undergraduate today who was alive then. 'Most of the things I know about her were during her time as secretary of state,' said Alex Frye, a government major from New Albany, Ohio. 'I don't know much about what she did as a senator, or before that.' 'It's hard for me to think of any particular accomplishments,' Frye told Daily Mail Online. 'I suppose \u2013 I know she visited the most countries of any secretary of state.' 'But when you see a bunch of messes abroad, you kind of think of who was \u2013 well, it falls under who was secretary of state at the time.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has \"global and irreversible brain damage,\" according to her grandmother. Though the 22-year-old is no longer in a medically induced coma, she remains unresponsive, Cissy Houston said in a statement Monday after visiting her granddaughter. \"Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me,\" Houston said. \"We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time.\" Houston's statement matched that from a source with knowledge of Brown's condition, who told CNN on Monday that she remained in the same neurological state she has been in for nearly three months. She does not respond to visitors or familiar voices, and her eyes do not follow a person around the room, the source told CNN. She also has a tracheostomy in her throat, the source said. The reports come two days after Brown's father, Bobby Brown, said his daughter's condition had improved. \"I can say today, Bobbi is awake. She's watching me,\" Brown told the audience at Dallas' Verizon Theatre. The audience cheered. In a statement Monday, an attorney for the Brown family said that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved but that the kind of life she will lead remains to be seen. \"Doctors have indicated that she will have a long life,\" attorney Christopher Brown said. \"However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process, and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.\" Who's who in the Bobbi Kristina Brown case? Bobby Brown was in an \"emotional state\" on stage when he made the remarks about his daughter being awake, according to the statement. \"She has made it out of ICU, opened her eyes and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard,\" said Bobby Brown's wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown.",

The finding was unveiled in a CBS News report by Susan Spencer on one such company that manufactures them, the Vermont-based Keurig Green Mountain. Speaking to Spencer, Keurig's chief technology officer Kevin Sullivan explained the appeal of his company's single-serve coffee machine is that users can 'Just close the handle and touch a button, and away it goes.' Scroll down for video . Success: Keurig's chief technology officer Kevin Sullivan has said that single-serve coffee has 'found the hidden need - the need that people didn't know they had' Keurig Green Mountain's single-serve capsules in 2014 hit over $3 billion in US sales . CBS News\u00a0revealed that Keurig Green Mountain has proved highly successfully and made $4.7 billion in revenue. Among its many coffee flavors available, Keurig sells on its website Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Folgers, Dunkin Donuts and Kahlua options. Prices vary, but 24-counts of single-serve coffee capsules - often simply referred to as K-Cups - usually have list prices between $15.49 and $17.99, with members paying slightly less. 'Single serve, I think, found the hidden need - the need that people didn't know they had,' Sullivan said during the interview. 1/3 of homes in the United States now feature single-serve coffee machines, CBS News reported. Spencer said in the interview 'A cup of coffee made this way is not necessarily cheap.' Sullivan answered 'It's less expensive than if you go to a coffee shop, but it's more expensive than if you bought a pound of coffee and did your drip grind.'

Science: Keurig employees are seen with coffee equipment at the company's offices . At one point in the interview, Spencer posed the question 'So where is Keurig now in terms of making these things recyclable?' 'We've been hard at work to solve that problem,' Sullivan answered. 'We introduced a system called Vue that has cups that are, in fact, recyclable. 'We have a company objective that everything will be recyclable by the year 2020. We certainly aren't going to wait that long. I think we're going to start that much sooner, and hopefully convert sooner than that.' Keurig has said\u00a0on its website that a new type of K-Cup is being created, and that 'we intend to move toward polypropylene (#5) plastic for the cup itself \u2014 a material often used in common household items, such as yogurt and butter containers.' The company said the material 'is [...] accepted by recyclers in approximately 60% of communities in the United States and 93% of communities in Canada.' According to Keurig, the company is 'working with the recycling community and other partners to develop a more robust recycling infrastructure that accepts #5 plastics in even more communities and that can consistently capture small items, such as our portion packs.'",

        "article": "A farmer has been forced out of her home after a neighbour repeatedly exposed himself to her. Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by 67-year-old Kenneth Ward, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. Farmer Mandy Dunford, 54 (right), feels forced to leave her home after neighbour Kenneth Ward, 67 (left), who was jailed for exposing himself to her in 2011, was released from prison and allowed to return to his home . Police had discovered of a cache of weapons, including machine guns, in his home. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But while the former police officer believed her nine-year ordeal of harassment was over, Ward has now been released \u2013 and has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned. It means he will be able to return to his cottage next door to Miss Dunford\u2019s farm in Chop Gate, North Yorkshire. As a result, she said she feels forced to leave. \u2018I feel yet again that the offender has been given more rights than the victim,\u2019 the farmer said. \u2018My punishment for his crimes has been far worse than anything he has ever faced \u2013 I\u2019m losing my home so that he can return to his \u2026 I expected to live here for the rest of my life with my animals around me.\u2019 In a hearing held since Ward\u2019s sentencing, a new boundary was drawn up allowing him to approach Miss Dunford\u2019s farm from all sides. She added: \u2018It means he can follow me around with only the width of a wire fence between us. \u2018When I heard the order had been changed \u2026 I was horrified and I knew my only option was to pack up and leave. I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return \u2026 I can\u2019t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.\u2019 Miss Dunford\u2019s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. However, he has now been released and allowed to return home . She said: \u2018He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. \u2018He\u2019d run around the house at night shouting and tapping on the windows \u2026 he\u2019d come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks. \u2018Sometimes he\u2019d climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off \u2026 I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.\u2019 Ward and his brother also left piles of maggot-infested animal carcasses outside her home. Police finally arrested him after Miss Dunford filmed the harassment and showed them hours of footage.",

        "article": "The future of Andy Murray\u2019s coaching arrangement with Amelie Mauresmo looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after Wimbledon. Mauresmo, who is expecting a baby in August, will be replaced by Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the lead-up to the US Open and quite possibly after that, depending on how she assesses her priorities. The 27-year-old Scot, who is in Munich for this week\u2019s BMW Open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the Iphitos Tennis Club on Monday night, parted company with Ivan Lendl last year because the Czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling.

Murray (left) and coach Jonas Bjorkman enjoy the celebrations in Munich on Monday evening . Murray (left) arrives at the party alongside German sports manager Michael Mronz . Murray (right) poses for a picture alongside WBO Super Middleweight champion Arthur Abraham . Murray made it clear that if the responsibilities of parenthood prevent Mauresmo from fulfilling her 26-week commitment, then their relationship may have to go the same way. \u2018Right now Amelie does all the major competitions but if she doesn\u2019t want to do loads of time, I don\u2019t find it beneficial if someone just comes in for the major competitions and doesn\u2019t do any of the training, any of the other events,\u2019 Murray said. The plan is for Mauresmo to work with him up until Wimbledon, although by then she will be in the latter stages of pregnancy. Murray originally considered Bjorkman as a replacement for Lendl so if their current trial works well, it is likely he will take a more significant role than as an assistant to Mauresmo. It quickly became clear to Murray that the respected Swede might be used in an increased capacity after Mauresmo told him in February that, eight months after they had formalised their agreement, she was expecting \u2014 initially saying she had \u2018something personal\u2019 to tell him. \u2018I thought, \u201cSomething personal to tell you?\u201d I thought maybe she\u2019s pregnant,\u2019 Murray said. \u2018She normally goes to the gym all the time but she didn\u2019t train once through Australia. When she told me, it was a bit of a surprise. But because she\u2019d pre-warned me I kind of expected it a little bit.\u2019 Murray and Mauresmo look likely to part ways when his coach gives birth later on in the year . Jonas Bjorkmann (left) will work with Murray until the end of the US Open and then maybe longer . Mauresmo is not in Munich this week for Murray\u2019s first tournament on the clay since he got married. So far everything with Bjorkman has been satisfactory and he joined them in Barcelona last week at a training camp. \u2018He\u2019s easy going but as a player he was mentally very strong and had a great work ethic,\u2019 Murray said. \u2018I see him as being a good fit personality-wise but you don\u2019t really get the whole package until you\u2019re playing matches and there\u2019s a bit more pressure and stress. I wouldn\u2019t imagine it would be too much of a problem for him.\u2019 Although wearing a wedding ring, Murray will be taking it off when he plays. \u2018I can\u2019t play with it holding the racket because it gives me blisters,\u2019 he said. After Munich, Murray is playing Masters level events in Madrid and Rome before heading to the French Open in Paris. Murray trains ahead of the\u00a0BMW Open in Munich where he looks to pick up some wins on clay .",

        "article": "(CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" and defines as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus.\" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if \"necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,\" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,\" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes \"will be many state laws.\" \"This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,\" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. \"This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,\" she said. \"We'll continue to fight!\" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Jameela\u00a0spent \u00a33,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent \u00a33,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of\u00a0fillings in\u00a0the average\u00a0adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly. Jameela is supporting Allergy UK to raise awareness of food allergies and is ambassador for Holland & Barrett\u2019s Free From range .",

A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

        "article": "Ask Manny Pacquiao why he believes boxing to be the greatest sport of all and there is no mention of the $120 million or more he will be paid for going toe-to-toe with Floyd Mayweather in the most lucrative fist fight in history. Rather, his mind goes back to when the PacMan was the PacKid, a 12-year-old urchin in the mud of the Philippines whose mother was eking out the food for the family. \u2018Somebody told me and my friends some fights were being put on in the town,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018I did not know what boxing was but they said they you got a prize whatever the result. Two hundred pesos (two dollars) to win, a hundred to lose.\u2019 Manny Pacquiao was the star attraction as he held an open workout in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Pacquiao was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the gathered crowd at the Wild Card gym . Pacquiao addressed gathered media and talked about his upcoming May 2 fight with Floyd Mayweather . Pacquaio opened up about his motivation, his belief in God and journey to the top in boxing . Pacquaio works out in the ring in front of the world's media . Pacquiao does some pad work with trainer Freddie Roach . Pacquiao held an open training session at the Wild Card gym in Hollywood . The Filipino star works on his body shots with Roach . 'So we went and I won. I took the two dollars home and gave them to my mother so she could put more food on the table. But when she asked where I got the money I didn\u2019t tell her it was for fighting. \u2018We went back every Sunday and I kept winning the two dollars. Then my uncle came with a stack of videos and I watched Ali and Foreman and Holyfield and so many others.\u2019 And so it began. \u2018Boxing is the best sport because it teaches you about life,\u2019 he says. \u2018It taught me you will receive if you give back.\u2019 It is a lesson he wants to pass on to Mayweather. \u2018When this fight is finished I would like us to sit down quietly together to talk,\u2019 says Pacquiao. \u2018I want to speak to him about the Gospel of the Lord and how everything we get is a gift from God. How we are the stewards of this blessing and should use it for good.\u2019 Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) do some padwork as the media gather to watch . Pacquiao showed off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble Mayweather . Pacquiao looked calm and content as he went through his stretching and warm-up routine . Pacquiao and Roach take a break from the workout as they prepare for the biggest fight of their lives . Twenty-four hours earlier the equivalent story told by Mayweather was of how he told those close to him that he would become the first boxer to earn more than a hundred million bucks in a night. And since he is reputed to spend his fortunes on fast cars, fast living and fast women, this may seem an unlikely post-fight reunion. But the PacMan smooths the way to the Money Man by saying: \u2018Floyd deserves his money because he\u2019s earned it. He has the right to use it his way. But I would like to tell him how good it feels to help people who need it, like giving them plots of land and the houses they build on them.\u2019 Pacquiao\u2019s generosity to his impoverished countrymen is as legendary as Mayweather\u2019s excesses, although it should be stressed that Floyd Jnr is a charitable benefactor himself. But there is a difference, also, in their view of their craft. Mayweather admits that he has fallen out of love with boxing and regards it now as a business. Pacquiao says: \u2018Boxing is still my passion. I do it to please the fans, to give them excitement in return for their support. Not for the money. I am not a materialist. Pacquiao started to warm-up in front of the gathered crowd after first speaking to the media (right) Pacquiao opened up about his journey from fighting in the Philippines to the richest boxing bout in history . Pacquiao says he wants to entertain the fans and has warned Mayweather that his killer instinct is back . \u2018Now we have one of the biggest fights in history. But it\u2019s not about how much we will be paid. Whether it\u2019s two dollars or a hundred million dollars - it\u2019s what you do with it.\u2019 Mayweather suspects that Pacquiao\u2019sl determination to give the fans their money\u2019s worth \u2013 especially when they will be forking out huge amounts in Las Vegas on May to watch their Fight of the Century \u2013 may be his downfall. He describes Pacquiao as a reckless fighter, citing his shocking KO by Juan Manuel Marquez as proof. The PacMan responds: \u2018We would be nothing without the fans and this fight would not be so big. So we should entertain them. Yes, sometimes there is a price to pay, but it is worth it.\u2019 There is method to what Mayweather regards as madness. Floyd Jnr morphed into Mr Money by virtue of one of the most clever defences ever erected in the prize-ring. PacMan says: \u2018Boxing is about punching.\u2019 Pacquiao's trainer Roach was also much sought after at the Wild Card gym in Los Angeles . Roach had concerns that Pacquiao led too busy a lifestyle and it was previously affecting his performances . He would like to draw his rival as the best pound-for-pound boxer into an open fight: \u2018If he comes to try to knock me out it would be good for me. We\u2019ll see. \u2018But whatever happens it should be a better fight than five years ago, when everyone says it should have happened. We are fully developed as fighters and the world is watching now.\u2019 Mayweather keeps insisting it is \u2018just another fight.\u2019 Pacquiao says: \u2018I\u2019m excited. I love it. No, this fight will not define my career. That is done by all my accomplishments in becoming the only eight-division world champion. But winning this will be a big additional achievement for my legacy,\u2019 He did bridle when Mayweather\u2019s Money Team insinuated that he had risen through the weights with the help of chemical substances, which was why he challenged his opponent that if one of them tested positive for drugs that man should pay the other $5 million. It was an offer Mayweather refused. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum talks to the media ahead of the fight with Mayweather in May . But perhaps, naturally charming though he is and endlessly obliging to all and sundry, a little of that resentment is driving him on. His trainer Freddie Roach had been concerned that in rediscovering God and purifying his life-style he may have lost some of his bite \u2013 and hence the drop in knock-out ratio. Pacquiao says; \u2018My determination to win has never been higher than for this fight. My killer instinct is back.\u2019 At this very moment his pet Jack Russell terrier, also called PacMan and who accompanies him everywhere including the gym, barks. Loudly enough to be heard above the frenzied clamour of his master\u2019s media day at Roach\u2019s iconic Wild Card gym in West Hollywood. Pacquiao grins: \u2018It\u2019s nothing personal with Mayweather. We are just fighting for many things.\u2019 Floyd Mayweather hit the pads with uncle Roger during a media workout at his Las Vegas gym on Tuesday . Mayweather revealed he is no longer enjoying his boxing and sees the sport more as a business now . Mayweather works to the body with co-trainer Nate Jones in front of a huge crowd at his gym . There is no re-match clause in the contract and Mayweather has expressed no appetite for there to be a second fight. But for Pacquiao one good reason would be for him to even up split of the gigantic purse. \u2018I am not happy to have conceded 60-40 per cent to Floyd,\u2019 he says. \u2018Negotiating would be easier for the re-match. To make this happen we had to give him everything he wanted. If there is a next time it would be a different deal. \u2018Not for me. For my people. I cannot see anyone going hungry and not help them.\u2019 Once again, his mind is taking him back 24 years to the Philippines and those two-dollar fights.",

        "article": "Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . Three British planespotters who have spent two months in prison in the United Arab Emirates after they were arrested on national security grounds have been released. Conrad Clitheroe, 54 and Gary Cooper, 45, from Stockport, along with their ex-pat friend Neil Munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport. They were taken to a police station and, despite being told they would not be detained, were put into prison. Clitheroe's wife Valerie had written to British Prime Minister David Cameron to ask him to intervene in the case, raising concerns about her husband's health due to his heart murmur and high blood pressure. They were finally told earlier this week that they could return home after charges of espionage would not be brought against them. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the release of three British nationals detained in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates on February 21. 'We are providing consular assistance.' Attorney Nasser Hashem previously said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent. Mr Clitheroe will now be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife  on May 9. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Clitheroe said: 'I am absolutely ecstatic. Apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life. 'I just can't wait to see him, to hug him, to hold him. 'We got a call from the lawyer to tell us he'd been in court\u00a0and the case had been dropped. 'We then confirmed it with the consulate. 'I am just so happy, we've been ringing everyone to let them now. I'm in a bit of shock too, I don't feel like it can be real. 'How can you hold someone for that long with no charges? I don't understand it but I'm so so glad.' Earlier this month, Mrs Clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication. Valerie Clitheroe (pictured with her husband) said both he and Mr Cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release . The men had travelled to Dubai for a four-day holiday on February 18.\u00a0All three friends were keen to see Fujairah Airport, which is used by older and rarer aircraft. They drove the 70-mile journey there on February 21, but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes. Mr Clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs. Although plane spotting is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, it is not understood and is frowned upon. The men were taken to a police station, where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in Arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again. But after signing the document, without asking for a translation, they were kept in custody overnight. They were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to Fujairah Prison. Mr Clitheroe posted this picture on February 19 as he pursued his hobby at the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai . Their case was escalated to a matter of 'national security'. Sharing a cell with over 20 others, eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day, the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as Mr Clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition. A judge last month extended their custody licence, which was up again on April 12, but an admin error delayed the hearing until this week. Mrs Clitheroe added: 'Conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released. 'Things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly. The men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport . 'We thought they would be charged with something and fined so it's come as a shock that there are no charges at all. We had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face.' Mrs Clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children. The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper were helped by charity\u00a0'Detained in Dubai' to pay \u00a39,000 for a lawyer to fight their case. A crowd-funding site set up by the men's work colleagues has raised more than \u00a35,000. Earlier this week, Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. 'The charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties. They've had a long time to wait to be told your case is ridiculous,' said Ms Stirling.",

        "article": "The wife of a Detroit-area soccer referee filed a $51 million lawsuit Friday against a hot-headed player who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. The figure represents $1 million for each of the 51 additional years that John Bieniewicz, 44, could have lived, according to the lawsuit in Wayne County court. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer . Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter . The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad . 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz testified at Michigan's Capitol earlier this year in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees \u2018are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' Mrs Bieniewicz said that through everything, her only consolation has been the thought that her husband died doing something he loved.",

        "article": "(CNN)After deliberating for more than 35 hours over parts of seven days, listening intently to the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and reviewing more than 400 pieces of evidence, the teary-eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces. Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez . Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all. It's just very serious,\" Carlson said. 5 things to know about the jury .",

A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a \u00a310 note. Bradley Dew, 26, had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile. But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend's home, claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay. As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend, Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face. He then stole \u00a310 out of his wallet. Dew, of Faversham, then fled the scene, and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's home hours later on March 29 last year. Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home. Dew denied stealing from his friend, and told officers it would have been 'like robbing my brother.' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault, following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle, of Kent Police, said: 'Dew took advantage of a so-called friend's generosity, taking his phone and then never returning it. 'He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet. 'He did all of this in the victim's own home, which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety. 'Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day, but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend.' Dew, 26, was found guilty of robbery and assault by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured)",

        "article": "Another trophy slipped through Brendan Rodgers\u2019 grip when they lost to Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday. That elusive first piece of silverware is proving hard to attain and an itch is developing which is in dire need of being scratched. After spending more than \u00a3200million since taking charge at Liverpool in June 2012, there is only so long the owners and fans will keep patient in their desire for dividends. Brendan Rodgers gives instructions to Steven Gerrard during Liverpool's defeat against Aston Villa . Rodgers is set for his third season without a trophy after Liverpool were dumped out of the FA Cup . Twitching times can develop when the top clubs go through barren spells - and Rodgers\u2019 is beginning to enter such a period. During Rodgers\u2019 time in charge, Manchester United and Chelsea had spent more than their Merseyside rivals - so too have City by a fraction - but each of those have brought home something. United and City have won two trophies - including the Premier League title - while Chelsea have one and are sure to add the league title to that soon. Arsene Wenger has spent \u00a3183m, comparatively little, but managed to win two trophies over the past two seasons. That is less than rivals Tottenham, who have spent just under \u00a3200m and, like Liverpool, have won nothing. Alexis Sanchez celebrates his extra-time winner against Reading to seal Arsenal's spot in the FA Cup final . Eden Hazard's first-half strike against Manchester United leaves Chelsea on the brink of winning the title . While the country\u2019s best teams are filling their trophy cabinets, Rodgers\u2019 remains bare. The Red half of Merseyside expect success and landed the League Cup under Kenny Dalglish just before Rodgers took to the helm. Analysis by Sportsmail indicates that he has signed 22 players during his tenure, but only seven of those can be considered a success at this current time. His top signings have been Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Simon Mignolet, but the poor transfers outweigh the successful ones. Rogers has gone for top young talent, ranging from 18 to 21 when he signs them. There is still time for some of those players - the likes of Joao Teixeira and Divock Origi - to prove their worth. But there will be only so much time. Many of his big-money failures came last summer, when he tried to spend the money accrued from selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona for \u00a375m. Adam Lallana, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Balotelli have all disappointed this term. Like the younger potentials, each of those could still make their mark, but the question is if it does not come together next season - and they remain trophyless again - will Rogers still be in charge to reap any of the rewards? Philippe Coutinho, Mario Balotelli and Jordan Henderson reflect on Liverpool's semi-final defeat on Sunday . Summer 2012 . Fabio Borini, Roma, \u00a310.5m . Farmed out to Sunderland for the whole of last season on loan then failed to secure a move away from Liverpool but has scored just once this season as a bit-part player. VERDICT: MISS . Joe Allen, Swansea, \u00a315m . One of Rodgers\u2019 first signings after he raided his former club. The plucky midfielder has not been spectacular so far but has still been a solid acquisition. VERDICT: HIT . Fabio Borini, pictured in action against Newcastle earlier this month, has scored just one goal for Liverpool . Joe Allen tackles Christian Benteke in Liverpool's defeat; he has proved to be one of Rodgers' best buys . Oussama Assaidi, Heerenveen, \u00a32.4m . Failed to make a Premier League start at Liverpool, having more joy in two loan spells at Stoke, and was sold to Al Ahli in January. VERDICT: MISS . Samed Yesil, Bayer Leverkusen, \u00a31m . Still only 20, this signing could well come to fruition at a later stage, especially if some of his performances for the club's Under-21 side are anything to go by. But has made only two appearances for the first team, both in the League Cup. VERDICT: MISS . January 2013 . Daniel Sturridge, Chelsea, \u00a312m . Who says January transfers never work? Went on to score 11 goals in 16 Liverpool games in the second half of the season after signing and has become one of Europe\u2019s top strikers. VERDICT: HIT . Philippe Coutinho, Inter Milan, \u00a38.5m . What a snip \u00a38.5m looks after the Brazilian, still only 22, has become one of the league\u2019s best players. VERDICT: HIT . Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, both signed in January 2013, must be considered 'hits' for Liverpool . Summer 2013 . Luis Alberto, Sevilla, \u00a36.8m . The 22-year-old is currently on loan at Malaga after failing to break into Liverpool\u2019s first team and is yet to start a league match for them. VERDICT: MISS . Iago Aspas, Celta Vigo, \u00a37.2m . Strikers are judged on their goals and Aspas, now on loan at Sevilla, has scored only one of those for Liverpool in an FA Cup match. VERDICT: MISS . Simon Mignolet, Sunderland, \u00a39m . Been through some shaky spells but when on form, which he is at the moment, he is one of the Premier League\u2019s best goalkeepers. VERDICT: HIT . Simon Mignolet has endured some shaky spells at Liverpool, but when in form, he is one of the league's best . Joao Teixeira, Sporting Lisbon, \u00a3800,000 . The 22-year-old has performed well on loan at Brighton this season and time will tell if he can break into Liverpool\u2019s first team, but he has to be deemed a \u2018miss' after only one substitute appearance so far. VERDICT: MISS . Kolo Toure, Man City, free . At 34, he is no longer one of the greatest centre-backs in the league but is by no means one of the worst and signing him on a free transfer was a shrewd piece of business. VERDICT: HIT . Mamadou Sakho cost Liverpool \u00a318m and has failed to justify his price tag, while Kolo Toure joined on a free . Mamadou Sakho, Paris Saint-Germain, \u00a318m . Can be a formidable central defender at times but is far too erratic to justify the \u00a318m price tag. VERDICT: MISS . Tiago Ilori, Sporting Lisbon, \u00a37m . Yet to play for Liverpool and the defender has managed only a few appearances on loan at Granada and now Bordeaux. Only 22, but is running out of time to prove himself. VERDICT: MISS . Summer 2014 . Kevin Stewart, Tottenham, free . Another who could well become a \u2018hit\u2019 in the future, but cannot be considered one right now with the 21-year-old not appearing for Liverpool. On loan at Burton. VERDICT: MISS . Rickie Lambert, Southampton, \u00a34m . It felt like he was joining the club as a back-up player, but injury to Sturridge and lack of form from Mario Balotelli thrust Lambert into the spotlight and he has been unable to deliver. VERDICT: MISS . Rickie Lambert, replacing Raheem Sterling in Liverpool's win over Newcastle, is a bit-part player at Anfield . Adam Lallana, Southampton, \u00a325m . Lallana has admitted he is yet to repay the Liverpool fans for his hefty price tag and has been well short of his commanding displays for Southampton in recent seasons. VERDICT: MISS . Emre Can, Bayer Leverkusen, \u00a310m . Rodgers appears to be moulding Can into a centre-back  and at 21 he has played with a mature head that belies his tender years. VERDICT: HIT . Lazar Markovic, Benfica, \u00a320m . The Serbian has been at times brilliant but has failed to produce that form on a regular basis and at \u00a320m fans will be expecting far more. VERDICT: MISS . Emre Can\u00a0has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from Bayer Leverkusen . LIVERPOOL . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3215.7m . TROPHIES WON: 0 . CHELSEA . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3277.3m . TROPHIES WON: Capital One Cup . MANCHESTER UNITED . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3267.5m . TROPHIES WON: Premier League, Community Shield . MANCHESTER CITY . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3217.4m . TROPHIES WON: Premier League, Capital One Cup . TOTTENHAM . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3199.7m . TROPHIES WON: 0 . ARSENAL . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: \u00a3183m . TROPHIES WON: FA Cup, Community Shield . Dejan Lovren, Southampton, \u00a320m . Another former Southampton player who turned in a number of consummate displays on the south coast but has failed to replicate them in Merseyside. Become an error-prone player since his move. VERDICT: MISS . Divock Origi, Lille, \u00a310m . The Belgian is only considered a \u2018miss\u2019 due to not playing for Liverpool, but if he can replicate his form on loan at Lille when he returns, Rodgers could have a frightening forward at his disposal. Still only 20. VERDICT: MISS . Alberto Moreno, Sevilla, \u00a312m . Been an ever-present at full-back in Liverpool\u2019s side this season; strong, fast and direct going forward and is not bad at defending as well. VERDICT: HIT . Mario Balotelli, AC Milan, \u00a316m . His off-field problems outweigh his one goal in the league and three in other competitions. The controversial Italian has mustered all season. Rodgers needed a stellar name to replace Luis Suarez up front and Balotelli has not been that. VERDICT: MISS . HITS: 7 . MISSES: 15 .",

        "article": "A British former supermarket security guard, who left his parents house and became an ISIS jihadist in Syria, has been busy writing advice about  'dealing' with wannabe jihadi brides. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, first came to prominence when he appeared in a ISIS propaganda video, urging the West to send troops to fight ISIS, vowing 'we'll send them back one by one in coffins.' Now the fighter has been promoting himself as an amateur Islamic thinker, regularly attempting to write about daily issues faced by jihadists. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, used to live at home with his mother and work as a security guard at Morrisons before he travelled to Syria. Entitled 'Dealing with sisters and social media', the lazy fighter dishes out his best advice for handling the ladies. The fighter, who still hasn't managed to find himself a jihadi bride, encourages fighters not to be disheartened by the other fighters who get married via social media. The extremist warns of jihadi brides becoming jealous of other women liking their husband's social media account too much. He wrote: 'No pious sister would be pleased to see her husband getting so many likes from other sisters. Not to mention how glamorous some of these niqabi sisters try to look in their poses of their profile pics. The 27-year-old claimed: 'Even a simple word of praise from a sister online can damage your intention. Always keep yourself in check.' Hussain initially joined Jabhat al-Nusra but switched to ISIS after just four months. He spends most of his time writing and taking photographs from his home in Raqqa, Syria. Creepy jihadi Omar Hussain also has a cat, known as Lucy, whom he adopted from the streets. The bachelor has been keen to dish out advice on securing jihadi brides. When he is not furiously trying to write advice about Islam, Hussain seems to enjoy eating plenty of unhealthy snacks and attempting to cook. The hapless self styled hitch wrote: 'You may see some brothers with so many sisters following them, with sisters praising them, writing on their page etc. But just ignore the temptations.' Hussain also describes women as 'the adornment of this world, and man is constantly tempted to seek a woman's attention.' Whilst he loves giving out advice on social media, Hussain appears to struggle with life outside the cyber world. Unable to fight, Hussain finds even the most basic tasks in life difficult and even recently admitted it\u00a0took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. The failed fighter wrote: 'Life can't go on like this, I need a Sabi (servant) :(' He confessed that he had to cut up the potatoes the next morning after tiring himself out with the peeling process. Unable to fight, Hussain finds even the most basic tasks in life difficult and even admitted it even took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. The fighter recently claimed he had been a terror camp trainer whilst he was with Jabhat al-Nusra. He also posted a picture of a gym which he appears to have briefly visited. The calamitous jihadi initially joined the Al Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra, before switching to the more popular ISIS after just four months. Surprisingly, the fighter recently claimed he had been a terror camp trainer whilst he was with Jabhat al-Nusra. He wrote: 'Initially I was with Jabhat An-Nusrah, so all my training was done with them, and due to my physique at the time, I was appointed to stay in the training camp and train the new set of brothers.' Whilst it is difficult to verify Hussain's claims, it is possible that he was involved in the training of other fighters. Last August, Hussain appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Comedian Chris Rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police. He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: \"This one was on film.\" Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. \"Stopped by the cops again wish me luck,\" he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it \"driving while black.\" Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. \"My heart legit dropped, no kidding,\" one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to \"#Adapt\" to avoid racial profiling. \"I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police,\" Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. \"Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?.\" Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to \"excite a conversation.\" Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his \"Chris Rock\" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. \"Here's the crazy thing,\" Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. \"If you weren't here, I'd be scared.\"",

As has become tradition, the top of the iconic building in New York has turned green for the weekend to celebrate the start of Cosmos' North American Soccer League season, and the occasion was marked by two very special guests. Beckenbauer and Pele are two of the greatest footballers ever to have lived, and the pair played for New York Cosmos together in the late 1970s. As the former noted, they were pioneers at the time, bringing football to a territory that had rarely seen the game before. Franz Beckenbauer (left) and Pele (centre) were reunited in New York on Friday afternoon . The pair played for New York Cosmos in the 1970s, before the club went bankrupt in the following years . Speaking at the ceremony on Friday, Beckenbauer joked to Pele: 'Your English is better than 30 or 40 years ago when we played together. 'I told you once you were one of the reasons I signed for the New York Cosmos in the year of 1977. Pele, he came in 1975, and I think we were pioneers at the time because no-one here in the country played soccer.' Brazilian legend Pele, now 74, also had his say as the pair flicked the switch to turn on the lights. Pele (right) runs with the ball, while team-mate Beckenbauer watches on in the background . Ahead of the new season starting this weekend, the pair turned the Empire State Building green to celebrate . Pele and Beckenbauer joined hands at the top, and spoke of their pride at returning to New York . 'I thank God for this moment, for this help. And Beckenbauer, now my partner, is going to suffer together because the New York Cosmos come back but now we just stay on the bench. Congratulations, good luck to you.' Following success with Pele and Beckenbauer in the 70s, Cosmos went bankrupt and stopped playing in the 1980s, only returning in 2010 with Pele as the club's honorary president. They play in the second division of American soccer, kicking off their season with a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies on Saturday. Pele was asked whether he'd prefer Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Brazil legend chose Messi . Pele, regularly voted the best player of all time, says Ronaldo is 'more forward, more of a scorer' When lists of the greatest ever footballers are released, both Beckenbauer and Pele are familiar sights in the top 10. Nowadays, Messi v Ronaldo is the popular debate, and the Brazilian legend has had his say on modern football's messiahs. 'It's not that I like one of Messi or Cristiano more, when people ask me, I always say that you cannot compare them,' he told Al Primer Toque. 'Cristiano is a great player, more forward, more of a scorer. Messi is a player who makes goals but also creates chances as a weapon in behind. 'The two would be very important, but if I had to choose one it would be Messi.'",

The Black Cats are two places and three points above the drop zone but have won just one in nine and end their season with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. It has left them as odds-on with some bookmakers to finish inside the bottom three come May 24. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat has concerns about the physical strength of his players . Advocaat has never been relegated during 28 years as a manager but admits he is worried about that record having watched Sunderland slump to a 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday. Next up is a trip to Stoke City and the Dutch boss fears his team lacks the muscle for such a test. \u2018We are not a real physical team,\u2019 said the 67-year-old. \u2018If you compare us with the other teams, that\u2019s a big difference. \u2018In the Premier League, you need physical players as well. We have to think about that for the game with Stoke City.

        "article": "Carlos Tevez talks about being as free as a bird, back to the days when he was banging in the goals in Argentina for Boca Juniors. A big hit on the famous steeped terracing at La Bombonera as he followed in the footsteps of Diego Maradona, Claudio Cannigia and some of the other greats. Here in Turin he is worshipped at the Juventus Stadium, one of the idols in the shirt of the Bianconeri with that fearless, wholehearted approach to the game. Carlos Tevez (left) is worshipped by Juventus fans and has scored six Champions League goals this season . The Italian side are aiming to beat Monaco on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . On Tuesday evening, with six goals already in this season\u2019s Champions League, he will be expected to deliver in the first leg of the quarter-final against Monaco. Juve are already on course for the Serie A title, 12 points clear of nearest rivals Lazio ahead of their meeting in the league this weekend. First though, Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s team must find a way to beat Monaco, to secure a decent first-leg lead against the surprise quarter-finalists before the return in the Stade Louis II. At 31 Tevez appears to be enjoying his football again, helping Juventus to the title last season and leading the assault on the Champions League this term. Massimiliano Allegri is hoping to end 19 years of Champions League hurt by taking Juventus to glory . Monaco stand in Juventus' way; they were\u00a0adventurous and audacious in their win over Arsenal in the last 16 . It is easy to knock Italian football, to place it behind England, Spain and Germany, but to do that would do a great disservice to this Juventus team. There are some formidable talents in there, with Gianluigi Buffon protected in his goal by the tough, uncompromising presence of Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci in their three-man defence. The prolonged absence of Andrea Pirlo, who has made five appearances in this season\u2019s competition, has given others a chance to excel in the centre of this Juve midfield. Paul Pogba, one of the summer targets for Manchester United, is missing but Arturo Vidal, Roberto Pereyra and Claudio Marchisio all have pedigree. Tevez admits he feels free at Juventus, back to the days when he was playing for Boca Juniors (pictured) Monaco players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on the eve of their Champions League quarter-final . It has been 12 years since they last reached the Champions League final, when they were beaten by Milan on penalties during a dreadful stalemate that finished 0-0 at Old Trafford. For supporters of Juve it has been too long, with the shootout victory over Ajax in 1996 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome a distant memory. They have won the European Cup twice and would dearly love a third. Standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is Monaco, the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over Arsenal in the previous round. At the Emirates, Leonardo Jardim\u2019s team were adventurous and audacious, surprising Arsenal with their breathtaking approach to the game. They are not to be underestimated. Gianluca Vialli lifts the Champions League for Juventus in 1996 - the last time the Bianconeri were victorious . In 2003, Juventus suffered heartbreak in the Champions League final, losing to AC Milan in a penalty shootout . Despite the big, high-profile exits of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and Radamel Falcao\u2019s season-long loan to Manchester United, they are difficult to beat. Joao Moutinho is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the France international Jeremy Toulalan can always pick out a pass. Up front is Dimitar Berbatov, one of the scorers at the Emirates on the night of that incredible and climactic 3-1 victory in the first leg. Dimitar Berbatov is one of the men standing in Juventus' way in their Champions League quarter-final . Tevez is adored by Juventus supporters and they will hope he is the man to help them to European glory . It was after that game when Arsene Wenger headed straight for the tunnel, failing to shake the hand of Monaco\u2019s Portuguese coach following Arsenal\u2019s defeat. When Monaco scraped through on away goals, Jardim made a point of calling Wenger \u2018disrespectful\u2019 for his behaviour, which is familiar to all English football fans, on the touchline. Here in Turin, the Monaco coach talked of being worthy of their place in the quarter-final, good enough to live with the very best teams left in the tournament. Now, inside this magnificent new stadium, they get to meet one of them.",

Victory this season with Bayern, who face Porto in the quarter-finals starting Wednesday night at the Dragao, would make Alonso only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso admitted to The Telegraph. Xabi Alonso lines up for Bayern Munich on Wednesday night against Porto at the Dragao Stadium . The Champions League first leg quarter-final is the next step in his quest to win the title with three clubs . 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' Alonso said. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to be a pundit rather than a player for the final win over Atletico Madrid. Alonso trains under the watchful eye of manager Pep Guardiola who is keen to add to his Barcelona victories . Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Real Madrid and twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007. At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. But first his side must overcome Porto, who are the only unbeaten side in the competition this year.

        "article": "Many Californians are taking extreme measures to conserve water in the face of the state's historic drought. Water-conscious residents have turned to techniques that utilize so-called 'gray water' to help them meet the unprecedented new water-use restrictions imposed by Governor Jerry Brown last week. Those techniques may appear weird to some - like the toilet that doubles as a sink and used washing machine water used to water fruit trees - but these Californians maintain it's the inevitable future of water conservation. Extreme water saver: Robin Weld of Sacramento has installed a hybrid sink-toilet in response to\u00a0the unprecedented new water-use restrictions imposed by Governor Jerry Brown in the face of the state's historic drought. Clean water comes in through the faucet, is used to wash hands and then flows into the toilet tank to be used to flush . Robin Weld, who lives in parched Sacramento, recently took the step of converting her home's toilet into a toilet-sink. For $100, Weld purchased the sink positive, she told CBS Sacramento. It replaces the tradition lid to her toilet tank with a small hand sink. 'We're washing our hands and then reusing that water,' Weld said. Clean city water comes in through the faucet and then fills the tank instead of simply going to waste. On the next flush, the used hand sink water comes down into the bowl. 'The average person uses the bathroom what at least five times a day so that's five times a day, so that adds up,' she said. And just next door to Weld, her neighbor Chris Brown is using the left over water from his showers, laundry and other tasks to irrigate his yard. First, the 'gray water' goes through a filtration system that Brown had installed as the drought - now in its fifth year - continued to worsen. Gray water: Weld's neighbor Chris Brown collects all the soapy used water from this home's washing machine's, showers and sinks and uses it to irrigate trees and plants in his yard . A/C condensation: South of Weld and Brown, in the affluent LA neighborhood of Brentwood,\u00a0Scott Mathers, the owner of Hey! Tanks LA, has installed one of his company's 10,000-gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water. One place he gets water is from the condensate from his home a/c units . 'Every drop of water flows down to this pipe, runs underground now, down to the front yard, and then it's spread,' Brown explained to CBS Sacramento. To the south, a resident of Los Angeles' affluent Brentwood neighborhood is going to even bigger extremes to conserve precious moisture. Scott Mathers, the owner of Hey! Tanks LA, tells CBSLA he's installed one of his company's 10,000-gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water. One of the sources of the gray water: the condensation from his admittedly large home's air conditioning units. Mathers uses his gray water to, among other things, feed his horses. 'There are so many opportunities to harvest your water on your site,' he says. While they may appear to verge on the fanatical now, these conservationists believe what they are doing is the new normal for the Golden State. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, California\u2019s 2014 Water Year was the third driest in 119 years and the warmest on record, so perpetual wildfire season also appears to be the new normal. Gray water systems like Aqua2use filter a home's soapy water in order to make it usable for plants and lawns . And there\u2019s little relief on the horizon:\u00a0The National Weather Service\u2019s seasonal drought outlook predicts developing, persisting or intensifying drought conditions for most of the American West through at least the end of June. The Sierra Nevada snowpack is at 5 percent of normal, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1950. With the wet season over and with no major rainfall in the forecast, parched conditions will continue. The Sierra snowpack is a key element of California's water supply. About one-third of the state's water comes from snowpack that melts in the spring and summer, recharging groundwater and replenishing reservoirs. But with hardly any snow recorded during the last survey of the year, there will be little runoff to refill half-empty reservoirs. Many Southern California cities get their drinking water from the Colorado River basin, which supplies water to about 40 million people and 4 million acres of farmland in seven states. Brown's order called for investment in new water technologies and the streamlining of water projects such as desalination plants that turn ocean water into drinking water. Such facilities, however, are expensive to build. Unprecendented: Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday ordered sweeping and unprecedented measures to save water in California . No snow: Surveyors on Wednesday found the lowest snow level in the Sierra Nevada snowpack in 65 years of record-keeping, marking a fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow that California depends on to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs .",

Adriana Giogiosa, 55, was reported missing after her brother could not contact her at the house in Majadahonda, a suburb of Madrid, where she had been staying for the last two or three months. The landlord of the house, a 32-year-old Spanish man with a history of psychological problems, has been arrested. Adriana Giogiosa was reported missing by her brother after he was unable to contact her, and Ms Giogiosa's landlord in Madrid has been arrested in connection with her disappearance and a meat grinder found there . Spanish Police are said to have found blood and an industrial meat grinder at the property in a quiet street, as well as a list of three other tenants who are also thought to be missing. At least two of the other missing tenants are thought to be women from Argentina and the man's aunt has also not been found - prompting fears they could all have been murdered. When they searched the house in Sacedilla Street in Majadahonda officers found half of it had been repainted and the other half covered in plastic, ready for redecorating, El Pais reported. At first the man had refused officers access to the house and demanded they get a warrant. Spanish Police found a couple of spots of blood in the house, a meat grinder and what appeared to be a tooth in the machine. A blood stained knife was also found. These have all been sent off for analysis. Police launched an investigation after Miss Giogiosa's brother reported her missing on April 6. She had visited home in Argentina in February and caught a flight back to Madrid at the end of March, when she is believed to have been killed. Her brother said after he arrived back in Madrid he had received text messages from her saying she would be unable to speak because she was moving country and he had not been able to contact her - despite usually talking on a daily basis. The house in a quiet Majadahonda street has been searched by police, who reportedly found a meat grinder . A letter was also sent to Miss Giogiosa's work, a restaurant, saying she would not be returning for personal reasons after she returned to Madrid,\u00a0Periodista Digital reported. Officers are also searching nearby rubbish dumps in Pinto. Neighbours reported hearing loud noises and the landlord taking out bags of rubbish from the house in Sacedilla Street in Mjadahonda in the days before the landlord was arrested, according to La Nueva Espana.\u00a0There were also reports that the garage had been soundproofed. The man, who has previously been in a psychiatric hospital with schizophrenia, took over the house from his aunt when she reportedly went into a care home. Authorities are also trying to trace her. The brother of Miss Giogiosa has flown to Madrid to help with the investigation.",

        "article": "Roaming. The word suggests travelling with a worry-free, devil-may-care attitude. But in the world of mobile phones, where roaming means using your device abroad, that approach is unwise. Making calls, downloading emails and browsing the internet when in another country can result in very large bills. So how can you keep roaming costs down? The best option is to be with mobile operator Three. Its customers can call and text UK numbers and use data in some countries at no extra cost to their UK price plans. Three is the only operator to offer this arrangement, which it calls Feel At Home. Three's Feel at Home covers 18 destinations in Europe, Australia, the United States, Asia and the Middle East . In September 2013, when Three introduced Feel At Home, it covered seven destinations. I said then that to be a game-changer it needed to expand the service to more countries \u2013 and it has. With Spain and New Zealand added earlier this month, it now applies in 18 countries. In Europe, the deal also covers France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Elsewhere, it covers Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Israel. Given that Spain, France, Italy and the US are among the most popular destinations for Britons, Three claims that about two-thirds of its customers\u2019 overseas trips are now covered by Feel At Home. A word of warning. Three publicises Feel At Home by saying that it enables you to \u2018use your phone abroad at no extra cost\u2019. But to call or text non-UK numbers \u2013 imagine you are in Spain and you phone a restaurant in Barcelona \u2013 you will be charged extra, at roaming rates. However, these are much lower than other operators\u2019 standard rates in some countries \u2013 for example, 15.6p per minute to call local numbers in the US, Australia and New Zealand. There are some other caveats, too \u2013 one being you can\u2019t \u2018tether\u2019 (use your phone to connect another device to the internet). Check all details on three.co.uk/feelathome. Nonetheless, if you\u2019re travelling to a Feel At Home country, using Three is the most preferable option. When travelling, operators\u2019 bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates . Take roaming in New Zealand. On their standard rates for pay-monthly customers, rival operators charge up to \u00a31.50 a minute for making and receiving calls, 35p to 50p for sending a text, and up to \u00a38 per megabyte of data usage. In EU countries, roaming charges are much lower as they are capped. On operators\u2019 standard rates, you\u2019ll pay about 18p or 19p per minute to make a call, 5p per minute to receive a call, 5p to 6p to send a text and 20p per megabyte of data. If you\u2019re not with Three and are heading to a Feel At Home destination, operators\u2019 bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates \u2013 though it depends on your usage levels. To give one example, Vodafone lets you use your UK\u2019s plan allowance for calls, texts and data for \u00a33 a day in Europe, and \u00a35 a day in some countries further afield. However, you will need to actively sign up to get this deal. If you have an unlocked handset, you might consider investing in a local, country-specific SIM card: see 0044.co.uk, uk2abroad.com or dataroam.co.uk for details. Otherwise, stick to using free wi-fi in, for example, hotels and cafes, which will also enable you to chat for free if you have a Skype or Viber account.

To make matters worse the Irish rugby legend's wife Amy Huberman caught wind of the picture on social media, with hilarious consequences. O'Driscoll has been in Hong Kong this week working as an ambassador for HSBC ahead of the Hong Kong Sevens and clearly found time to unwind away from his commitments. Amy Huberman shares a joke with her husband in the Royal Box at Wimbledon last summer . The couple are pictured attending a Downing Street reception following the victorious 2013 Lions tour . On Monday, at home in Ireland, actress Huberman posted the picture of O'Driscoll and wrote: 'You know when your husband is away in Hong Kong on a very important business trip...' This was followed by a that read: 'I better get a giant Toblerone from the duty free.' Sure enough, O'Driscoll returned on Tuesday, tail between his legs with the requested Toblerone. Clearly taking some joy in her husband's embarrassment, Huberman later posted a picture of O'Driscoll holding the chocolate bar, declaring: 'He's home.' O'Driscoll may think twice before crowd surfing in future. The couple celebrates Ireland's Six Nations success in O'Driscoll's final international match in March 2014 .",

Coral Jones, 43, whose daughter was snatched from outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, had letters demanding her other children be taken into care. She was branded a 'bad mother' for allowing April to play in the street past 7pm where she was abducted and killed by paedophile Mark Bridger. Scroll down for video . Coral Jones, pictured with her husband, Paul, 46, has revealed she has been sent hate mail blaming her for the murder of her five-year-old daughter April and demanding her other children are taken into care . Mrs Jones said: 'We had a letter with no name on it and no address to write to, saying I was a bad mother and it was my fault and I shouldn't have my other children with me. 'Yes, I blame myself every day for it but unless they live in my shoes they have no right to tell me I am a bad mother.' She admitted that she blames herself for letting April stay out on her bike 'for an extra 15 minutes' after getting a good school report that day in October 2012. Bridger, 49, who took her to his cottage nearby and killed her, was jailed for life in 2013 but despite the largest police search in British history her body has never been recovered. April Jones, left, was abducted from outside her home by Mark Bridger, right, who was jailed for life in 2013 . Mrs Jones and husband Paul, 46, told BBC Wales programme Week In Week Out they have battled to live a normal life for their two children Jazmin, 19, and Harley, 12, after the tragedy. Since the loss of her daughter, Mrs Jones has suffered from agroraphobia and will not leave the house on her own. Mr Jones said: 'It is not often she will go anywhere on her own. Even just to pop down the shops one of the kids will go with her or I will go with her or she will call a friend.' Mrs Jones added: 'I get frightened and feel unsafe that people come up to me. I know they mean no harm but when people come up to me and I am feeling frightened, I can't cope.' She admitted that the only place in her town she feels comfortable is April's favourite local sweet shop. 'He [Bridger] didn't just take April away from us - he took her away from the town,' she said. 'I shouldn't be like this because of him but I cannot help it.' April's older sister Jazmin explained her family were still struggling to come to terms with her murder. The family has said they have struggled to come to terms with April's death. Coral and Paul Jones are pictured with their eldest daughter, Jazmin, 19, (left) and 13-year-old Harley (second left) She said: 'One day I could be really happy and Dad could be really upset and we would argue, we would shout at each other. We would want to hit someone or something just to get the anger out.' The Jones' have launched a campaign to highlight the growing problem of internet abuse after their daughter's killer was found to have accessed child abuse images online hours before her death. Mr Jones told the BBC he thought part of preventing the issue rested with potential offenders, who should identify themselves to authorities to get support. He said: 'If you have got the notion that you like kids like that or anything like that, if you go and ask for help then you deserve a chance.\u00a0But if you don't ask for help and you commit a crime then you are a paedophile.' Last year, the Jones family joined Madeleine McCann's parents, Gerry and Kate, to back the nationwide Child Rescue Alert with the charity Missing People.",

The new collagen-laced brew, created by Japanese liquor company Suntory, boasts a five per cent alcohol content level and claims to have two grams of collagen per can. Scroll down for video . A new collagen-laced brew, created by Japanese liquor company Suntory, boasts a five per cent alcohol content level and claims to have two grams of collagen per can . Collagen is a type of protein found in skin that provides structure, firmness and texture, making people appear more youthful. As it gets older, the body\u2019s reserves of collagen deplete, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles . Collagen supplements have become popular in recent years claiming to offer the ultimate anti-aging cure. But before cancel the gym for a night out, Rocketnews24 says the beer is currently on available in Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido. The company has yet to reveal how effective the beer has been in trials, or how much it costs. This isn\u2019t the first time Japan has tried to pump collagen into people. Last year Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, revealed that has begun serving a variety of the meaty treats designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly. Last year Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, revealed that has begun serving a variety of the meaty treats designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly . Tokyo skin expert Tatsuto Tamura explains: 'This has been popular in Japan for generations although only now is it becoming mainstream and known in the West too. 'People here seek out collagen-enriched foods such as chicken, pigs' feet or shark fin because they believe it will help their skin,' he added. In the US, many restaurants now serve special 'wrinkle free' menus of dishes loaded with collagen. But the craze has not, however, impressed British skin specialists, and the British Skin Foundation claims that eating collagen does not benefit the skin in any way. Using X-ray beams, scientists were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments . It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world.",

Film director Paul Soriano (left) with actors Buboy Villar and Alessandra De Ross at the premiere of Kid Kulafu .

Soriano spent two years researching the film, much of it based on conversations with 36-year-old Pacquiao. 'Everyone can mimic his moves, but you can't easily copy his courage,' said Buboy Villar, who plays the young boxer. 'Pacquiao always faces people who are bigger than him and, as you can see, he's scrawny as a kid, so I think all the rough experiences he had growing up helped to make him strong.' The film opened in Philippine cinemas on Wednesday and will be shown in selected cinemas in the US and Canada later this month.

        "article": "A furious landowner was forced to fork out thousands of pounds to restore a public path to one of Britain's most popular beauty spots. James Weld stumped up \u00a315,000 to bring an end to a three year stand-off with Natural England over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at Durdle Door on Dorset's Jurassic Coast. The previous steps that lead down to the popular tourist attraction were washed away in storms in 2012. James Weld has stumped up \u00a315,000 to end a three-year stand-off with Natural England over access to Durdle Door beach . Since then visitors have faced a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore, even resorting to sliding down on their backsides. The iconic rock archway and neighbouring Lulworth Cove are part of the Weld family's 12,000-acre Lulworth estate. The family have maintained the steps since they first bought the land in the 1600s. But in 2009, Natural England was handed responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act.\u00a0The government also announced a 630-mile path along the south west coast which was to be opened in time for the Olympics. However, Mr Weld says that Natural England 'shirked' its duty to reinstate the steps under the law for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path. Calling the long-running dispute 'laughable and ludicrous', he also accused the organisation of ignoring advice given to them on how to manage tourist hotspots like the Lulworth Estate. The steps to access the iconic rock archway on the Dorset Jurassic coast had been washed away during storms in 2012 . Natural England said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on Mr Weld's claims. The estate took the decision to rebuild the 88 steps themselves after becoming 'utterly fed-up with the bureaucracy', Mr Weld said. Mr Weld, a chartered surveyor, said: 'For quite a number of decades now people have visited our coasts and beaches quite freely. 'About 20 or so years ago we decided to put in steps leading down to the beaches so they didn't have to scramble down the cliffs to get to them. In 2009 the Coastal Access Act came along and we had lots of meetings with Natural England about managing 'honeypot' sites like Lulworth. 'We had assurances from them that they wouldn't interfere with the Lulworth Estate because they were happy with the way we were running things. 'Then they announced their big idea, which was to open a 630-mile path along the south west coast in time for the Olympics - a path that had already existed for about 40 years - and duly spent a vast amount of money on it. The washed-away steps meant visitors were left to scramble up and down the dangerous crumbling cliffs to try and access the beach . The Government body had been granted responsibility for the country's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act 2009 . 'You can understand the idiocy of this plan. Our view was that if the coast path was now a public right of way under the Coastal Access Act and controlled by Natural England then Natural England should pay for it. 'One would have thought that would have been the logical answer but Natural England disagreed. 'Their response was that they were giving the public access to beaches but not the means to actually do it. 'In 2012 the steps down to Durdle Door were washed away in the heavy spring weather we had. It was clear the steps needed replacing but Natural England said they weren't responsible for them. 'We got to a stand-off with Natural England - we wanted them to accept their responsibility while they were saying 'it's nothing to do with us'. 'About six months ago we got utterly fed up with all the bureaucracy and took the decision to get on with it and pay for the steps ourselves. 'The cost was about \u00a315,000 - not a huge amount of money for a huge Government body like Natural England but a lot for us. Mr Weld says Natural England 'shirked' its duty for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path, leaving him to pay the \u00a315,000 to rebuild the steps which have now been reopened (pictured) 'We have a very good relationship with Natural England in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites. 'The whole thing has been laughable and ludicrous and I've lost patience with it. 'In the end, regardless of who was officially responsible or the cost, we felt the need to step in to put Durdle Door back on the map for walkers and sightseers, and to help minimise the environmental impact to this extraordinary coastal feature. 'Durdle Door is a national icon as well as one of Dorset's icons so we're delighted to be able to reopen it, but it's sad it's taken so long.' The \u00a315,000 will add to the \u00a340,000 the Lulworth Estate currently spends each year maintaining paths on its land. A spokesman for Natural England said: 'It's good news that the Durdle Door beach steps have been reopened and that local visitors can have safe access to the beach to enjoy this wonderful stretch of the English coast. 'We're not going to be responding to those remarks made by Mr Weld.' Humphrey Weld, a direct ancestor of James Weld, bought Lulworth Castle and its sprawling estate in 1641 from politician Thomas Howard, 3rd Viscount Howard of Bindon. The Weld estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove . Natural England said it was glad Durdle Door's beach steps have been reopened but would not comment on the landowner's claims . It has remained in the Weld family ever since. It was gutted by fire in 1929 and only fully restored in the 1990s by the Weld estate and English Heritage. The estate owns around five miles of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove. The two beauty spots attract more than 500,000 visitors a year. Agriculture plays a large part in the estate, and it still produces 25 million litres of milk a year, much of which is sold to Marks and Spencer. In 2013 Natural England said claims made by Lulworth Estate owner James Weld that the 2009 Coastal Access Act handed them responsibility for the steps to Durdle Door were untrue. A Natural England spokesman said in 2013: 'Contrary to Mr Weld's statement, the legislation does not take land away from landowners or interfere with their freedom to manage it. 'Durdle Door beach still belongs to the Lulworth Estate and is managed alongside the estate's nearby holiday park, generating revenue from visitors to the park and more widely. 'The estate has always maintained the steps down on to the beach and remains able to do so now.'",

        "article": "A white supremacist gunned down his gay boss for sexually abusing one of his young relatives, he told the court during his first appearance on Tuesday. 'Doing time's the easy part, you know what I'm saying?' Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, said as he was ushered out of the courtroom in Daytona Beach, Florida. He is accused of walking into Wayne County Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina on Monday and killing his former supervisor, Ronald Lane, 44, before fleeing  on a motorbike. He was arrested more than 500 miles away early on Tuesday after officers found him sleeping on a Florida beach. He will be extradited back to North Carolina to face a charge of open murder. Scroll down for video . In court: Kenneth Stancil, pictured in court on Tuesday, said he\u00a0'ridded one last child molester from the Earth' as he appeared before the judge in Daytona Beach, Florida. He is accused of killing his former boss . Outspoken: Even though he was advised of his right to remain silent, he reportedly admitted to the killing . On Tuesday, he appeared relaxed in the courtroom and, despite the judge advising him he had the right to remain silent, he admitted to the killing,\u00a0WRAL reported. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth', according to the station. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Stancil did not file a report about the alleged molestation with local authorities, according to the Wayne County sheriff's office. After Stancil was denied bond, he told the judge he did not blame him for the decision, and he was assigned a public defender. The 20-year-old had been a work-study student who reported to Lane, but he was dismissed from the program in March because of too many absences, according to the college. Arrested: Stancil, left, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane, right. The student, who was close to completing his three-year welding course with top marks, was dismissed from his job last month . By his side: Stancil's mother Debbie, pictured at his graduation, said Lane had made unwanted sexual comments towards her son, but she denied her son's claim that Lane had abused a young relative . Tragedy: Lane is pictured right with his long-term boyfriend, Chuck Tobin, who took his life last year . Police have said they are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime. Authorities would not elaborate but they confirmed Lane was gay. They are also investigating Stancil's possible links with white supremacist groups. On Facebook, he describes his interests as 'white pride' and calls himself the 'White Knight'. He also has multiple white supremacist tattoos across his body, including 'Brother Hood'across his neck and '88' beneath his eye. The number eight represents the eighth letter\u00a0in\u00a0the alphabet - H - and so is 88 understood to stand for 'Heil Hitler'. But his mother has claimed her son's tattoos marked a wannabe rather than someone with neo-Nazi beliefs. Lane had worked at the college for 18 years. His boyfriend of 12 years, Chuck Tobin, took his life last July after leaving their home and his remains were found in November. Stancil's mother, Debbie, has claimed\u00a0that Lane had fired her son without notice and claimed that he had 'made inappropriate sexual advances toward' him. Remembered: Students gather at a memorial at Wayne Community College for Ron Lane on Tuesday . Memorial: Flowers are seen at a makeshift memorial for Lane, who had worked at the college for 18 years . 'He was verbally inappropriate with [him[ at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' But she said she knows the relative was not sexually abused by Lane, as Stancil claimed in court, because the child and Lane had never met. She said she believes her son made the accusations because he is 'rattled and confused'. She also said that her son never recovered after finding his father in the backyard when he had killed himself in 2009, and said he was angry after being dismissed from his campus job. 'He had a moment of insanity,' she told the Associated Press. 'I don't know. He just snapped. That is not my son. He's probably out of his mind. I think he needs mental help.' Stancil had no criminal record before the shooting. Take over: A military style SWAT vehicle from the Johnston County Sheriff's Office arrived at the college after the 8am shooting on Monday. It is believed that Stancil targeted Lane before fleeing the building . Evacuated: Students were seen congregating in the college parking lot on Monday morning . Swoop: Authorities enter the home Stancil shares with his mother and two younger brothers on Monday . He was on the school's dean's list with a grade point average of 3.6 or better and due to graduate in July with a degree in welding technology, the school said. He was a Boy Scout who wrote in the letter he left explaining his deed that he still hoped to marry his girlfriend, his mother said. After fleeing the scene on Monday, Stancil was arrested at 1.20 am on Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Florida as a massive manhunt continued in North Carolina. He was taken into custody after deputies from the Volusia County Beach Patrol approached him for violating an ordinance that prohibits sleeping on the beach. 'I can say with confidence that Mr. Stancil had a calculated plan, and he carried out that plan,' Goldsboro police Sergeant Jeremy Sutton said during a Tuesday news conference.",

Munroe Bergdorf, the super sexy brunette as she looks now (left) and in 1999 when she was still a boy called Ian (right) Transgender Munroe has made a name for herself on London's party scene and now spins the decks in some of the country's most high end clubs . Munroe said: 'I had always known growing up that I was supposed to be a woman, but I'd always tried to hide it for fear of being different. 'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate. 'But I remember being about 17 and wondering how different my life would be if I didn't care what people think. 'It was then that it suddenly hit me - it was time to start being true to myself,' she said. 'I came out as gay to begin with at 15 and then I started dressing up as a woman and doing drag around three years later,' said Munroe. 'Soon I started the slow process to transition into a woman, it was the best decision I've ever made. Now (left) and then (right):\u00a0Munroe has transformed into a sexy beauty after growing up as a boy.\u00a0'I went to a very conservative all boys school that specialised in rugby - and I got picked on for being quite effeminate,' she says . Munroe (pictured at a party last year)\u00a0began her transition at the age of 19, and at 25 years old was offered hormones by her doctor . 'I'm now a DJ full time and I do some work within the fashion industry too,' said Munroe. 'I've worked for Calvin Klein in their press office, designed a lip gloss for Illamasqua, a make-up brand that I love, and I've even designed capsule lines for Boy London - Rihanna has worn one of my pieces. 'I also do a bit of modelling from time to time. 'Some people notice that I was once a boy, some people don't - but I'm happy to talk about it if they ask.' Munroe began living as a woman at the age of 18 and started taking drugs friends had been prescribed at 23. It was only at 25 she was offered the hormones by her doctor. She said: 'I first started taking hormones that had been prescribed to my other trans friends. The DJ explained: 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change' The stunning brunette (left and right)\u00a0modelled for a variety of fashion and beauty brands including Illamasqua and Boy London - made famous by Rihanna . 'It is not something that I would recommend at all, but the process can take such a long time, and once you've made the decision to become the person you really are, you just want to get on with it. 'It was really exciting to start taking the hormones and see my body change - and soon as I was given them by my doctor. 'It's like going through puberty again so I got quite self-conscious about the way I looked and dressed, and I felt as though I started to think differently.' 'I didn't really like explaining what was going on to people as I was doing this for myself, but friends and family were curious,' she said. 'My mum found out what was going on when she noticed my chest growing - it was a shock at first but she's very supportive. 'As soon as I noticed the change in myself it was like I wasn't ashamed any more,' she said. Munroe has now been taking hormones for four years, and has embraced her new life. She said: 'When I left university I got involved in fashion and the PR industry. 'I've had the opportunity of working with some incredible brands, designers and photographers, and I just love it. 'I've done everything from club promotion, modelling, PR, and now I'm a full time DJ. 'I DJ at major club nights and private members clubs in some of the most exclusive venues in London - I feel so lucky for everything that's come my way, I would never take it for granted. 'I'm still the same person I was before, I'm just in the right body now. 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise'. Munroe, pictured with her friend Conor, says of her transition: 'It was the best decision I've ever made' Munroe and her friend Stephano at London Fashion Week. The DJ believes:\u00a0'I want people to know that it's ok to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are' 'I look in the mirror and I feel like it's me who's looking back, rather than somebody I don't recognise,' says Munroe . Munroe now hopes her story will encourage other young transgender men and women to feel comfortable in their own skin. Munroe said: 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people and the rights that they deserve to have within society. 'I'm so much happier now than I was growing up. 'I want people to know that it's okay to be different, and that you shouldn't be scared of being the person you are. 'I talk quite openly now about what's I've been through and frequently speak publicly about trans rights and community issues. 'I think it's important that the world understands and respects transgender people, the struggles that they face and the rights that they deserve.'",

        "article": "Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic . Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout. 'I'm sure Jordan's wiped,' said Kevin Streelman, the Par-3 contest winner at Augusta National last week who finished tied for 12th behind Spieth. 'But he's 21 years old, he can handle it.' Spieth has had success here the previous two years, finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year. The RBC Heritage gave him an invite two years ago when Spieth was a rising, yet largely unknown 19 -year-old trying to make his way on tour. The top-10 finish, Spieth said, helped his confidence and status on the PGA Tour. 'This tournament helped with job security,' Spieth said. 'So it's a tournament that's close to me and I love it here.' The 21-year-old was in formidable form at Augusta and equaled Tiger Woods' tournament birdie record . Most Masters champions - and many of the game's best players - take the next week off after a pressure-packed week at Augusta National. Spieth heads a group of five ranked in the top 20 of the world (No. 10 Jim Furyk, No. 14 Patrick Reed, No. 17 Matt Kuchar and No. 19 Billy Horschel are the others) to compete this week. Streelman enjoys playing right after a major, knowing his game is honed in and peaking after a Grand Slam event. 'Your game is really primed and amped up,' he said. 'I'm very prepared.' Kuchar is the tournament's defending champion, holing out from a green-side bunker on the 72nd hole to defeat Luke Donald by a stroke. Spieth's success has him atop the FedEx Cup standings, the youngest player ever to lead that category. Spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the Masters at such a young age . There have only been two Masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing Harbour Town. Vijay Singh tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the Masters while Zach Johnson was sixth in 2007. Only Bernhard Langer is 1985 followed a Masters victory with a triumph a week later at the RBC Heritage. Spieth believes he'll be the same driven, focused competitor he's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child. That might be difficult after this week's spotlight. Spieth got congratulatory Tweets from stars like Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and about 200 texts and emails since the victory. 'Given some time, that will subside a little bit,' he said. What won't ease up, Spieth said, is his desire to achieve the very best in golf, a quest that continues at Harbour Town. 'I was very much looking forward to getting back here, getting on solid ground and taking a deep breath,' Spieth said. 'I'm really looking forward to this week.'",

        "article": "Ed Balls was today accused of 'letting the cat out of the bag' on tax rises after leaving the door open to trapping more middle-class workers in the 40p tax rate. In an interview the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out trying to balance the books by lowering the amount workers have to earn before they pay the higher income tax rate. The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen from about 2million to 5million in two decades, but the Tories have promised to lift the threshold if they are returned to power. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, pictured giving a speech in Glasgow today, has repeatedly refused to rule out using the point at which the higher income tax rate kicks in to raise money to balance the books . The Shadow Chancellor was joined by the Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy at the Royal Concert hall in Glasgow today . Labour has vowed not to increase VAT or National Insurance as part of measures to bring down the deficit if they win the election. But pressed on income tax, Mr Balls refused to rule out freezing or lowering the threshold to raise millions from people earning more than \u00a341,865. In an interview on ITV Westcountry, Mr Balls was asked if was 'leaving the door open tonight to changing the tax thresholds that mean people in that 40 per cent bracket could be paying more tax under you'. The shadow chancellor refused to rule it out: 'What I would like to do is find ways in which I could have fewer people in the 40 per cent tax bracket. Of course I would. 'But I have to be honest with people. The deficit is going to be \u00a390 billion. I have got to find a way to get the deficit down in a careful, and staged and balanced way.' He said he would not be 'raising the higher rate of income tax' but left open the possibility of holding or lowering the point at which it kicks in. 'What I cannot do is go through every detail of the tax system. It's really complicated. 'I am not going to make unfunded commitment to do so, because I fear in the end that will be a VAT rise from the Tories. You won't get that from me.' Pressed on whether he plans to change the income tax bands, Mr Balls said: 'I can't go through every detail.' He went on: 'I can make a promise not to increase the basic rate of income tax or the higher rate of income tax. The threshold is also an important detail and that's complex.' Chancellor George Osborne, visiting the Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton with David Cameron today. claimed Mr Balls had 'let the cat out of the bag . The number of people paying 40p tax has already risen by about two million to five million in two decades . Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Ed Balls has let the cat out of the bag and confirmed a tax assault on middle earners. He has confirmed that he and Ed Miliband will put up taxes on middle Britain. It is part of Labour's \u00a33,000 tax rise for working families. 'By contrast, the Conservative plan is to increase to \u00a350,000 the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of tax. So there is a clear choice. 'Economic security and lower taxes with David Cameron and our long-term economic plan. Or economic chaos and higher taxes under Ed Miliband.' David Cameron has warned the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on 'middle incomes'. The Prime Minister claims it is wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was 'only ever meant for the better off'. The Conservatives go into the election pledging to raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from \u00a341,865 to \u00a350,000 by 2020.\u00a0Workers would also pay no income tax on the first \u00a312,500 they earn. But Labour says the policy is a \u00a37billion unfunded tax cut at a time when billions are needed in spending cuts. A Labour spokesman said: 'Under the Tories around 2 million more people have been dragged into the 40p tax band, but Labour supported the increases in the 40p threshold in the recent Budget. 'Tory promises to raise the 40p threshold further are completely unfunded and will cost billions of pounds. Together with their extreme spending plans, these unfunded commitments will mean the Tories end up raising VAT again and cutting the NHS. 'When we make tax promises, such as introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax to help millions on middle and low incomes, we have set out where the money is coming from. 'Working people are paying more under this government, which is why the only tax changes we are proposing are on the very richest in society like reversing the Tory tax cut for millionaires.'",

        "article": "An Indian-style bungalow that was built in Sussex in the Victorian era and preserved to maintain its 1880s facade has gone on the market for \u00a31million. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park near East Grinstead has been lovingly upheld to how its first owners intended it in the 19th Century. With wood paneling on indoor ceilings and a large veranda at its front, the unique property is one of the first ever bungalows built in the country. It has gone on the market for \u00a3985,000, with historians eager to put it forward for listing to further protect its heritage. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park in East Grinstead has gone on sale for almost \u00a31million. The property is one of the last surviving bungalows in Britain that were built on the design of Victorian houses in India . An early photograph of the house shows how it has been lovingly preserved by its owners since its construction in the late 19th Century . Inside, original oak panelling adorns the ceilings and walls. The double height living room is one of the house's main features with a quirky gallery serving as a make-shift office . A sketch of the property's main sitting room shows how its Victorian design has been maintained to how architects originally intended it . Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, known as Bungalow Briggs, the property is not all split over one level as modern bungalows are today. At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar.\u00a0The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes . An architect's drawing of the property in the 20th Century. Historians are eager to put the house forward for listing to further protect its heritage . One of the house's most distinct features is its large veranda at the front. These were a common feature among Victorian properties in India . The house's current owner said she fell in love with its unique design and layout when she bought it in 1983 and has tried to preserve its character . Other unique features which make the property so notable are two stained glass windows that have Victorian messages inscribed on them . One of the four bedrooms in the house that is set over more than 2,000sq ft. Original oak and wood flooring has been maintained . The property has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. It is being sold for \u00a3985,000 . 'It\u2019s a great place, I fell in love with it 32 years ago and I still love it after all these years,' said Marian Parker, 60. 'The big drawing room is double height and has this little gallery which I use as a study. The room opens on to the veranda and is a lovely room with lots of light in summer but it also has an open fireplace and is really cosy in winter. 'It looks very different from the front to the back. From the front it looks like a normal bungalow but when you go round to the back it looks like a three-storey house because you can see the cellar.' With two stained glass windows and an original oak panelling in the hall and lounge, historians are eager to put the property forward to be listed. Dr Kathryn Ferry, an architectural historian and author of the book Bungalows, said: 'This is one of the earliest surviving bungalows in Britain and certainly one of the most important. 'What makes this one so significant is it was part of a bungalow settlement as if built in India on a hill station where the colonial British went to escape from the heat of the cities, sitting on their verandas in the cool breeze. 'There are a couple of bungalows in the development left but this one is the most original. 'Bungalows weren\u2019t about single storey living, they were more of a leisure house and this exemplifies that. Bungalows aren\u2019t just boring suburban homes. 'It is not listed but it ought to be. We can\u2019t put it forward for listing yet in case it puts off buyers. But hopefully whoever does buy it will appreciate its importance enough to support a bid to list it.' The house is being sold \u00a0by Hamptons International for \u00a3985,000 and has not yet attracted any offers. A view of the property from one of its gardens. It is set over almost one acre of land in the Sussex countryside in East Grinstead . While the house is one of many of the same style built in the area by architect RA Briggs, historians have described it as one of the best remaining examples of a Victorian-Indian bungalow .",

        "article": "The elderly husband who has been charged with the murder of two women in Victoria nearly 24 years ago - one of them being his wife - has described the accusations as 'bizarre'. Robert Penny told the Herald Sun that he was shocked when police charged him\u00a0with murdering Claire Acocks and his wife Margaret Penny at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers in Portland on May 3, 1991, about 350km west of Melbourne. The 83-year-old,\u00a0of Malvern East, has spoken out since he briefly appeared at Melbourne Magistrates court on Monday. Margaret Penny was murdered in a hair salon in Portland, Victoria on May 3, 1991 . Also brutally murdered at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers was Claire Acocks . Nearly 24 years after the horrific event Margaret's husband Robert Denny, 83, has been charged with two counts of murder . 'It's been hanging over my head for a year and it's not having a very good effect on me. Not knowing anything about it, really, and to be charged with a double murder - what the hell would I want to murder someone for?'\u00a0Mr Penny told the Herald Sun. 'They had some new faces in the police force that were investigating and they suddenly decided it was my problem... It's just bizarre.' Mr Penny also revealed that he called his late-wife's sister, Ann Bryden, to further plead his innocence a day after facing court. 'He rang and said, \"I didn't do it, why would I kill her? We were in love\",' Ms Bryden told the Herald Sun. Ms Bryden then said that she does not believe Mr Penny killed his wife.

Claire Acocks and Margaret Penny were found badly beaten, repeatedly stabbed, with their throats cut and were wrapped in black hair wraps, the\u00a0Herald Sun reported. His current wife was in court on the day, and the accused was seen waving at the woman - who reportedly has concerns about her elderly husband's health. Police launched a cold case investigation into the murders in 2006, and Penny resurfaced as a suspect last year, despite being cleared of any involvement\u00a0during the original investigation. He was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6. Penny was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6, and is expected to apply for bail on Monday afternoon .

'We are grateful for the determination of the homicide squad detectives who have continued to investigate this matter to endeavour to gain a resolution for us and justice for Claire,' they later said in a statement. The family said they were 'extremely encouraged' by the developments but would not comment further while the matter is before the courts.

        "article": "On Wednesday, Sportsmail revealed for the first time how popular each Premier League club is around the globe according to Twitter followers. Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China \u2013 where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter\u2019s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans \u2013 just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United\u2019s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter \u2013 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez\u2019s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six \u2013 United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao \u2013 managed by Fabio Cannavaro \u2013 third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th \u2013 with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham \u2013 and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China \u2013 in December 2014 the China\u2019s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum \u2013 expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season.

        "article": "(CNN)Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. \"When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,\" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative \"Tech Needs Girls\" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. \"I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,\" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show \"the community the value of educating girls.\" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. \"Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. \"I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that.\" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of \"Tech Needs Girls,\" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called \"Slum Voices\". \"I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,\" Agyare says. \"I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard.\" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that \"we don't leave anyone behind.\" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. \"He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that.\" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is \"to be their wife,\" Agyare explains, \"and she needs to be taken care of.\" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age \"can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society].\" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to \"use technology in whatever field they find themselves.\" She adds: \"It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.\" Read this: 5 reasons why tech needs geek girls .

        "article": "The continents of North and South America came together much earlier than previously thought, according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in Colombia of the land bridge that connected the long-isolated landmasses. The two continents are linked at Panama, but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared, with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago. The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, presents evidence that the Panama land bridge formed at least 10 million years earlier. Before the Isthmus of Panama rose from the sea by tectonic and volcanic action, the Central American Seaway linked the Atlantic to the Pacific as one great ocean. The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. Until then, a deep water channel called the Central American Seaway separated the continents. The researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern Colombia that originated in Panama and were 13 million to 15 million years old. These grains suggested the land bridge must have existed at that time, they said. 'We contend that a bridge, perhaps a transient one, was present since 13 to 15 million years ago,' said geologist Camilo Montes of Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, who led the study. 'Beds younger than about 13 to 15 million years contain abundant zircon grains with a typically Panamanian age,' said Montes. 'Older beds do not. 'We think these zircons were deposited by rivers flowing from the Isthmus of Panama when it docked to South America, nearly 10 million years earlier than the date of 3 million years that is usually given for the connection.' The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. One of the most dramatic results of the joining of the two Americas was the mixing of the animals living on the respective landmasses, with various creatures crossing the land bridge to invade the other continent. The event is known as the Great American Biological Interchange. After the Isthmus of Panama formed, animals and plants could move back and forth between continents, the Great American Biological Interchange. Smithsonian scientists are debating when this happened. South America had a unique animal population, with exotic marsupials including saber-toothed predators, as well as elephant-sized ground sloths, car-sized armadillos, camel-like creatures with elephant trunks and giant flightless, carnivorous 'terror birds.' North America had a quite different and impressive array of placental mammals including saber-toothed cats and other feline predators, huge short-faced bears, wolves and various herbivores including big elephant relatives and horses. The two continents continue to move together. 'Yes, the plates are moving today,' Montes said. 'They never stop.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "Forget friendly competition \u2013 it seems that real friends in the fashion world will do all they can in order to help promote each other, including starring in a campaign for a competing label. Versace designer Donatella Versace, 59, is set to appear in a new ad campaign not for her own brand, but for rival design house Givenchy. Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, 40, revealed the surprising pick for his fall-winter campaign on Instagram yesterday, posting a black and white photo of himself and Donatella, who he described as his \u2018ultimate icon\u2019. Double the designer power: Versace designer Donatella Versace appears in a photo with Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy's new ad campaign . 'So proud and honored to introduce my new ultimate icon: Donatella Versace... FW15 Givenchy Family Campaign [sic],' he wrote, while promising that more images from the campaign will be unveiled soon. Donatella re-posted the snap on her own account, captioning it: 'For my talented friend Riccardo. Together we break fashion boundaries today!' 'You made my day unforgettable,' she continued in another post, thanking Riccardo and the shoot's photographers, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Fashionable friends: Donatella, left, and Riccardo, second from left, are longtime friends; they are pictured here with Franca Sozzani, second from right, and Naomi Campbell, right . Big name in the business: Donatella regularly appears in ads for her own design house, Versace, but this is the first time she is modeling for another designer. Casting Donatella in the campaign is without a doubt an unusual choice - both high-fashion brands attract similar clientele, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Zoe Saldana - but the designers have actually been friends for years, since first meeting at a Vogue Italia dinner a decade ago. In fact, Donatella\u00a0interviewed Riccardo for Interview Magazine\u00a0in 2011, telling him she found his most recent collection at the time to be 'very beautiful - super sexy' before adding that she would 'wear all of it'. That didn't surprise Riccardo, as the designer explained that he was 'obsessed' with Versace as a child and is still inspired by the brand's designs. 'Donatella, you are so much of a Givenchy woman!' he told her. 'I would really love to see you dressed in Givenchy.' Backstage BFFs: Riccardo posted this photo of himself with Donatella during Paris Haute Couture Week . Both Givenchy and Versace have many celebrity fans; Donatella is pictured here with Versace lovers Kate Hudson, left, and Goldie Hawn, right, at Paris Fashion Week this year . Riccardo has more recently proved that he is a fan of Donatella's work as well. At Paris Haute Couture Week earlier this year, the Givenchy designer posted a picture of the pair together backstage and referred to Donatella as a 'couture queen' in the photo's caption. Now, Donatella is returning the complement by lending her face to his Givenchy ads. 'You are one of the most talented designers there,' she told him in 2011. 'What you and I have in common, Donatella, [is] that careful balance,' he said, referring to their joint ability to push boundaries without becoming vulgar. Now the pair will have Givenchy's fall-winter campaign in common too.",

        "article": "The runaway success of Furious 7 shows no signs of slowing down as the high-octane action movie enjoyed its third winning weekend in a row at the domestic box office. The reigning box office champion might have slowed from its blockbuster debut, but Furious 7 maintained first place for the third weekend in a row with an estimated $29.1 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak on Sunday. This brings the fast car sequel's domestic total to a staggering $294 million, well above the $202.8 million that Fast & Furious 6 had earned at the same point in the cycle in 2013. Scroll down for video . The fast car sequel, starring Vin Diesel, has raced to number seven on the list of highest grossing movies in just three weeks and is predicted to overtake the likes of Frozen and Iron Man 3 in a matter of weeks . Crashing hit: The blockbuster, also co-starring Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, has already earned $1 billion . On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide. Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion. With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out. 'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend . Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce. 'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said. 'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.' Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.' Meanwhile, the low-budget, social media themed thriller Unfriended took third place with $16 million \u2014 sixteen times its production budget.",

        "article": "He has taken millions of selfies - including during this campaign. But yesterday the Prime Minister used a selfie stick for the first time. It happened as David Cameron toured Pirate FM during a visit to Cornwall to lay out Conservative plans for the southwest. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, used a selfie stick for the first time during visit to Cornwall . The PM posed with the telescopic device to take a photograph with staff at Pirate FM . Selfie sticks work by fixing the camera to an adjustable clamp on a telescopic arm, allowing the users to feature in the wide angle photo they are taking. Mr Cameron travelled down to the south west on the sleeper train. He told staff that other world leaders have selfie sticks, including the Prime Minister of Finland. During his visit to the station Mr Cameron was presented with a Cornish t-shirts emblazoned 'If You Can Smell My Pasty, You're Too Close.' Mr Cameron kindly volunteered to give that to the chancellor - a reference to George Osborne's infamous budget in which he proposed a 'pasty tax'. Mr Cameron likes to project an image as the 'chillaxing' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister looked exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance today, ahead of a speech in which he delivered his 'plan for Cornwall'. Mr Cameron arrived in Penzance yesterday morning after spending eight hours on the train from Paddington . He was dressed very casually as he alighted the sleeper carriage after the eight-hour journey . Mr Cameron said it was nice to have a night without the children or Mrs Cameron nudging him in the ribs . The Conservatives are battling against their Coalition partners in the South-West as they seek to wrest control of key constituencies from the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Cameron is still trailing Ed Miliband's Labour Party nationally, with just 13 days to go until polling day. The Prime Minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight-hour journey from London's Paddington station. His hair was unkempt and he was wearing an unusual combination of jeans with shiny loafers which might be considered more appropriate for a smart business suit. Mr Cameron sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt, and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers, which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry. While the jacket may have looked inoffensive, the Tory leader may have been making a political statement in support of the Union, as it appears to have been made by Scottish firm Lyle & Scott. Similar models retail online for around \u00a3125. Speaking at a factory later, he insisted that he had in fact slept very well - because his wife Samantha was not there to complain about him talking in his sleep. Mr Cameron said: 'It was very comfortable, very nice it was too, to have a night without the children waking me up or Mrs Cameron nudging me in the ribs and telling me to shut up for talking in my sleep.'",

The club have said in a statement they will appeal on the grounds the incident that left Northampton wing George North unconscious and resulted in a red card for Hughes was an accident and no foul play had occurred. With the hearing scheduled to be held next Friday, it means Hughes can not be reprieved in time to face the reigning European champions in Toulon this weekend. Wasps are set to appeal the three-match ban handed to No 8 Nathan Hughes for knocking out George North . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score a try for Northampton . Hughes was given the suspension - to include three meaningful fixtures - after being found guilty of striking North in the 52-30 Aviva Premiership defeat at Franklin's Gardens on March 27. Commenting on the judgement made on Tuesday night, disciplinary officer Sir James Dingemans said: 'This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found. 'However, there was recklessness meaning that, notwithstanding the harm, it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record.' Wales winger North suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against Wasps last Friday .",

        "article": "She enraged Twitter users by saying that 'unhealthy lifestyles' should not be 'facilitated', and now the plus-size industry has spoken out about Jamelia's comments on Loose Women. Critics and the public have spoken out after Jamelia said that obese women 'should feel uncomfortable' about their unhealthy size, and that high street stores should not be catering for them. The panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20. Scroll down for video . The Loose Women panellist aired her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers,\u00a0saying that 'unhealthy lifestyles' should not be 'facilitated', and now the plus-size industry has taken to social media to share their own views on the topic . As the market for plus-size fashion consumption grows, Alice Dogruyol, Founder of all-inclusive denim brand, Beauty in Curves, believes that Jamelia\u2019s message to women is incredibly disturbing. She said: 'We come in all shapes and sizes and we all deserve to enjoy shopping for clothes whether we are a size zero or a size 20 plus. It is such a shame that Jamelia has used her privileged position of influence to encourage people to feel ashamed of themselves. 'The thought that a person should be made to feel excluded from having access to lovely clothes is absurd and trying to link clothes size to health is also uninformed. 'Our ethos at Beauty in Curves is to make women look and feel great about their bodies and give women more choice and access to great quality premium denim.' This lady named Charlotte happily posed her pictured to Twitter in support of plus size women . This lady named Kelly said that she was proud of her curves . On Thursday, Jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult.' She said: 'Some of the things that have been printed I have actually said but not in that context... It's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way.' Many 'normal' women have also lambasted the star taking to Twitter using the hashtag #wearethethey to show off their curvy photographs. One user named @vampira246 posted a picture of herself in a pair of dungarees and a pink top saying: '#wearethethey !!!!!! I'm a size 22-24 and I rock my outfits!!!.' Another called @applecharlotte said: '#wearethethey - ty @debzjs for starting this hashtag in response to @Jamelia's comments.' Another lady called @charlotteBHC said: 'Jamilia\u00a0consciously wished discomfit on a group of marginalised people, I'm one of those people #wearethethey [sic].' Debz, who set up WeAreTheThey, told FEMAIL she did so because she 'doesn't believe in ignoring bullies'. 'The whole point of the hashtag is not health or weight. People's health is their own business and if someone chooses to be plus size and healthy or unhealthy that is up to them. The idea behind the hashtag is that EVEN if people are unhealthy, they have a right to buy clothing without being made to feel uncomfortable. 'Jamelia called for a large spectrum of people being made to feel uncomfortable JUST because they COULD be unhealthy and that will never be acceptable to me or the other people using the #WeAreTheWay tag.' The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20. 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon. 'I was referring to extreme sizing, I was referring to health and how we should all participate in helping our youngsters to live healthier lifestyles.' Women took to Twitter to post their pictures under the #wearethethey, they have defended their bodies against Jamelia's comments . Jamelia's co-panellists were quick to leap to her defence. Ruth Langsford, 55, stated: 'I definitely, categorically said we're not talking about size 14, 16 or even 18.' Janet Street Porter, 68, then said: 'I was completely in agreement with Jamelia and I said you've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25, can she run around with her children, can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later? 'So I do feel like Jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on.' 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon (pictured). 'I was referring to extreme sizing' Jamelia's co-panellists, Ruth Langford (left), Coleen Nolan (center left) and Janet Street Porter (right) were quick to leap to her defence . Jamelia also appeared on Good Morning Britain to say that she was sorry for upsetting people. 'I didn\u2019t make it clear on the show that I was talking about extremes, I was talking about above size 20 and below size six, those sizes being available en masse,' she said. 'Knowing that I offended people really upset me. Knowing that I made people question themselves and their choices, it really did upset me. All I can do is apologise for that.' But the star added: 'I do stand by what I said. I\u2019m a real woman with real opinions. I get paid to voice my opinions. Social media users weighed in on Twitter, telling Jamelia to 'keep it shut' and accusing the singer of 'stirring up hatred' on the topic . Appearing on Good Morning America earlier today, Jamelia, pictured with GMB presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid, said she still stood by her remarks . Jamelia said of the reaction: 'It\u2019s been absolutely awful but this is my job. I believe we are all entitled to our opinion. 'I genuinely love people and believe everyone has the right to feel wonderful and feel beautiful and it was never my intention to make people feel any less than what they are.' Speaking on Loose Women yesterday, in the conversation which sparked the controversy, Jamelia said: 'I do not think it's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle, in the same way I don't believe that a size zero should be available - it's not a healthy size for an average woman to be.' Jamelia first response to yesterday's Twitter backlash was a quote (pictured) Jamelia, who also claimed she was 'all for celebrating people as they are', added: 'I don't believe they [high street stores] should be providing clothes for below that range or above that range. 'Yes, have specialist shops, but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy... to be available in every High Street store, I don't think that's right.' Viewers were were enraged by her comments and vented on Twitter, with many declaring she should be 'sacked' from the show, and not a single user taking her side. 'I'm so disappointed with Jamelia's comments on Loose Women today. WE. ARE. NOT. PROMOTING. UNHEALTHY.LIFESTYLES. #PlusSizeDebate,' wrote one. On Monday, Jamelia showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, which asks people to snap a first-take selfie and share it unfiltered (pictured) Viewers were quick to criticise the former singer's comments on Twitter . One asked Jamelia directly what 'large girls' are supposed to wear, if not clothes . Other fans said they were 'disappointed' with the singer's comments . 'Ah Jamelia. The advocate for self esteem telling people that if you're over a certain size you shouldn't shop on the high street. Idiot,' argued another. Indeed, on Monday the singer showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, by snapping a first-take selfie and sharing it on social media unfiltered. Jamelia responded to the Twitter backlash with a quote yesterday afternoon. 'Never waste your time trying to explain, to people committed to misunderstanding you,' she tweeted to her 34,000 followers. Jamelia, pictured in London last week, says she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult'",

        "article": "Wolf Hall writer Hilary Mantel's award-winning second novel Bring Up The Bodies has been renamed for the American stage. The bestselling author, who once pledged not to dumb down her work ahead of its BBC debut, has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway. In preparation, the title of her second book Bring Up the Bodies has been ditched in favour of the simpler 'Wolf Hall II'. Booker Prize award-winner Mantel, who has been reworking Mike Poulton's stage version, has also cut 'a lot of repetition'\u00a0to create a tighter, better play. Scroll down for video . The bestselling author has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway (pictured is\u00a0Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn) With more than 1,000 pages of historical drama, the story of the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell - who goes from a Blacksmith's son to one of the most powerful men in Tudor court - was never a simple read. The plays, produced by the Royal Shakespeare company and London's Playful Productions, will open at the Winter Garden Theatre in Times Square tomorrow and features the original British cast as well as director Jermey Herrin. And Mantel is convinced it will be a hit on Broadway. Warning: Hilary Mantel said she believed that the Broadway version of her books will be a hit . The British cast, including\u00a0Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Paul Jesson as Cardinal Wolsey, will be going over to the U.S. as they prepare for the Broadway adaption which opens tomorrow . Nathaniel Parker, who won an Olivier award for his role as Henry VIII in the stage version of Wall Hall, told the Evening Standard: 'The play is better now than it was in London. 'Hilary has had a go at re-working\u00a0it and she's cut a lot of\u00a0repetition\u00a0out and brought in her own words. 'I think audiences will love it.' The story was recently brought to the small screen in the BBC adaption starring  Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and\u00a0Mark Rylance as his adviror Thomas Cromwell. The mini-series received rave reviews when it aired earlier this year, and was dubbed BBC 2's most successful drama in a decade after drawing in four million viewers. Critics praised its story, acting and historical accuracy as makers went to such great lengths to recreate the Tudor period they used only candlelight to illuminate night-time scenes, filmed on location using special cameras. Actor Damian Lewis played Henry VIII in the hit television adaptation on  BBC of Mantel's award-winning story . Mantel, who saw sales of her books boosted by the adaptation, had said ahead of the BBC version that she refused to 'dumb down' to suit a broad television audience. The author had warned the adaption was 'complex', and she would not reduce it to 'clich\u00e9s and over-simplifications'. The plays, written by Mike Poulton, sold out at Stratford-upon-Avon and quickly transferred to London, where they received critical raves, broke box office records and triumphed as the West End's biggest hit plays. Reprising their performances from the London production, Ben Miles as Cromwell, Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn will be going over to Broadway. Mantel is currently writing her third novel in the Cromwell trilogy titled The Mirror and The Light.",

New Muppets TV content hasn't been since since Muppets Tonight ended in 1998, though old episodes have been re-run extensively and several movies have been filmed. Scroll down for video . Light the lights? Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy could be back on TV screens soon if a planned pilot of a rebooted Muppets Show proves a success . A 'proof of concept' presentation for advertising executives is in the works already, ABC confirmed to DailyMail.com. Filming is due to take place next weekend at a Disney studio in Burbank, California - and will see some original Muppet puppeteers take the reins again. The episode will start with Muppets stalwarts including Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo gathering at ABC Studios in the hope of getting the new show off the ground. But the cuddly characters will apparently have a problem to solve - Miss Piggy hasn't agreed to join in, and is reluctant to get involved so long as she is going through a rough patch with her on-off lover Kermit.

        "article": "Nick Gunn: He had affairs with women on his rounds . A councillor who stabbed his wife nine times with a kitchen knife after discovering her affair with the postman was yesterday found guilty of attempted murder. Joseph O'Riordan, 76, left his wife Mandy, 47, with life-threatening injuries to the chest, torso and back after flying into a rage over her infidelity. But today it can be revealed that her married postman lover, Nick Gunn, 41, had previous affairs with women on his rounds. While his wife last night refused to discuss her unfaithful husband, a former girlfriend revealed their relationship ended because he had been sleeping with a woman on his rounds. She also told how when she confronted him about the affair, he confessed that he had cheated on a previous partner with a woman he had been delivering post to. Mr Gunn started an affair with Mrs O'Riordan last year and the romance led to her husband placing a GPS tracker on her car as he hired a private detective to watch her movements. The couple had been married for ten years and had attended the Queen's garden party in 2013 for O'Riordan's work on the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Yesterday he showed no emotion as a jury took just two hours and ten minutes to reach a unanimous verdict and find him guilty of trying to kill his wife. Brighton Crown Court had heard how he repeatedly stabbed his wife in their bedroom on October 22 last year, after arguing about the affair. The pair lived in a ground floor flat where Mrs O'Riordan worked as an estate manager on a residential home in Polegate, East Sussex. Mrs O'Riordan and Mr Gunn \u2013 nicknamed 'Tommy' by friends and family \u2013 had known each other for a number of years when he lived in the Sussex village and worked as a postman. Guilty: Joseph O'Riordan, 74, stabbed his wife Amanda, 47, (pictured together above) nine times with a kitchen knife at the home they shared in Polegate, East Sussex, after discovering her affair with postman Nick Gunn . Last year \u2013 despite having married three years ago and having moved with his wife Sara Saunders to Portslade, near Brighton \u2013 Mr Gunn and Mrs O'Riordan became lovers. But she was not his first, it is claimed. A 39-year-old former partner, who did not want to be named, said: 'We split up because he was having an affair. I saw that he had made a comment on Facebook about a 'lover' and I knew he wasn't talking about me so I confronted him. 'He admitted he had been sleeping with a woman he had been delivering post to. He told me that something similar had happened with a previous girlfriend as well. We were together for six years, and this might have happened more than once. I didn't find out until July 2011.' After that affair Mr Gunn married schoolteacher Miss Saunders, who said last night: 'I'm still married to him at the moment and I'm not interested in talking about him.' O'Riordan (left) was convicted of attempted murder today after a jury took just two hours and ten minutes to unanimously find him guilty of trying to kill his wife with a nine-inch kitchen knife (right) in October last year . O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council when he grew suspicious that his wife, Amanda, 47, was having an affair and hired a private investigator to follow her which confirmed her relationship with Mr Gunn . Mr Gunn has a Facebook page and describes himself on Twitter as: 'A Gamer, a Lover, a Postman and a friend of Death.' As the affair developed last year, O'Riordan first hired a detective to watch his wife and then set up a GPS tracker on her car. The \u00a3300 tracker reported back via text to O'Riordan's phone whenever his wife left home and gave the exact location of her vehicle. On one day alone on October 9 the tracker sent a total of 35 notifications to O'Riordan as his wife visited Mr Gunn at his then home in Portslade. O'Riordan used to run nightclubs in the South East before he retired and was also a councillor in East Sussex and became president of his local Royal British Legion. Mrs O'Riordan was a 23-year-old divorcee when she met the older O'Riordan in 1991. They married in 2004 and were seen by many friends as the 'perfect, loving couple'. Friends and family of Mrs\u00a0O'Riordan arrived at Brighton Magistrates' Court (left) for the verdict today while\u00a0O'Riordan's son Liam - from a previous marriage - also attended the hearing to see his father convicted . But as O'Riordan became older his wife essentially became his 'carer' and the court heard how she wanted more 'freedom'. Prosecutor Dale Sullivan said O'Riordan had 'clearly lied' when he told police officers repeatedly that he had stabbed his wife because he had 'just found out she was having an affair'. In reality he had known for weeks that she was seeing Mr Gunn. When Mrs O'Riordan gave evidence last week she did so from behind a screen so she did not have to see O'Riordan. She told the court: 'I loved Joe. I didn't want to hurt him. I never wanted to hurt him \u2013 even now.' O'Riordan is due to be sentenced today. Mr Gunn was unavailable for comment. O'Riordan will be sentenced for attempted murder at Brighton Crown Court (pictured above) tomorrow .",

        "article": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him \u2013 but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur\u2019s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal . Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run . Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea\u2019s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas\u2019 late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances \u2013 as many as the rest of Chelsea\u2019s back four put together \u2013 and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal\u2019s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over \u2013 one more than they\u2019d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing\u00a0Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January \u2013 a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them \u2013 a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom\u2019s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion\u2019s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football\u2019s black and white days \u2013 every one of Albion\u2019s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow \u2013 and captain Darren Fletcher\u2019s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns . 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It\u2019s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total \u2013 Christian Benteke\u2019s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park . 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman\u2019s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn\u2019t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue \u2013 Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals\u2019 youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months \u2013 just in time to be available for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke\u2019s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon . 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One \u2013 it\u2019s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe\u2019s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who\u2019ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City .",

        "article": "Landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near-vertical rock face in Bolivia. And although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers, Bolivia\u2019s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity that forced the earth upwards. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints - and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to  unknown species. Boliva\u2019s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity, forcing earth upwards and preserving the precious trackways so that dinosaur tracks are seen on a vertical 'wall' (pictured) The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs,The Daily Beast reported. Some of them are more than a metre in length, indicating the size of some of the vast beasts that roamed the area in the upper cretaceous period - a time in which the majority of dinosaurs lived. At first glance, it appears that large dinosaurs such as the Titanosaurs and armoured Ankylosauruses hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope, which measures one mile (1.5km). But the imprinted rock was once horizontal before being pushed upwards by tectonic activity. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, Bolivia (left), comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints (right) \u2013 and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to unknown species . The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs. Some, like the one pictured, are large . In 2009, fossil hunters came across what are thought to be among the world's largest dinosaur prints. Measuring 5ft (1.5 metres) wide, they were made by long-necked sauropods 150 million years ago and were found in chalky sediment in the Jura plateau of eastern France. It's thought the Late Jurassic dinosaurs were more than 75 ft (23 metres) long and weighed up to 40 tonnes. Palaeontologist Jean-Michel Mazin of France\u2019s National Centre of Scientific Research, said at the time, from the prints, \u2018we can calculate their size and speed, find out about their behaviour and learn how they got around.' \u2018They were very hard to see because there were a lot of little stones (on the ground), there was grass growing there, and you really had to have a trained eye to notice something,\u2019 Dr Mazin said. The area was not mountainous when the dinosaurs were alive and the region had lots of water and islands, meaning the tracks were preserved by the sea and sediment. This activity thrust a huge slab of earth upwards, which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face. However, the site looked very different millions of years ago, when the region was muddy and flat. The dinosaurs left their mark while walking along the shoreline of a large lake. There are layers of prints preserved in the limestone because the marks hardened in dry periods, before being covered in preservative mud, enabling the process to start again. Paleontologist Klaus Schutt also suggested that a huge volcanic eruption threw millions of cubic metres of ash into space 68 million years ago, which gradually covered the prints to protect them, Unesco\u00a0reported. A decade after the discovery, which was made by miners in the mid 1980s, palaeontologists began to document the prints. Due to the spacing of these prints, experts can use them to reveal clues about the dinosaurs\u2019 gait, build and lifestyle. One set of tracks, for example, revealed two lines of prints with a smaller pair, suggesting a baby walked alongside its parents, while another set, now known as Johnny Walker, was made by a baby T.Rex. When some are removed, or crumble away, more are revealed underneath. While there may be more precious footprints yet to be found, some experts say Cal Orcko, which means \u2018lime hill\u2019 in the Quechua tongue, is under threat from human activity. The imprinted rock was pushed upwards by tectonic activity, thrusting a huge slab of earth upwards, which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face (pictured) At first glance, it appears that large dinosaurs (such as the one pictured) as well as Titanosaurs and armoured Ankylosauruses, hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope . The site, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre (shown on the map) attracts 120,000 tourists every year, which some believe is a threat to the site, as well as a nearby cement works that uses limestone . The dinosaurs left their mark (pictured) while walking along the shoreline of a large lake. Their tracks dried in the hot season and were preserved before more mud and possibly volcanic ash covered and preserved them . The site attracts 120,000 tourists every year, while a nearby cement factory pulls limestone from a local quarry. \u2018The cliff has been quite affected by the many years of extracting the raw material,\u2019 Elizabeth Baldivieso, administrator of Cretaceous Park which protects the fossil filed, told AFP. But she has been branded an alarmist. A decade after their discovery, which was made by miners in the mid 1980s, palaeontologists began to document the prints (some of which are shown).

        "article": "Politicians are criss-crossing the country wooing voters ahead of the election in 27 days\u2019 time. But in more than half of seats the result is already known, according to new analysis of safe seats. More than 25million live in constituencies where the result can already be predicted, because one party is so far ahead.\u00a0There are 650 seats up for grabs on May 7, with Labour and the Tories needing more than half to secure a majority. However, the Electoral Reform Society claims the result in 364 seats can be called now, based on current polls and how \u2018safe\u2019 they were in 2010. Scroll down for video . Some 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains . Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour\u2019s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands. The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories. Some parts of the country are more likely to play a role in deciding the outcome of the election than others. For example, 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains. The ERS has produced a new online tool for voters to see if they live in an area where the election result will be decided. It is campaigning for a change to the voting system, arguing that First Past The Post, where the winning candidate just needs to get the most votes, fails to take account of the changing face of British politics. Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour\u2019s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands.The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories . Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least \u00a070. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . The Tories need to win only 23 more seats to obtain a majority in the Commons, while Labour need 70.\u00a0The polls suggests it could take three or more parties to form a majority, including the SNP, Lib Dems, DUP, Greens and Ukip. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: \u2018The fact that we can firmly predict the outcome of over half of the seats being contested this May is a sorry indictment of our outdated voting system. \u201cThe average constituency hasn\u2019t changed hands since the 1960s, and some have been under the same party\u2019s control since the reign of Queen Victoria. This is a huge disincentive for people to get out there and vote, and for other parties to challenge incumbents. We have a system which actively discourages voters and parties from taking part. \u201cWe urgently need a fairer electoral system to give voice to the many millions of people in safe seats who are not being heard. \u201cPredicting the winners in a majority of seats shouldn\u2019t be possible in a truly dynamic and modern democracy. But sadly that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been able to do. The UK needs a fair voting system to bring our politics into the 21st century and give us a Parliament that actually reflects people\u2019s wishes.\u201d As part of the 2010 coalition agreement, the Lib Dems and Tories held a referendum on changing the voting system to the Alternative Vote, which allows voters to give their first and second choice of candidate. The winner is the first candidate to get over 50 per cent of the vote.\u00a0However, in the referendum in 2011 it was roundly defeated when 67.9 per cent voted against it.",

Executive editor Mitch Pugh said\u00a0reporters saw annual statistics which ranked South Carolina as the state where the most women are killed by men, according to The New York Times. 'The discussion around the table in the newsroom was why is that. We've written about it every year, but we've never done the deep dive.' The small newspaper's photographs were just one of many by news organizations which looked at the key news events which gripped the nation and international community over the past year. Some of the most vivid portraits came from the\u00a0New York Times which ran a series of heartbreaking images of the Ebola outbreak as it gripped countries in West Africa. The newspaper won three Pulitzer prizes for international reporting and feature photography for its coverage of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. The Pulitzer committee at Columbia University in New York said The New York Times staff shared the prize for international reporting for its coverage of the deadly Ebola epidemic in west Africa.

While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the\u00a0Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.",

        "article": "Australia's 'tiny hearts and balls of steel', it's apparently the perfect combination in dealing with asylum seeker boats, and a policy which could be copied by Britain, according to a British commentator. Controversial The Sun\u00a0columnist Katie Hopkins has heaped praise on Tony Abbott's government for its success in stopping the boats, which was a key election plank. But her backhanded compliments may not sit well with our policy-makers and social justice groups, in which she claimed Australia's strategy of 'threatening them with violence', was the way forward. 'It's time to get Australian,' she wrote. Scroll down for video . 'Threaten them with violence until they bugger off'. Controversial UK commentator Katie Hopkins has written that Australia's approach of having 'balls of steel and tiny hearts' should be followed as policy by the Brits . 'They (Australians) threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning' said Katie Hopkins . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been 'praised' for leading the charge to stop the boats . 'Their approach to migrant boats is the sort of approach we need in the Med. 'They threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning.' Her tone has won few friends in Europe and her timing, even less so, slammed as it coincided with the drowning of up to 900 men, women and children on a sunken fishing boat, off Italy. Hopkins went on to write: 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches.' 'Australians are like British people but with balls of steel, can-do brains, tiny hearts and whacking great gunships. 'And their approach is working. Migrant boats have halved in number since Prime Minister Tony Abbott got tough.' But her inflammatory remarks has led to an outcry on social media and tens of thousands joining a Change.org campaign to have her removed.

        "article": "Taylor Swift and rumored boyfriend Calvin Harris spotted together after watching the band HAIM perform at Troubadour Club in West Hollywood . Were a record company to write a job description for the next big thing in popular music, certain attributes would surely be high on the list. Foremost among them, one suspects, would be a decent singing voice, the ability to dance and that elusive brand of charisma which draws crowds of infatuated fans. None of which Calvin Harris possesses. Not that he will be the slightest bit concerned about it. Because he has plenty of reasons for self-confidence. Seventy million of them, in fact. That is the fortune the 31-year-old pop leviathan has amassed since bursting onto the scene eight years ago. No mean feat for an introspective and, by his own admission, curmudgeonly son of a biochemist from the Scottish Borders who less than a decade ago was stacking supermarket shelves to make ends meet. To put it into perspective, his \u00a370 million nest egg eclipses the fortunes of household names such as Kylie Minogue and Sir Cliff Richard. Yet walk into your local pub and it\u2019s a fair bet many people, unless they follow the charts, will never have heard of him. So how has a pasty-faced, gangly geek (he\u2019s 6ft 5in), who decided early in his career to eschew personal publicity altogether, turned into the biggest pop star in Britain? The numbers don\u2019t lie. His earning power is nothing short of breathtaking. Last year alone he earned \u00a345 million. For one night\u2019s work DJ-ing at a party in Puerto Rico, he was reportedly paid $1million. The year before he grossed \u00a330 million, making him comfortably the best paid DJ on the planet, and in the same year his credibility was bolstered by an Ivor Novello award for songwriter of the year. All of this has led to him being named the 21st most powerful celebrity on Forbes magazine\u2019s Celebrity 100, beating the likes of Gordon Ramsay, Simon Cowell and even J.K. Rowling. But the very word \u2018celebrity\u2019 flies in the face of everything Calvin Harris stands for. Fans of The X Factor might remember the occasion, in 2009, when the Scot invaded the show\u2019s stage during a performance by the lovably hopeless Irish twins, Jedward. Holding a pineapple on his head, he bent over and pointed at his buttocks \u2014 a bizarre performance which he later explained was a protest against the \u2018frightening stranglehold that Simon Cowell has got over the entire music chart in the UK at the moment\u2019. Protesting about The X Factor\u2019s obsession with fame, he declared: \u2018I\u2019m not a celebrity. I make music.\u2019 This underdog mentality undoubtedly stems from his background. He was born Adam Wiles in 1984 in Dumfries. His father, David, now 72, was the lead biochemist at the local hospital and his mother, Pamela, 65, had been an occupational therapist but became a full-time housewife after Adam was born. DJ Calvin Harris performs onstage in East Rutherford, New Jersey. In 2008 he stormed the stage at an X Factor stage performance to protest what he called the programme's obsession with fame . Two older siblings went on to become, respectively, an IT expert and a marketing executive. Adam, however, was cut from a different cloth. As a teenager, he underwent a dance music epiphany while listening to the radio in his bedroom. But instead of heading out to pursue the rock\u2019n\u2019roll cliche in pubs and clubs, the cerebral young man shut himself in his bedroom, where he built his own studio and spent the next eight years honing the production skills which would make his fortune. Soon his music making had become an obsession. He has said that he so rarely left his room that he experienced a personality change, becoming an anti-social electronic music geek, chained to a keyboard. Calvin Harris at the 2013 Ivor Novello awards held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London . There were stints in bands, but he made an awkward frontman, perpetually hiding behind an oversized pair of sunglasses and resolutely refusing to dance. Nobody was surprised when he gave that up. There were some encouraging signs. An independent record label released a couple of his tunes on vinyl. But he earned more money from the job he took in a fish factory, as well as shelf stacking at Marks & Spencer and Safeway. In 2003, he took a leap of faith and moved to London in an attempt to \u2018make it\u2019. He didn\u2019t, and was soon returning north with his tail between his legs. It was back in his bedroom studio that he recorded his first album, I Created Disco, by which time he had rechristened himself Calvin Harris. His salvation, as with so many recent stars, came in the form of social media. Calvin rapidly built a following for his music on MySpace, which brought him to the attention of EMI publishing and later the Sony BMG label. In the blink of an eye he was writing two of the tracks on Kylie Minogue\u2019s comeback album, X. That same year, 2007, he released his debut album, which went gold with more than 100,000 sales. Almost by accident, Calvin had found the solution to his problems: get somebody else, better looking, more famous and with a better voice, to sing his songs instead. So after I Created Disco, he packed up singing and retreated, gratefully, into the background. Since that first collaboration he has worked with anyone and everyone in the business, from popstars Rihanna (their 2011 smash hit We Found Love won him a Grammy) and Katy Perry to the British superstar Ellie Goulding. Even Cheryl Cole owes her biggest hit to Calvin. Along the way, he has released three more albums, all of which have been global smashes. Two years ago, he surpassed Michael Jackson to become the first artist to score nine top-ten hits from a single album. After his I Created Disco album (pictured), he packed up singing and retreated, gratefully, into the background . With such dizzying success it is impossible to keep a low profile for ever, and even Calvin has been affected by the fame juggernaut. It began with a sequence of beautiful girlfriends. Despite his ungainly appearance, he found himself squiring the Russian-American swimwear model Anne Vyalitsyna. Soon he was developing a reputation for becoming involved with his collaborators. Ellie Goulding was an on-off dalliance for years, and he had a year-long relationship with singer Rita Ora, which ended with a Twitter argument. And while success had built Calvin\u2019s confidence, it did nothing to dampen his contrary nature. Twitter spats (he has 5.79 million followers) have become his stock in trade. He has railed at unkind reviewers, \u2018rich kids\u2019 ruining the record industry, his tracks being sold for what he regards as derisory prices, and singers whom, he feels, do not treat his creations with sufficient respect. Calvin Harris had made a career working with some of the hottest stars in pop music, including Ellie Goulding (left) and Rihanna (right) All of which paints a less than complimentary picture of a petulant star whose life has changed beyond recognition. Earlier this year, he jettisoned another stunning model, the American Aarika Wolf, in favour of the biggest prize of his dating career, American pop princess Taylor Swift. Miss Swift, a 25-year-old global star who had the top-selling album of 2014 in the U.S., fits the 2015 vintage Calvin to perfection \u2014 for since 2013 he\u2019s gone about reinventing himself from the ground up. No longer a the anorak-loving teenager from Dumfries, Harris owns an \u00a311 million mansion in Beverly Hills . That was the year he signed a deal to DJ at the American superclub Hakkasan, taking up a residency in Las Vegas and buying an \u00a311 million mansion in Beverly Hills. In less than a decade he has gone from a nondescript detached house on the Georgetown housing estate just outside Dumfries, to a mansion with ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, two swimming pools and a guesthouse so palatial it comes with its own private garage. Such is his earning power, however, this is a drop in the ocean. Last year, he became the first artist to have his music streamed over a billion times on the internet and, at the rate he is going, the DJ will have \u00a3250 million in the bank before he hits 40. The Hakkasan gig alone earns him \u00a3200,000 a night, while he has been paid many millions more by brands who use his music in advertising campaigns. He has physically changed beyond recognition as well. His once pasty skin is tanned, while endless gym sessions have honed those spindly limbs to lean, muscled perfection. The chest is waxed, the hair and designer stubble coiffed daily by a personal groomer, the teeth whitened and straightened and his wardrobe overhauled by a stylist. The end result of all this has been a contract as the face and body of Emporio Armani. No longer the self-conscious wallflower, he now poses in nothing but a pair of briefs without missing a beat. He became the biggest thing in music by stealth, but the days of Calvin Harris flying under the radar are a thing of the past.",

        "article": "A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack\u00a0involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.",

The die-hard contingent of fans who travel the length and breadth of the country to watch Brendan Rodgers' side are staying away from The KC Stadium after Hull City charged Liverpool fans \u00a350 for their sets. Last season, the same seats were sold for \u00a335. That price has caused outrage, given that Stoke fans were charged \u00a316 for tickets when they went to Hull in August and Evertonians were charged \u00a335 for seats at The KC Stadium in December. Liverpool fans (seen here at Arsenal) are unhappy at being charge \u00a350 to go to Hull . Liverpool fans are planning a protest a the Hull game over the rising cost of tickets . To put the price of seats at the KC stadium into context, tickets for the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley were available for \u00a333. Liverpool fans have been amongst the most vociferous railing at the spiralling costs and have regularly held up banners at stadiums saying they are 'against modern football'. A statement on the Spirit of Shankly fans' website said: 'We would encourage fans to join us on that night to tell the money men of the Premier League cartel that they cannot continue to charge exorbitant prices, whilst making obscene amounts of money. 'This wealth should be shared and passed back to the lifeblood of the game, the supporters\u2026 We will no longer accept these prices when there is more money in the sport than ever before.' Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said at his press conference on Monday: 'I have been made aware of the issue. Fans work hard to get money so they can attend these games. I respect the supporters' right to protest.' Hull boss Steve Bruce has also called for Barclays Premier League officials to act to curb rising ticket prices after admitting he felt sorry for football fans. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he\u00a0respects the supporters' right to protest . Bruce said: 'I feel sorry for the supporters of big clubs who have to dig deep every week and I hope when the new TV money comes into play the Premier League can remember football does belong to supporters. 'I know how difficult it is for people here at our club to find the money to bring their two kids to a football match and we have to make sure with all the money washing around we give something back to the fans. 'We have to remember the average man in the street because they are the lifeblood of football and I think if the Premier League set certain rules we would all have to abide by them.'",

        "article": "Banned: Joseph Getty was caught driving his Range Rover through Belgrave Square while drunk . A member of the ultra-wealthy Getty family was today banned from driving after being caught behind the wheel of his Range Rover while double the legal drinking limit. Joseph Getty, 26, pleaded guilty to drink-driving and received a 20-month ban as well as a fine of \u00a31,000, which he paid immediately. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Getty had 83 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath when he was stopped while driving through Belgrave Square, near his west London home, two weeks ago. His conviction came just a day after his relative Andrew Getty was found dead at his Hollywood home having suffered a 'traumatic injury to the rectal area'. The court was told that Getty, who is a director of the jewellery company run by his wife Sabine Ghanem, earns \u00a340,000 a year as a financial analyst and was given a \u00a396,000 bonus last year. Prosecutor Kate Shilton told the court Getty was stopped just after 11pm on March 17, and had difficulty walking. 'He was stopped due to the manner of the driving, and officers could smell alcohol on his breath', she said. 'Mr Getty got out of the car and appeared unsteady on his feet. He had to be helped on to the footpath by the officers.' Rebecca Lee, defending, said Getty had made a 'stupid decision' to drive home from an evening celebrating his wedding with friends who lived less than a mile away. 'The friends hadn't been able to come to his wedding, they offered him a glass of wine and he agreed, she said. 'It was at home, a large glass, and maybe the glasses were topped up without close attention being paid to how much exactly was being drunk. 'He just didn't think, it was half a mile to drive home and that's what he did. He wishes he could turn the clock back but he can't.' Socialite: Getty with Princess Beatrice, centre, and his jewellery designer wife Sabine Ghanem, right . The court heard that Getty had previously given up drinking in a bid to lose weight. 'It was pretty unusual on this evening that he had taken alcohol,' Ms Lee said. Magistrate Paul Brookes said: 'Mr Getty, until today you were a man of good character and unfortunately you will lose your good character. 'In your own words it was a very stupid thing to do, but it was more than stupid - it was dangerous.' He was disqualified from driving for 20 months and ordered to pay a fine of \u00a31,000, costs of \u00a385 and a surcharge of \u00a3120. Ms Lee told the court: 'He offers his very sincere apologies for driving when he had taken alcohol. 'He very much regrets doing that and understands it was wrong. He recognises he made a serious error in judgement and it is behaviour he does not intend to repeat. 'He is acutely conscious of the effect on his wife and family, he knows they will be very disappointed with him and extremely angry with him for doing something so stupid.' Tragic: Andrew Getty has been found dead at his mansion in Hollywood, naked from the waste down . Ancestors: Joseph Getty is great-grandson of J. Paul Getty, left, and grandson of Sir John Paul Getty, right . Getty is the son of Mark Getty, the founder of leading photographic agency Getty Images, and the grandson of philanthropist Sir John Paul Getty. The Getty dynasty was started by J. Paul Getty, Joseph's great-grandfather, who became the richest man in the world thanks to the Getty Oil Company and went on to set up a number of acclaimed art institutions, despite being a notorious miser. But the super-rich family has been touched by tragedy, most recently when Andrew Getty - son of John Paul's brother Gordon - died after years of drug-taking and hard partying. He was found unconscious in his mansion, naked from the waste down and suffering from a brutal injury to his 'rectal area', according to the authorities. Sir John Paul Getty, who died in 2003, was an Anglophile who became a British citizen and built a replica of The Oval cricket ground at his country estate in Buckinghamshire, Wormsley Park. But he also suffered family tragedy as his second wife Talitha died of a heroin overdose, and his son John Paul Getty III was kidnapped in Rome. The family thought that John Paul III was faking his own kidnapping until his ear was cut off and sent to them. He was left paralysed after a drug overdose led to a stroke, and he died four years ago at the age of 54.",

        "article": "Ronald Koeman held a meeting with Southampton's players to refocus their minds on European qualification after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend is arguably Saints' biggest match of their season, with former manager Mauricio Pochettino returning to St Mary's for the first time since leaving for Tottenham in the summer. Just a point and a place separate Koeman's men from Spurs in sixth, although this season's surprise success has brought with it speculation that players will exit much like last summer. Ronald Koeman held a meeting with Southampton's players to refocus their minds on European qualification . Victor Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at move to Arsenal . Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez have all been linked with a move away, while Wanyama was quoted on Thursday claiming Arsenal were interested in his services. The Kenyan denied making those comments in subsequently deleted Twitter posts - an incident which proved the catalyst to Koeman sitting his squad down on Thursday morning. 'I spoke to Victor this morning,' Koeman said. 'We had a meeting with all the players because what we need is now to really have the focus on the last five games. We play for a European position on the table. 'We have a massive game this Saturday and no interest in talking about rumours in the press about future and contracts and have the focus on the football side. 'That's difficult but it's not true what they put in the press and I believe the player. Koeman spoke to Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five Premier League games . Morgan Schneiderlin has been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham in another Saints firesale . 'It's a good signal for everybody that we have to be focused to the football side and not about the contracts. I do not answer any more questions about player's contracts and the focus on the last five games.' Koeman called the Wanyama story 'bulls***' in a separate interview and the midfielder later posted on Twitter to clarify the situation. 'Sorry - was caught off guard this morning about a story that I hadn't read,' he said.

        "article": "Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A\u00a0study\u00a0reported in the British Medical Journal found that\u00a090 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access:\u00a0Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower\u00a0rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures\u00a0come\u00a0just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary \u2013 costing the NHS \u00a3290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a \u2018self-treatable condition\u2019. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'",

        "article": "Boston (CNN)When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller's cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let's get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev's relatives arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it's not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, \"Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!\" he testified. Amid the stench of \"burning hair, blood, sulfur,\" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. \"I was completely terrified because I didn't know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,\" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. \"I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,\" he said. \"I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was.\" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a \"puddle of chaos and blood and glass,\" her instinct was to run. But she couldn't. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. \"I saw blood pouring out of my foot,\" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. \"It was probably the hardest decision I've had to make,\" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. \"I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,\" he testified, adding that he remembered \"a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets.\" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, \"Oh, s***, he's on fire!\" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn't remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. \"So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,\" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday's testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3\u00bd feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI's re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It's highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, \"Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain.\" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden's son, Leo, to safety. \"I saw Martin's face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,\" he said, . Martin's hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin's torso, \"I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,\" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, \"please\" and \"Martin\" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard's back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs. CNN's Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.",

        "article": "It has been linked to deaths across the country and left others critically ill. Now New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued a state health alert that the synthetic marijuana product known as 'Spice' is sweeping the city, and that 160 people have been hospitalized in nine days after using the drug. Over 120 of those people were admitted to Emergency Rooms in the same week. The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over-the-counter as incense or potpourri. State health alert: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday  that 'Spice', also known as 'K2' or 'Mojo', is sweeping the city, with 160 people admitted to hospital in the nine days from April 8, 120 of them in one week . 'Synthetic drugs are anything but harmless, and this rash of severe health emergencies across the state is direct proof,' Governor Cuomo said, according to The Hudson Valley News Network. 'We banned synthetic marijuana, bath salts and similar substances to avoid the disastrous results that occur \u2013 and as law enforcement and health officials continue to crack down on the use and sale of these drugs in New York, we are today issuing a health alert as a warning amidst this surge in hospitalizations.' Symptoms can range from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. 'Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,' New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez told KOCO. 'They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.' But the same problem is occurring all over the U.S. Critically ill: This photo shows Jeff Stallings, who was placed in medically-induced coma alongside his older brother, Joey, after taking synthetic marijuana on APril 6 in his hometown of McComb, Mississippi . On life support: The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill earlier this month after smoking the drug, a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. Above, Joey . Dangerous:\u00a0The cannabinoid, also commonly called 'K2' or 'Mojo', is predominantly abused by teenagers and typically sold over the counter as incense or potpourri . Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise in Spcie usage and said there had been 98 overdoses in the previous month. Synthetic marijuana a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to traditional marijuana. It is nicknamed Spice, Mojo, K2, Yucatan Fire, Solar Flare and Bliss, among other things. The drug is typically smoked by users. It does not give positive results in tests for cannabis. Because the herbs and chemicals in synthetic marijuana vary, it is impossible for users to know what they are smoking. They also cannot tell what concentrations they are taking - which can lead to fatal overdoses. Unlike pot, Spice can cause a huge range of symptoms, many of which can be severe. These include tremors, paranoia, seizures, vomiting, hallucinations, chest pain, cardiac problems, kidney damage and brain damage. Meanwhile in Mississippi, there were 97 cases over eight days in April, according to CNN. Two of these Mississippi cases were Jeff and Joey Stallings, brothers who were hospitalized April 6 after smoking Spice. The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill  after smoking the drug, which is a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. They were hospitalized within hours of each other, when they collapsed after suffering from hallucinations, vomiting, night sweats and violent shaking. They had to be put on life support. Fortunately both were able to fight for their lives and were allowed home on April 13. Jeff Stallings, however, has suffered permanent kidney damage. Last year, California teenager Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Connor, 19, fell asleep after taking the drug. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. He was declared brain dead at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach hours later. A deadly case: Last year, California teen Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Above, Connor is pictured brain dead, surrounded by his family, shortly before his organs were donated . 'He gave into (peer pressure) - thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe - and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor\u2019s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA at the time. Doctors were unable to detect spice in Connor's system - there is no way to trace its everchanging components. However, they knew he had taken it after finding the package of the drug in his pocket. Connor's family donated his organs after his death, in accordance with the teenager's wishes. They later created a Facebook page to warn others about the perils of synthetic marijuana. 'Connor Eckhardt died after taking ONE HIT of synthetic marijuana (SPICE, K2, POTpourri). This dangerous substance is legal. Help us save lives by sharing,' read a post on the page.",

        "article": "A teenage girl has suffered serious injuries after falling 200ft from a cliff at a campsite - in front of her horrified father. The 15-year-old girl, named locally as Leah Price from the Nottingham area, was airlifted to hospital last night from the Blue Dolphin camping site near Filey, North Yorkshire.\u00a0It is believed she lost her footing on the cliffs. A retired woman who owns a caravan near the cliff has said she heard crying and shouting before she rushed outside. Tragedy: The cliffs at Filey where a 15-year-old girl, named locally as Leah Price, \u00a0fell. She was airlifted to hospital  with serious injuries. Police say it is believed she may have been sat on the cliff edge with a friend . She said: 'A man, who I think was her dad, was in such a hurry to get to the cliff that he flew passed our van in a great big transit van and nearly tore the corner off our van. 'I could hear crying and shouting, so I went outside to see what was happening. I could hear crying in a van, it was such a drama. 'It happened right at the back of our caravan. We back onto the field and then there is the cliff edge. We first thought that somebody had thrown themselves over. 'Where she went over it was a bit of a slope whereas further up it is more of a sheer drop.' The holidaymaker said coastguards arrived within ten minutes and there was a scene of over a dozen emergency service people on the field. She said: 'It was still daylight and we were thinking \"please find her before the light goes\". The coastguard was shining their headlights over the cliff and a helicopter came and swept around and went to the sea. 'Others were hammering things into the ground to attach ropes to. A lot of dog walkers walk on the path called Cleveland Way where she had been walking. 'It is a couple of feet from the path to the cliff. I don't know why she was walking so close to the edge. I hope that this will mean they put fences up, especially where the vans are.' Camping site: The cliffs where the girl fell are near the Blue Dolphin Holiday Park in North Yorkshire. Her father was said to have witnessed the incident and alerted the emergency services . The coastguard has revealed that the call to emergency services was made by the girl's father who witnessed his teenage daughter 'accidentally falling over a cliff edge'. The incident happened before 8pm and North Yorkshire Police and the coastguard were dispatched to the scene within ten minutes. A lifeboat crew was also called out to the scene in Filey but was not needed as the girl landed on land and not in the sea. It is not clear how the girl, who was taken to hospital in Hull, came to fall from the cliff but a spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said it was believed she may have been sitting at the cliff edge with a friend. The force confirmed this morning that the girl was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with head injuries and police say she is in a critical but stable condition. The Blue Dolphin site is run by Haven, described on its website as 'Britain's largest provider of domestic holidays with family holiday parks around the UK'. A spokesman for the holiday park said: 'Leah's father alerted our security team immediately after his daughter's fall from the cliff path. 'The coastguard and police, assisted by a Sea King helicopter, were quickly on the scene. 'We are continuing to offer assistance to Leah's family and friends through this difficult and painful time.' Another holidaymaker who owns a van at the site said: 'I think they were on holiday here. Nobody knows them so I don't think they own a van here. 'It makes my stomach to turn over to think that somebody's child went over the cliff.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said this afternoon: 'We can now advise that the girl who fell from the cliff at Filey on the night of April 9 is from the Nottingham area. 'She remains in a critical but stable condition in Hull Royal Infirmary.' A spokesman for The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'The UK Coastguard were contacted on Thursday evening by a father who witnessed his teenage daughter accidentally falling over a cliff edge. 'Coastguard Rescue Teams training nearby were able to get on scene within ten minutes. 'Specially trained cliff technicians were able to descend to the girl and administer first aid until the Coastguard rescue helicopter arrived on scene.'",

But while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control, one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol, a survey found. A new poll laying bare the public's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out, compared to a fifth of the general population. It also revealed the risky effects of drinking, as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home, driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated. One in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a dirnking problem, a survey found . The news comes after a shocking report published this week found binge drinking costs the British economy \u00a34.9bn every year in terms of treating drunks in A&E, road crashes, police arrests and court cases. The damning report said current policies on alcohol taxation are failing to keep up with the financial consequences of people drinking to excess, and calls for minimum unit prices to offset these costs. The new poll of 4,000 British adults found 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem. Among young professionals, this figure rose to 21 per cent, with 28 per cent of men in this saying they believe they have a problem. More than a third (35 per cent) of 18 to 24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, with one in five (18 per cent) admitting they have not been able to recall how they got home. One in 20 admitted to driving themselves home drunk and one in ten said they have got in a car with someone who they knew was intoxicated. A survey of 4,000 British adults revealed: . 7 per cent reported they have a drinking problem . 21 per cent of young professionals said they had a drinking professionals, with the figure rising to 28 per cent for men alone . 35 per cent of 18-24-year-olds said they had got so drunk they could not remember most of their night out, . 18 per cent admitted they have not been able to recall how they got home . 5 per cent admitted to driving themselves home drunk . 10 per cent got in a car with someone intoxicated . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house . 23 per cent of 35-54-year-olds said they drink at home alone . Another 23 per cent considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking . 53 per cent said the NHS should refrain from treating alcoholics . 54 per cent said it is not acceptable to drink when pregnant . Among 25 to 34-year-olds 16 per cent said they have woken up in a stranger's house. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of those aged 35 to 54 said they drink alone at home, with many saying they do it to relieve stress or relax. When asked about the dangers of drinking, three quarters of those polled said they believed Britain has a heavy drinking culture. Just over a fifth (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking. While a sizeable proportion of people admitted to problematic drinking, the survey revealed tough attitudes to alcohol abuse. More than half of those questioned believe the NHS should refrain from treating people who continue to abuse alcohol after warnings about their health. A similar number (54 per cent) said it is not acceptable to drink while pregnant. Alistair Bohm, head of communications at drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction, said: 'Problems with alcohol use can affect people of any age, from any background. 'As these statistics show, it's not just people who are addicted to alcohol who are damaging their health or risking their safety as a result of drinking. 'If a person is worried about their drinking, the best thing to do is speak to their doctor, or find their nearest addiction services.' The World Health Organisation estimates there are 3.3 million deaths each year as a result of harmful use of alcohol. Doctors warn long term alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for conditions including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and certain cancers. The survey was carried out by Opinium Research. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) considered alcohol to be more harmful to their health than smoking .",

The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 \u2013 the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations and seven times higher than France\u2019s 0.4 per cent. According to an International Monetary Fund report, this was enough for Britain to leapfrog socialist France and become the second most powerful economy in Europe, behind Germany. The UK is expected to cement its position in the coming years as one of the fastest growing major economies in the West. The IMF is forecasting \u2018solid\u2019 growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016. Scroll down for video . The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 \u2013 the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations . Despite a slight downgrade for 2016 \u2013 the IMF\u2019s initial forecast was 2.4 per cent \u2013 this is still enough for Britain to leave other EU nations trailing in its wake. Output in France is forecast to expand by 1.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year, while Germany is set to grow by 1.6 per cent then 1.7 per cent. Within the G7, only the US is expected to perform better than Britain. \u2018In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth,\u2019 the IMF said. The World Economic Outlook report, which was published yesterday, will be seen as a boost for the Conservatives ahead of next month\u2019s General Election. The Fund also appeared to back Tory plans to return Britain to the black after years of borrowing and rising debt. It will come as another blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who has pledged to bring traditionally Left-wing policies back to Britain \u2013 mirroring the actions of Francois Hollande in France. The French president swept to power in 2012 promising to take on the rich and big business, but the country\u2019s economy has been in a rut ever since. Unemployment in France is 10.6 per cent compared to 5.7 per cent in Britain.

        "article": "As one might imagine, Rafa Benitez's arrival at Stamford Bridge as interim manager in 2012 came as quite a slap in the face to Chelsea fans still hurting from Roberti Di Matteo's untimely departure just months after winning the Champions League. This was a man who had beaten the Blues in two Champions League semi-finals with drab defensive tactics - meaning that a sub-standard Liverpool side reached two finals, while Jose Mourinho's team of world class individuals missed out. As expected, we didn't warm to Rafa when he walked out for his first game at the Bridge. He had made a number of derogatory comments about the club during his Liverpool days and was rightly given a frosty reception. Rafa Benitez is set to leave Napoli this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services . Benitez was made Chelsea interim manager in 2012 but it's fair to say the fans never warmed to him . Cody Taylor is a fan writer on 90min.com . He did little to bring the support on-side in his the first few weeks either. Chelsea drew Benitez's first two games 0-0, before a 3-1 defeat against West Ham in a London derby - embarrassing. The only thing is, in the end he managed to get the job done and it would be the same for another club today. Rafa never liked being called the 'interim' manager, in fact he made a point of letting people know the title irked him, but he was brought in on a mission to keep the club on course until the end of the season. It wasn't pretty, but that was exactly what he did. Rafa also managed to get a better return from Fernando Torres - a player that was pretty much useless at Chelsea before and after. The season even ended with another European trophy. People often forget that in 2011/12 Chelsea finished 6th in the Premier League - the lowest in 10 years - a fact conveniently masked by two cup wins. In 2012/13 Rafa ensured Chelsea finished 3rd and got an automatic pass back into the Champions League group stage when there was big pressure from Arsenal and Tottenham. As Chelsea fans, we certainly didn't like him, but looking back we hate to think what might have happened without him. Benitez got the best out of his squad for the rest of the season and he got the best out of Fernando Torres . Chelsea won the Europa League in 2013 under Rafa Benitez after beating Benfica in Amsterdam . One Chelsea fan thanks Benitez for his efforts on the last day of the season in 2013 at Stamford Bridge . The rumours are that he could now be on for a return to the Premier League - he knows English football inside out and would actually be perfect for several clubs. Manchester City is one possible destination - he'd probably do a similar interim job there while they wait for Pep Guardiola - and Newcastle is another. The reality is that while Rafa possibly wouldn't be a popular choice at either, he would give both clubs exactly what they need. City require an experienced and pragmatic stop-gap that knows how to keep things ticking over until they can land their superstar. Newcastle need someone who can get the best out of a talented group of players that are significantly underachieving at this moment in time. In that respect Rafa certainly made sure Liverpool punched above their weight. People don't like to admit it, but he's a good manager and probably deserves his chance in the Premier League again.",
        "highlights": "Rafa Benitez's contract at Napoli expires this summer and he is set to leave .\nManchester City, West Ham and Newcastle could be looking for a new boss .\nBenitez was a success at Liverpool, but struggled to win over Chelsea fans .\nBut he still won the Europa League with the Blues and they are thankful .\nHe would bring success to almost any Premier League team next season .",

        "article": "No other scoreline could have emphasised how seriously this new Arsenal team are taking their prospects of winning major trophies again. 'One-nil to the Arsenal' used to be commonplace before Arsene Wenger arrived and made everything more exciting, and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at Burnley with a first-half goal from Aaron Ramsey. It was Arsenal's eighth win in a row, their best run since the Invincibles team in 2004, and kept the pressure on Chelsea, who they meet in their next league game at the Emirates. Only once before this season have Arsenal won 1-0 but striker Olivier Giroud feels the hard-fought victory proved there is more to this current Wenger team than pass-pass-pass and dissolve when the going gets tough. In other words, they are built to last. Olivier Giroud wants Arsenal to continue their Premier League winning streak and challenge for the title . 'You can't play your best football every game. We tried to be focused on not conceding and it's one more clean sheet,' Giroud said proudly. 'As long as we were winning the game I don't think we were in too much danger. We are really pleased. 'If we had been told we would win this game 1-0 I would have signed for it straight away. Burnley played really tough against us. It was a big fight. 'We know about the record of the Invincibles. It's really good for us to be near that and I'm really proud to take part. But we don't want to stop here. We want to carry on and keep this good run going until the end.' Aaron Ramsey's 12th-minute strike was enough for Arsenal to earn a 1-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday . The win was Arsenal's eighth in a row and they kept up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea . If Arsenal manage that, Jose Mourinho might have a far tighter finish to the title race than he could have anticipated a couple of months ago. Wenger has even found his own Claude Makelele in 23-year-old Frenchman Francis Coquelin who sat in front of the back-four and kept Burnley's chances to a minimum on Saturday. Club legend Thierry Henry even gave him a new nickname 'The Detective' for the way he sensed danger and snuffed it out. 'I always knew I could do a job for the team. I just needed a chance to show it,' said Coquelin, who was sent loan to Charlton earlier this season. It's ironic that having preached the beautiful game for nearly two decades Wenger has finally found a couple of warriors in Laurent Koscielny and Coquelin that hark back to the Tony Adams era. Arsene Wenger's side face Chelsea in their next home game and have an FA Cup semi-final to look forward to . Even if they can't catch Chelsea this time they will fancy a proper tilt at the Premier League next season and by then they might be back-to-back FA Cup winners. They won the trophy last May and face Reading in another semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. 'We have a better balance in the team,' Wenger said. 'Coquelin contributes to that, Hector Bellerin has come into the team and big players like Koscielny, Giroud and (Mesut) Ozil were out for four months in the season. People forget that. 'I also have a quality bench and quality players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mathieu Debuchy who didn't travel. We have a big squad and I think we have quality.' Francis Coquelin was praised for his performance in midfield with Thierry Henry calling him 'the detective' 360 - days since Arsenal's last 1-0 away win in the Premier League. That was in March 2014 against Tottenham when Tomas Rosicky scored the winner. The Arsenal manager is playing down chances of overtaking Chelsea: 'We have to be perfect' \u2013 but the Emirates will still be buzzing in a fortnight when the top two clash. For Burnley, it will be matches against Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in the next five weeks that determine their Premier League survival prospects rather than this result. Striker Ashley Barnes, who was twice denied an equaliser by goalkeeper David Ospina, said: 'If we could have got something against Arsenal it would have been a bonus. But we get cracking again next weekend against Everton.' The return of Matt Taylor as a late substitute was also a boost for the Clarets. Taylor has missed eight months with an achilles injury but his experience will be extremely valuable in the run-in.",

        "article": "Antiquities looted from ancient temples and Buddhist sites in India have been found on display at the Honolulu Museum of Art after a tourist spotted they were sourced from an art dealer facing charges in India. The museum yesterday handed over seven rare artifacts in its possession after authorities found, to the shock of museum officials, that they had been smuggled into the U.S. by former New York art dealer Subhash Kapoor. Agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will take the items back to New York and, from there, eventually return them to the government of India. Marc Thomas, chief preparator at the Honolulu Museum of Art, holds one of seven stolen artifacts that were on display in the museum's collection . The artifacts are believed to have been smuggled into the U.S. by an art dealer facing charges in India . The items' origin was discovered after a tourist visiting the museum noticed the dealer, Subhash Kapoor, was listed as their source . Dealer Kapoor, was arrested in 2011 and is awaiting trial in India. Officials say he created false provenances for the antiquities. The discovery was made after a visitor last year recognized the name of Kapoor's New York gallery as the source of a 2,000-year-old terra cotta rattle and contacted authorities, said Stephan Jost, the museum's director. Museum officials then pored over their records and determined six other Indian items had ties to Kapoor. He said Kapoor donated one of the items and sold five to the museum, while one was a gift from someone else. Agents are hailing the Honolulu museum for being the first U.S. institution to publicly and easily cooperate with the investigation, dubbed 'Operation Hidden Idol,' involving four arrests and the recovery of thousands of pieces worth a total of $150 million. 'Owning stolen stuff is not part of our mission,' Mr Jost said. 'I'm not sure we've done anything heroic. We just want to do the right thing.' Mr Jost watched as agents inspected the items - the rattle, figurines, architectural fragments and tiles - and them hauled them in packed crates into a truck. The items were found to have been sourced from Subhash Kapoor (pictured), who is facing charges in India . Brenton Easter, a special agent for Homeland Security, inspects the artifacts in the basement of the Honolulu Museum of Art . This tile is believed to have been looted from a religious temple or ancient Buddhist site in India . They have now been packed up and sent to New York, from where they will be returned to India's government . Martinez stressed there was no culpability on the museum's part, as it wasn't aware of the items' provenance when it acquired them between 1991 and 2003. Mr Jost said American art museums are becoming more rigorous in vetting the history of objects they acquire. 'Could we have done a better job? Sure,' he said. 'Were we a victim? Yes.' Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Brenton Easter said it was not uncommon for unsavory dealers to donate ill-gotten items for tax benefits and other reasons. Mr Easter is part of a group of agents in New York that focus on cultural property crime whose work includes dismantling the organizations behind the crimes and repatriating the seized pieces. Some institutions are reluctant to come forward, partly because of the financial loss involved, he said. It's very rare for evidence to come to light to show a museum has items that were illegally obtained, said James Cuno, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust. An item looted from India is wrapped up in packaging before being sent back to India . The stunning antiquities were sourced from art dealer Subhash Kapoor, who is facing charges in India . 'Claims might come from time to time. But most often those claims are based on just interest or the construction of national identity,' he said. 'If evidence is provided that's convincing, no museum will resist.' He cited an example from about 10 years ago when Italian police uncovered evidence revealing a number of items that were improperly removed from Italy. The U.S. museums where some of the items ended up returned them, he said. Repatriation has become more common in the past couple of decades, said Malcom Bell, a professor of Greek and Roman art and archaeology at the University of Virginia. As a general rule of thumb, museums and art collectors avoid purchasing items exported without clear and valid documentation before 1970 - the year of a United Nations cultural agreement targeting trafficking in antiquities, he said. 'Transparency is important, and if the Honolulu museum has been open, that's probably to be applauded,' Bell said. Kapoor sold six of the items to the museum and donated another, while the seventh was gifted by a second individual . Homeland Security officials remove the looted antiquities from storage at the Honolulu Museum of Art .",

        "article": "A teacher who was suspended for allowing her class to write 'get well soon' letters to a convicted police killer claims the children wanted to send notes to him. Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer\u00a0Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to\u00a0philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College who delivered the letters said they had made Abu-Jamal 'smile' and 'chuckle.'",

Beforehand he also tweeted: 'I've never actually seen #StarWars but the fact that the bad guy was all black and ate watermelons was unbelievably racist even for the 70's.' And appearing on the show he started off by saying that the old Star Wars films are full of social problems 'rooted in homophobia and casual racial sterotypes'.

Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December. As she lay dead on the floor, the father-of-two called two more vice girls over to his family home and raped them before they managed to flee while still naked. His young son was asleep in the bedroom next door while he carried out the horrific crimes. Mathieson, who has previously been described as of 'impeccable character', pleaded guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow today and now faces life in prison.

The court heard how the crimes occurred while he was left babysitting his young children while their mother - his partner of 10 years - enjoyed a night out. The family had spent the day Christmas shopping on December 4 last year and enjoyed a meal before returning home. Mathieson - described as being his 'normal self' - then dropped one of his children at his grandmother's home before returning to his house \u2013 in a quiet residential neighbourhood - with his younger son. His partner left the property for a work night out and he sent her a text which said: 'Have a good night. Love you'. However, soon after he had put their young son to bed, Mathieson used his phone to arrange for sex while his partner was out. The court heard he regularly used sex phone lines but hid it from his long-term partner. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was one of the escorts who arranged to meet him. The 23-year-old, who had arrived in Scotland just a few days earlier having moved up from London, arrived at his property at about 11pm. However, within minutes, Mathieson \u2013 who was high on cocaine - stabbed her 44 times and cut her throat. Mathieson then sent a text to his partner which said: 'Sorry xx'. His young child was asleep in the room next door while he carried out the harrowing crimes. The court heard how Ms Maurer had defensive-type injuries suggesting she had tried to fend off her killer. Two other escorts, who Mathieson had summoned, then arrived at his home, completely oblivious to the murder which had taken place. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was stabbed 44 times by\u00a0Mathieson and had her throat cut . When they arrived, they found Mathieson casually sitting on his sofa in the living room before he led them upstairs. Describing the horror that then met them, prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: 'Mathieson went into the bedroom first. 'He put on the light and hung back at the door whilst the women walked in. 'As soon as they entered the bedroom, they saw the deceased, lying on her back and on top of the double bed.' Mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door. One of the women begged Mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away, the court heard. He initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands. Miss Farquharson: 'He told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him. 'In fear of what he might do and, with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them, each did as they were told.' Mathieson went on to rape the pair, aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside Ms Maurer's dead body. The pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs. Once there, Mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again. Miss Farquharson said: 'Over the course of the assault in the living room, he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs. 'He appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both: 'I'm going to be many years in prison because I killed that girl. 'I've done this to show my wife something.' Mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and, sensing an opportunity to escape, the women ran for the door. Mathieson tried to chase them, striking one on the leg with a knife, but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid. Miss Farquharson: 'Both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help. They were crying and appeared to be terrified.' After the women escaped, Mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator: 'I've been high on drugs and I've killed a prostitute. 'Tell the officers I am not aggressive. I'm sitting on the couch. I had two other girls, but I've let them go.' Mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up. He got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him. Mathieson, a car sales manager, carried out the horrific crimes at his home in\u00a0Falkirk,\u00a0Stirlingshire (above), while his partner went on a work night out. He is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape . His partner, clueless as to what had happened in her absence, arrived back at the family property at about 2am. She was described as being 'hysterical' upon learning what had happened. Mathieson, a sales manager, was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month. His court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick. In what is rarely seen in court, his QC Donald Findlay left his own seat to sit beside Mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued. The court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes, but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor. In the spring of last year, he had started attending Cocaine Anonymous having built up a large debt. His girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed, the court heard. Mr Findlay, defending, said that before his crimes Mathieson had been of 'impeccable character', but said he now accepted 'full responsibility' for his actions. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentencing until May 7. Speaking after the hearing, detective inspector Dave Pinkney, from Police Scotland, said: 'The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults. 'Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. 'Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences. 'I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation. 'While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson's actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.'",

        "article": "(CNN)A top al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader -- who a few years ago was in a U.S. detention facility -- was among five killed in an airstrike in Yemen, the terror group said, showing the organization is vulnerable even as Yemen appears close to civil war. Ibrahim al-Rubaish died Monday night in what AQAP's media wing, Al-Malahem Media, called a \"crusader airstrike.\"  The Al-Malahem Media obituary characterized al-Rubaish as a religious scholar and combat commander. A Yemeni Defense Ministry official and two Yemeni national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that al-Rubaish had been killed, but could not specify how he died. Al-Rubaish was once held by the U.S. government at its detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In fact, he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then-President George W. Bush to challenge the legality of their confinement in Gitmo. He was eventually released as part of Saudi Arabia's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists, a program that U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, characterized as \"a failure.\" In December 2009, Sessions listed al-Rubaish among those on the virtual \" 'Who's Who' of al Qaeda terrorists on the Arabian peninsula ... who have either graduated or escaped from the program en route to terrorist acts.\" The United States has been active in Yemen, working closely with governments there to go after AQAP leaders like al-Rubaish. While it was not immediately clear how he died, drone strikes have killed many other members of the terrorist group. Yemen, however, has been in disarray since Houthi rebels began asserting themselves last year. The Shiite minority group even managed to take over the capital of Sanaa and, in January, force out Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- who had been a close U.S. ally in its anti-terror fight. Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader, and he is working with a Saudi-led military coalition to target Houthis and supporters of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Meanwhile, Yemen has been awash in violence and chaos -- which in some ways has been good for groups such as AQAP. A prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners, including some senior AQAP figures, according to a senior Defense Ministry official, and the United States pulled the last of its special operations forces out of Yemen last month, which some say makes things easier for AQAP.

        "article": "The panel that cleared Inverness defender Josh Meekings to play in the William Hill Scottish Cup final did not even consider his handball, the Scottish Football Association has revealed. Meekings saw his cup-final ban thrown out by a judicial panel tribunal on Thursday after Caley Thistle challenged his one-game suspension for denying Celtic an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberate handball. And it has emerged the Highland club's lawyers successfully argued that SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan had no right to bring the case because match officials had seen the incident where Meekings stopped a Leigh Griffiths header during his side's 3-2 win over Celtic on Sunday. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . The SFA published the reasons given by the chair of the three-man panel. They read: 'Further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings' solicitor. 'In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. 'The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory . 'It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.' The decision could effectively blunt the SFA's powers to bring retrospective cases against players, unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials. Players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties. The rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending-off offences 'not seen by match officials'. The Meekings case was brought because referee Steven McLean and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender's hand. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory. He said: 'I think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country, players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely haven't been seen by the referee. 'Maybe a punch behind the referee's back and fly kick when the ball is away. 'But we think, if the rule has been extended, then it is now erring into re-refereeing a game on a Monday. 'That's not the purpose of video evidence. That's why the English FA and FIFA and UEFA steer away from that. The referee could see the incident on Sunday, he just didn't see the handball.'",

        "article": "Drunks who repeatedly turn up at A&E should be fined to pay for treating for their injuries, Nigel Farage has claimed. The Ukip leader, who admits to having a pint most lunchtimes, said that it was a \u2018reasonable proposition\u2019 to charge people who end up in hospital more than once after drinking. He also revealed he is finding the election campaign \u2018knackering\u2019, as polls suggest support for Ukip is on the slide. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who admits to having a pint most lunchtimes, said that it was a \u2018reasonable proposition\u2019 to charge people who end up in hospital more than once after drinking . Ukip supporters should consider switching to back the Tories in areas where their party cannot win, Nigel Farage has suggested. The Ukip leader said his backers had to use their vote 'as wisely as they can', and urged them to do what they can to secure a referendum on the European Union. David Cameron has urged Ukip supporters to 'come home' to the Tories, the only party able to deliver an EU vote. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, conceded his Ukip supporters could back Conservative candidates in areas where there is no chance of winning. He said: 'Of course, it's a complex electoral system and people have to use their votes as wisely as they can.\" Mr Farage suggested that Ukip MPs could prop up a Tory government to keep Ed Miliband out of power. 'If the Tories were the biggest party, and we helped to make up the numbers and this country had a full, free and fair referendum, that would be an infinitely better position.' There were nearly 60,000 assaults on NHS staff in 2011-12 and alcohol-related hospital admissions have now topped a million a year \u2013 a rise of 510,000 in a decade. Politicians from across the political spectrum have backed the idea of fining or charging people who visit A&E after drinking too much, but doctors leaders warn the plan is unworkable. It would also cast doubt on the principle that the NHS is free at the point of use. Mr Farage said he would support the idea of charging for treating drunks, but only persistent troublemakers. He told the Sunday People: \u2018It wouldn't be for first-time offenders,\" he told the Sunday People in an exclusive interview. \"We were all young once. But for a second offence it's a reasonable proposition.\" But he rejected the idea of issuing fines for people who miss GP appointments. \u2018That would not be practical. Chasing up fines would cost too much money. The NHS has huge problems but I'm totally for an NHS free at the point of delivery.\u2019 Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb last year suggested a \u00a350 levy on drunks. He warned that people who \u2018gratuitously\u2019 consume too much alcohol, especially at the weekends, were putting a \u2018huge\u2019 burden on hospitals. Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt signalled that he was open to the idea of fining those who cost taxpayers through their own \u2018irresponsibility\u2019. \u2018I have a great deal of sympathy for the people who say we should charge people who use A&E because they go over the top on a Friday or a Saturday night,\u2019 he said. \u2018I don\u2019t see why we, as taxpayers, should be funding that.\u2019 Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and\u00a0Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have both signalled they are open to fining drunks who cause problems in A&E . Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine, said in September that the proposal would be \u2018very tricky\u2019. He added: \u2018For example they had a couple of glasses of wine, fell and really hurt themselves? The priority is treating them. \u2018It\u2019s all very well saying these people are a huge burden on hospitals which they are, and A&E staff do face challenging situations. 'But there are many other ways we need to tackle alcohol abuse before it gets to hospital.\u2019 In a separate interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Farage admitted that he tries to drink every day. He also admitted he was feeling the strain of the election campaign, which has been dogged by botched events and falling poll ratings . Asked if he has a pint of bitter every lunchtime, he replied: \"Generally - I try to. I like Adnam's. Young's. Master Brew.\" He also admitted he was feeling the strain of the election campaign. 'Of course it's a bit knackering, I am not superhuman,' he said. Ukip has struggled in recent days with misfiring campaign launches, angry protests and falling poll ratings. The latest ComRes survey for the Mail put the party on 12 per cent, level with the Lib Dems for the first time in two years. It marks a sharp fall from the 19 per cent recorded in October, when Mr Farage boasted he was making inroads across the country.",

Now the iconic van is about to get greener because the bus is being reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed. No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the vehicle's floor and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels. The iconic Volkswagen Westfalia Camper (pictured here including an extendable roof) is about to get greener, because the bus will be reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed . The Volkswagen Westfalia Camper ceased production in 2003, and while VW has rolled out two concept 'microbuses' in recent years, neither have the charm or iconic good looks of its original. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn\u2019t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share some features with the Westfalia Camper, because the placement of the motor and batteries will allow designers to borrow aspects of the original 1950s design. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn\u2019t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share at least three key features with the Westfalia Camper. Volkswagen has unveiled two prototype 'microbuses' including the Bulli (pictured) in recent years . No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the floor in the vehicle and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels, making the new Camper van more environmentally friendly than its predecessor (an example is pictured) No images or name has been announced for the Westfalia Camper version 2.0. It's expected to be an electric vehicle with batteries stashed beneath the floor. A small electric motor will drive its front wheels. Compact technology will enable designers to keep 1950s features. A concept is expected to be revealed in two to five years\u2019 time. 'It\u2019s easy to bring battery space into such a vehicle, because you can put them under the floor. We have these systems already,' he told AutoExpress. By eliminating the need for a conventional petrol engine, VW's designers could position the cabin further forward, to mimic the layout of the original. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it\u2019s financially viable. It's expected that the concept will be revealed in two to five years time. The German automaker resurrected its beloved Beetle in 1997, after various iterations of the model were made for over six decades, between 1938 and 2003, suggesting it may repeat this success story with the VW Camper. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it\u2019s financially viable. VW also unveiled four prototype Beetles at the US auto show, including the\u00a0orange Beetle Wave (pictured) which\u00a0features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard . It unveiled four new concepts for its Beetle car, including two coup\u00e9s and two cabriolets. One of them is the Beetle Cabriolet Denim, which comes in \u2018stonewashed blue metallic\u2019 with a denim-like texture on the soft roof, while the orange Beetle Wave features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard, which the company says \u2018reflects the American spirit on the East and West coast beaches of the USA\u2019.

        "article": "More than a dozen areas in the US have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling, according to a government report released today. The man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. Earthquakes, they said, were sometimes caused by fracking, in which large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations to free oil or gas. Scroll down for video . The study identified 17 areas in the central and eastern US with increased rates of induced seismicity. Since 2000, several of these areas have experienced high levels of seismicity. Researchers say there have been 'substantial increases since 2009 that continue today' They said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground, which can activate dormant faults. Many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the injection of wastewater into disposal wells, but the Geological Survey's report takes the first comprehensive look at where the man-made quakes are occurring. 'The hazard is high in these areas,' said Mark Petersen, who leads the agency's national mapping project. Oklahoma lately has been rocked by more magnitude-3 quakes than California, the most seismically active of the Lower 48 states, Petersen said. Oklahoma was not on scientists' radar until recently when the state experienced a spate of quakes, the largest registering a magnitude-5.6 in 2011. A 2014 United States National Seismic Hazard Maps with the areas most at risk shown in warmer colours. Recently,\u00a0man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states, including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas . The cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 or larger in the central and eastern US, 1973-2014. The rate of earthquakes began to increase starting around 2009 and accelerated in 2013-2014 . Earlier this week, the Oklahoma Geological Survey acknowledged that it is very likely most of the recent shaking is from wastewater disposal. Many faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years, Geological Survey geophysicist William Ellsworth said. 'They're ancient faults,' Ellsworth said. 'We don't always know where they are.' A message to the American Petroleum Institute was not immediately returned. The industry group has said efforts are made to map fault lines where drilling occurs. The fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the 'pore pressure.' The pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together. If the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake. If, however, pore pressures increase, then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake. This type of failure is called shear failure. Injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to 'fail' more easily. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the Earth. Source: US Department of Energy . Increases in the number of tremors from 1960-2010 shown in various regions of the US. \u00a0Scientists said it's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking . A group of experts met last year in Oklahoma to pinpoint seismic hotspots around the country caused by induced quakes. Scientists initially identified 14 regions affected by quakes linked to drilling. They later added three other high-risk areas - northern Oklahoma-southern Kansas; Greeley, Colorado; and Azle, Texas. The findings were released at a Seismological Society of America meeting in Pasadena, California. Seismic hazard maps produced by the Geological Survey and used for building codes and insurance purposes don't include quakes caused by the oil and gas industry. Scientists said it's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking. Researchers study man-made quakes in the affected areas to determine how often they are expected to occur in the next year and how much shaking they would produce. A series of earthquakes that rattled a small Texan community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations.

Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned by Elvis Kwiatkowski and Chas Quye, both 36, before being cut into ten pieces and disposed of in a fishing lake in Dagenham, Essex. The men were obsessed with the extreme pranks from the hit TV show and videos found on their mobile phones showed Mr Buchel being made to rub\u00a0scotch bonnet chilli pepper on his genitals. Killed: Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned to death on March 13, last year, by two 'friends' Blackfriars Crown Court was told the South African was subjected to 'degrading and humiliating violence' that had become 'casual' in the months before his death on March 13, last year. Mr Buchel emigrated to Britain in 2001 with his wife and daughter where they wanted to start a new life\u00a0after hearing stories from his grandfather, a Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain. But he was thrown out of the family home in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction and moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, and other friends. Instead of providing a haven for him, the group were puerile hard-drinkers who entertained themselves with extreme pranks, which Mr Buchel was made to endure. Other videos discovered showed Quye setting fire to his own pubic hair while eating a chilli and taking shots from a BB gun. On the night of his murder Mr Buchel had been drinking in the park before returning to Quye's flat with Kwiatkowski, who he had just met, Hunt and a fellow drinker, Alan Quinn.

The court heard they were obsessed with the hit U.S. television show Jackass . Mr Buchel moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, (left) who was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Bradley Andison (right), 47, who transported the body in a 4x4 was jailed for four years . One witness described seeing Kwiatowski and Quye, brandishing a mallet, standing over Mr Buchel whose head was draped in a sheet. A post mortem found he suffered over 30 blunt force traumas that caused 35 fractures to bones around his body. The following morning the pair set about dismembering the body before enlisting the help of the apartment owner, Hunt, to help them shift the body parts. The court heard how with no means to transport of the corpse the men considered using public transport to. Ian Morley QC, defending, Quye said: 'They were contemplating at one point of using a bus to move the body. That suggests the desperation to which their minds had gone to.' Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of the murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for 3 years . They resorted to using a 4x4 owned by Bradley Andison, 47, from Kent, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before the trial began. The whereabouts of Mr Buchel's corpse remained unknown for weeks after his death, until a young angler mistook his thigh for a dead fish in White Hart Lakes, Dagenham. Judge, Mr Justice Spencer, said: 'Had the body parts all sunk to the bottom of the lake and remained there it may never have been know what you did. 'This was as bad a case of its kind as it is possible to imagine.' Jailing the pair today, the judge added: 'This was a brutal and callous murder, Neill Buchel was 39 years old when he died. 'He was a harmless and inoffensive man, he and his wife had come to this country from South Africa in 2001 with their daughter, their second daughter born here, they wanted to make a better life for themselves. 'His wife and his children never for a moment stopped loving and caring for him. 'The family's loss has been insufferable, the girls have been deprived their father and any chance that they might one day have got back together.' Prosecutor, Sally O'Neill QC, read a victim impact statement by his wife Sharon to the hearing. She said: 'Neill Buchel had a particular fondness for England as his grandfather had been a Spitfire pilot in the war and Neill had enjoyed the stories he used to tell. 'She described him as a loving, caring, funny person who was completely harmless and gentle.' She said despite his trouble with booze he was \"amiable\", he had never been a violent person and a was a peace-loving gentleman who loved his daughters. 'It was her dream as she put it that they would be able to get back together again if he got better.' The court also heard a statement from Patricia Kell, Mr Buchel's mother, which said: 'Not only did they kill my son but they ruthlessly took away someone who we loved and cherished. Mr Buchel (left) emigrated to the UK with his wife Sharon (right) in 2001 but he moved in with friends in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction . 'The awfulness of knowing that they ruthlessly chopped his body into pieces, this child who I have loved, watched grow from a baby into a man, whole in body and soul, the absolute horror of this is indescribable. 'What they saw, and watched and handled, what they desecrated so callously was a loving human being worthy of respect even after death.' Who struck the killer blow was unknown, but Justice Spence said the was was a 'classic joint enterprise' and both were handed the same life sentence. He added: 'Both of you must have realised straight away that Neill Buchel was badly injured and needed urgent medical treatment, but neither of you did anything to help him.' Quye's involvement was made 'even worse' as he had told Mr Buchel's 16-year-old daughter, who cannot be named, the night before that he would care for her inebriated father, the judge said. Quye, who appeared in the dock with a string of rosary beads, and Kwiatkowski showed no reaction as they were ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years and will serve the rest of their lives on licence. The judge said: 'This was an attack of great brutality and ferocity against a man who was quite unable to defend himself. Although both of you were under the influence of drugs you showed him no mercy.' Hunt, who was represented in court by the Prime Minister's barrister brother, Alex Cameron, QC, was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but cleared of murder. A fifth man, Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of Mr Buchel's murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for three years. Andison\u00a0was jailed for four years and a sixth man, Colin Bushaway, 61, was cleared of the charge and an alternative of preventing a lawful burial.",

        "article": "Friends and neighbours. For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood\u2019s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League . But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday . QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). \u2018Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,\u2019 said Ramsey. \u2018He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. 'If I was a betting man, which we\u2019re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.\u2019 Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa\u2019s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers\u2019 stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we\u2019re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up . QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. \u2018Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll speak before the game,\u2019 added Ramsey. \u2018We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,\u2019 said Ramsey. \u2018It\u2019s great you can have two coaches who\u2019ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. \u2018If things hadn\u2019t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.\u2019 Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other . The perspective for Ramsey\u2019s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday . Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead . Austin\u2019s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. \u2018It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,\u2019 said the QPR midfielder. \u2018Certain people who haven\u2019t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.\u2019 QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns .",

        "article": "Mindy Kaling has denied knowing anything about her brother's controversial choice to reveal he pretended to be an African American to get into medical school. A representative for the comedienne told US Weekly she has been estranged from Vijay Chokal-Ingam 'for years' and claimed she 'was not aware of his decision to apply to medical school under a different name and race.' This comes as Chokal-Ingam, 38, admitted his sister has told him she is 'ashamed' of him for opening up about his alleged experience ahead of the release of his new book, Almost Black, in which he will describe how he gained admission to medical school in 1998 by transforming his appearance. Denial: Mindy Kaling has said she was not aware her brother pretended to be black when he applied to medical school in the late 1990s . 'My sister Mindy Kaling (Vera Mindy Chokalingam), of the Mindy Project and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, strongly disapproves of my book,' he wrote. 'She actually said, 'This book will bring shame on our family'. The rest of my family does not agree with the book. Still, they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career,' he added. Chokal-Ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say\u2026 less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. Controversial claims: On his website, AlmostBlack.com, Chokal-Ingam shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of himself as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right). He doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Indian-American man as he did as a black man . His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person. When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. Success: Mindy Kaling (pictured left in August 2014 in LA and right in April 2014 in New York) is the star of her own sitcom The Mindy Project . 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' And unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', Chokal-Ingam didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who 'gets it', while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.'",

And the former Manchester United boss has tipped Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar to be the next man to challenge for the title of world's best player, competing with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. But Ferguson says the 23-year-old, who has been a star since joining Barca from Santos in his homeland two years ago, is still some way off. Sir Alex Ferguson has picked Neymar as the player to reach the level of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . Neymar is the Brazil captain and has been in superb form for both club and country this season . Since joining Barcelona Neymar has been behind Messi in the pecking order, but he could emerge soon . 'You'll always look at clubs like Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United to produce that kind of player you're talking about,' he told radio station SiriusXM FC when asked who can rival Messi and Ronaldo. 'But to be honest I'm not sure there's one sticking out at the moment. The boy Neymar gets a lot of publicity about the potential he's got, but I think that's still to be seen, still to be fulfilled. 'Certainly, most people I speak to speak highly of the boy. When I had Anderson at United, he spoke volumes about the boy's ability. 'So hopefully he'll be the next one who'll produce the type of talent we see in Messi and Ronaldo.' Ferguson insisted that there is no standout player capable of rivaling Messi or Ronaldo at the moment . The two stars are undisputedly the top two players in world football, sharing the last seven Ballon d'Ors . The Premier League's most successful ever manager also backed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, and revealed that the Italian reached out to Ferguson's son, Darren, when he was sacked by Peterborough in February. 'Carlo is a top man,' said Ferguson. 'I was over at the Real Madrid game with Schalke and he was fantastic. 'He came up and he knew Darren had lost his job at Peterborough and said \"Why doesn't Darren come and spend a few days at Real Madrid training? It will do him the world of good\". 'He was fantastic. I can't say enough about that man. He is top drawer - a fantastic human being and a great coach.

Spurs' chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League look over following poor results against Burnley and Aston Villa. But the White Hart Lane club could yet secure another season in the Europa League. Mauricio Pochettino believes Europa League participation could hamper Tottenham's top four hopes . However, Pochettino fears another year in the competition could have a detrimental impact on their hopes of entering Europe's elite club competition. 'I think I confirmed my idea and my thoughts before when I had the same question when I was manager of Southampton. 'The Europa League is difficult. When you are a team like us, you play in the Europa League and the Premier League it is difficult to manage it. The Europa League is good if you arrive at the final.

A veteran of the Iraq war stole thousands of pounds from a children's football club and spent the money on a stag trip to Las Vegas. Lance Corporal Riki Hughes has been jailed for 16 months after he plundered the accounts of Tidworth Town Football Club, where he volunteered as club secretary. He claimed to be making rent payments to the club's landlord - even though the team was actually getting its property for free. Hughes, 31, spent the money on himself, including camping equipment and a stag holiday to Las Vegas, Salisbury Crown Court heard. The former soldier, who served two tours in Iraq, pleaded guilty to stealing \u00a317,000, but the club claimed that the total theft amounted to \u00a326,000. He made out 70 bogus rent payments to an account he'd set up in the name of landlord Aspire Defence, which was not charging the club rent. Judge Andrew Barnett said: 'For two years you milked the funds of that football club, set up principally for those involved in the services and their children. 'You in effect treated a great deal of club money as your own. It was spent on personal luxuries. That's a disgraceful thing to do.' Hughes, from Andover in Hampshire, has been working as a telecoms engineer since he left the Army. Holiday: Hughes spent the money on a stag holiday in Las Vegas, pictured, and camping equipment . The court heard that he had an exemplary career in the military, and no prior criminal record. Relatives burst into tears when Hughes was sentenced to 16 months in prison. Speaking after the case, Tidworth Town chairman said the Wiltshire club was happy that justice had been done. 'It's a relief we can put this to bed now,' he said.",

        "article": "The heartbroken mother of Becky Watts has spoken of her fear of coming face-to-face with Anje Galsworthy - whose son is accused of the teenager's murder. Tania Watts is likely to see her at Becky's funeral, as Ms Galsworthy was also stepmother to the 16-year-old. Speaking to ITV today, Ms Watts spoke of the 'hell' she has endured since the murder, adding: 'I'm still in the back of my mind not accepting...that I'm not going to see her.' Murdered: The body parts of Becky Watts, 16, were found at house in Bristol\u00a0on March 2 and police charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder . Dreading meeting: Becky's heartbroken mother Tani Watts said she fears coming face-to-face with Anjie Galsworthy, (pictured with Becky's father Darren) whose son is accused of the teenager's murder . Becky, 16, vanished from her father's family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19, sparking a huge search operation. Police discovered her body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2 and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. In an ITV interview, Ms Watts described her daughter\u00a0as a 'caring, normal, happy, lovely girl'. She said: 'She made you feel alive. Everyone loved her.\u00a0Knowing it's happened, it's like you are talking about someone else's kid. 'You shouldn't have to bury a child. There are a lot of people on this Earth who don't deserve to be here but Becky was not one of them. 'She should be here.' Accused: Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews is set to go on trial for the 16-year-old's murder . Mr Matthews is pictured in fancy dress alongside his\u00a0girlfriend Shauna Hoare, who\u00a0is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police . Becky grew up with her parents - mother Ms Watts and father Darren Galsworthy - living in separate homes but often tried to bring them together. Ms Watts added: 'That was her aim to make sure we all got on and this is why it was so upsetting because she succeeded in that. 'The one person who was so loyal, so caring and loved us all equally has now gone.' Ms Watts said her daughter was a regular guest at her home, visiting twice a week or so depending on her busy social life. 'She had some hard times in the past, she was very insecure, unconfident, but she got her confidence back and she got a bit of fight in her,' she said. Ms Watts cannot comprehend how, Nathan Matthews, the man accused of her daughter's murder comes from within the 16 year old's home - and she is understandably nervous about seeing his mother, Ms\u00a0Galsworthy. Becky's family home - where she lived with Mr and Mrs Galsworthy - has been the subject of forensic searches since she was reported missing on February 20. Police launched a huge search operation, which included a social media campaign, using the hashtag 'FindBecky'. Anjie and Darren Galsworthy are pictured speaking in a video appeal one week after the 16-year-old's disappearance . A house in\u00a0Barton Court, Bristol, is cordoned off on March 3 after police discovered the body parts of murdered Becky . Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at the family home, as well as at Barton Court where her body parts were found. Two online fundraising pages have also raised more than \u00a311,000, which will pay for Becky's funeral and a foundation in her memory. Mr Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts. A plea hearing has been set for August 4, with a provisional trial date of October 5. All six defendants have been remanded in custody.

        "article": "(CNN)Police added attempted murder to the list of charges against the mother of a quadriplegic man who was left in the woods for days, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien said Tuesday. Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified \"treatment,\" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",

        "article": "She might be celebrating her 75th birthday, but an overjoyed Queen Margrethe of Denmark looked far younger as she waved to excited crowds from the balcony at the Amalienborg Palace. The Danish monarch was joined on the balcony by her sons, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Prince Joachim, 45, who were with her again for a procession down Copenhagen shopping street\u00a0Str\u00f8get to the\u00a0K\u00f8benhavns R\u00e5dhus [city hall] for a slap-up lunch. And the two were by Margrethe's side once again in the evening when the Danish royals welcomed royals from all corners of Europe to Fredensborg Castle for a gala banquet followed by a magnificent fireworks display. Early arrivals: Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark were among the first guests to arrive for the gala dinner . Cut-out: Crown Princess Mary's bell-sleeved dress featured a rather risque cutaway bar, showing off her  ponytail . Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie and Prince Joachim were next to arrive with Prince Joachim wearing a striking red velvet tuxedo . Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie chose a floor-length ivory dress covered in delicate beads . Joining them was Frederik's Australian-born wife Mary, 43, who opted for a striking silver gown featuring a neat high neckline and dramatic blouson sleeves. Margrethe's other daughter-in-law, the French-born Princess Marie, 39, was also at Fredensborg and looked wonderful in a floor-length cream beaded gown. Other members of the Danish Royal Family to attend the event included Margrethe's sister Princess Benedikte, 70, who chose a summery floral dress with a square neck and sheer train. As with Wednesday night's lavish dinner at Christiansborg Palace, Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt \u00a0was on the guest list and cut a dramatic figure in a heavily sequinned black and nude dress. But while socialist politician Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour MP Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, caught the eye, it was the many royals in attendance who took centre stage. Looking good: Queen Margrethe (right) and Princess Benedikte chose complementary gowns in striking lilac and pink . Gorgeous: Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt cut a glamorous figure in her sequinned black gown .

The Norwegian Royal Family was represented by dashing Crown Prince Haakon, 41, who had arrived in the Danish capital earlier that day to mark Queen Margrethe's birthday alongside his wife, the ice blonde Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Margrethe's birthday celebrations had kicked off with a touching family wake-up call, which saw Margrethe's two sons and their families join crowned heads from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to sing traditional Danish folk songs beneath her window. Next on her agenda was an appearance on the balcony of the Amalienborg Palace alongside her son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, his wife Crown Princess Mary, 43, and their four children. Waiting below was an enormous flag-waving crowd who went into raptures as the royals appeared, watched by members of other European royal dynasties, among them Sweden's and Norway's. Also on the balcony was Margrethe's second son, Joachim, 45, his French wife Princess Marie, his children from his first marriage, Nikolai, 15, and Felix, 12, and his youngest two, Henrik, five, Athena, three. One royal who couldn't be present on the balcony or for the gala dinner at Fredensborg that followed was Margrethe's 80-year-old husband Prince Henrik who, according to palace officials, is suffering from flu. The French-born royal also missed the carriage procession down Copenhagen shopping street Str\u00f8get to the R\u00e5dhus and was replaced for the day by his son Frederik.

Held back by his father, the youngster smiled mischievously and was quickly copied by his twin sister Josephine - much to their mother Princess Mary's amusement. Australian-born Mary, who was elegant in a navy ensemble topped with a grey cocktail hat, certainly appeared to be enjoying the moment, smiling broadly as she stood with her four children. Frederik, meanwhile, was content to wave to the crowd and at one point leaned down to whisper in the ear of his older son, nine-year-old Prince Christian. Girls together: Prince Joachim holds his three-year-old daughter Athena, while Crown Princess Mary clutches four-year-old Josephine .

Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, the youngest reigning royals in Europe, led the way in, followed by the equally glamorous King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands. Norway's King Harald, who joined the Danish royals on the balcony, was accompanied by his wife Queen Sonia, and his son Crown Prince Haakon and daughter-in-law Mette Marit. Sweden's 65-year-old King Carl XIV Gustaf also brought his heir, in his case Crown Princess Victoria, 38, and her former personal trainer husband, Prince Daniel.

        "article": "'Discrimination': Gerry Pickens, 28, is suing Orting, Washington, for firing him. He decided to file a suit after vandals sprayed racist graffiti on his car . The first black man ever to be hired as a police officer in a small northwestern town had his SUV sprayed with the N-word over a planned racial discrimination case against town authorities. Gerry Pickens, 28, was fired by the chief of police in Orting, Washington, after just under a year on the town's police force - an act he claims is motivated by racism. Pickens was more used to drugs busts and violent robberies at his previous posting in Atlanta, Georgia - but took a pay cut and moved to quiet Orting, which has just 11 police officers. However, before his probation year was out, Pickens said he had become the butt of racist jokes from residents and his fellow cops - and was eventually fired for reasons he says are down to the color of his skin. The situation came to a head earlier this year, when he woke to find his car daubed with racist graffiti, seemingly prompted by fears he would sue over his dismissal. The vehicle, a Ford Explorer, was filmed by local news station KIRO in the wake of the racist act. On one side, 'n****r' had been sprayed in huge letters. The other side read: 'Sue cheif [sic] and pay'. He later told the King5\u00a0TV station: 'I'm in fear for my life because I don't know who in Orting is out to get me'. The incident, at the end of January this year, came to light again after the Washington Post\u00a0published a long account of Pickens' time in Orting, detailing some of what he sees as racist treatment. 'Sue cheif and pay': Vandals sprayed a misspelled message on the right hand side of Pickens' car dissuading him from legal action. The other side reads 'n****r' He told reporter Eli Saslow that shortly after he started a member of the public played a practical joke on him by calling 911 to report a 'black juvenile' driving a police car after they saw Pickens on patrol. Officers turned it into a joke, continuing to refer to him as the 'black juvenile'. He was also reportedly called a 'token black guy' by colleagues, and feels his vacation requests were handled differently. He also said he was treated unfairly over a complaint that he used a local gym without paying. The allegation - which, according to the News Tribune, was later dropped, saw him suspended from duty. Around the same time, Pickens said, a white officer was subject to an excessive force complaint, but was allowed to keep policing the whole time. Small town: Orting, a Washington town with a population of 8,000, had never had a black cop before Pickens . 'Token black guy': Pickens says that fellow officers picked on him and that he was given harsher treatment than other officers by his superiors . A letter sent to Orting police by Pickens's attorney also said that after he left the force, the chief of police, Bill Drake, 'slandered' his former employee when asked for references by other forces. It claims he 'prevented him from future employment as a police officer.' Drake said he couldn't comment on that allegation due to the impeding legal case. However, the initial letter confirming that Pickens would be fired cited 'unsatisfactory performance'. Other reasons suggested include filing incomplete reports, taking too long responding to an important traffic stop, going home while on duty and not helping an officer in a 'physical altercation'. Allegations: Included in a $5million lawsuit is an allegation that Orting police chief Bill Drake 'slandered' Pickens and stopped him from getting new jobs . According to the Post, Pickens has now filed a suit demanding $5million from Orting - a figure which is more than double the town's annual budget and would equal a payout of around $625 from every single resident. The vandalism of Pickens' car, which is being investigated by a different force to avoid conflicts of interest with Orting Police, remains unsolved. DailyMail.com has contacted Pickens and Orting Police for comment.",

        "article": "British officers were forced to accept the four-day inspection from the experts from Moscow despite heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin . Russian military inspectors have arrived at a huge Nato war games exercise off the coast of Scotland, it emerged yesterday. British officers were forced to accept the four-day inspection from the experts from Moscow under a European arms control treaty despite heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin. They are attending Exercise Joint Warrior, designed to send a signal to the President in the face of continuing aggression. Britain and 11 other Nato countries are set to contribute to the naval exercise, which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how \u2018powerful\u2019 Nato was. But last night it emerged that despite tensions with Mr Putin, Britain was still obliged to allow military inspectors into the country. The visit began on Monday at Lossiemouth and involves experts from the Russian National Nuclear Threat Reduction Centre, international officials said. Russian state media said the team from the centre, part of the counry\u2019s defence ministry, would conduct \u2018a series of checks\u2019 at the exercise. Britain has not inspected Russian since 2010, however Russia is still obliged to accept inspections twice a year from other countries. Under the terms of the Vienna Document 2011 agreement, nations are permitted to conduct a limited number of inspections on the territories of other signatory states. The UK regularly conducts similar inspections on other nations\u2019 territories. Sergey Ryzhkov, head of the centre, said: \u2018During the event, the inspectors will visit ranges and plan to hold command briefings on the conducted military activities.\u2019 It is the first time Russian inspectors have attended Nato manoeuvres since relations between Moscow and the alliance plummeted after the annexation of Crimea. Nato has withdrawn all cooperation from Russia in protest at its aggression in Ukraine and stepped up exercises to try to reassure eastern allies who feel threatened by the Kremlin. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how \u2018powerful\u2019 Nato was . David Cameron reiterated Mr Fallon\u2019s comments last month that the exercise would \u2018send a clear message to those who threaten us\u2019 that the UK and alliance could protect themselves. Members are still bound by several arms control and cooperation treaties though. The Russian team will be escorted at all times and will only be given unclassified information, the MoD in London said. Defence sources said it was \u2018routine\u2019 and Russian officers had last made similar official visits last year. An MOD spokesman said: \u2018This routine inspection, which forms part of our obligations under the Vienna Document 2011, will have no impact on Joint Warrior. The inspection party will not have access to any sensitive information and will be accompanied throughout.'",

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of \u2018We\u2019re rich but our team is s***\u2019 and \u2018Where\u2019s the money gone?\u2019 in protest at Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and later revealed they have \u00a334m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. \u2018I can understand why fans are frustrated,\u2019 said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. \u2018It\u2019s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there\u2019s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they\u2019ve been. They think \u201cWhere else can I make money? Oh a football club\u201d. \u2018I\u2019ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it\u2019s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books - he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club\u2019s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . \u2018I think you\u2019ve got to get the balance right. It\u2019s not just about making money,\u2019 he said. \u2018Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn\u2019t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn\u2019t work. \u2018Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. \u2018To reconnect has to be the best way forward.\u2019 Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .",

        "article": "Hibernian claimed their first Edinburgh derby victory of the season as goals from Jason Cummings and Farid El Alagui sealed a 2-0 win over Hearts and allowed them to collect a valuable three points in the push for second place in the Championship. The Leith outfit were rewarded for a dominant first-half performance against the champions when Cummings - a former youth player at Tynecastle - found the net from close range after 30 minutes. Hearts improved after the break but Hibs sealed the win in the first minute of injury time with a cool finish from El Alagui. Hibernian goalscorer Farid El Alagui celebrates with Liam Craig following Sunday's 2-0 win over Hearts . Jason Cummings (left), who also found the back of the net, celebrates his goal with team-mate Martin Boyle . With the title wrapped up, Hearts went into this match with only derby bragging rights at stake. On paper, the game meant more to promotion-chasing Hibs and Alan Stubbs' side fully deserved all the spoils. There was no guard of honour by Hibs for their city rivals but the travelling fans were in full voice as the teams emerged from the tunnel, blasting out 'championees'. Edinburgh derbies are never short of passion and there was a coming together of Adam Eckersley and Scott Allan inside the first two minutes. No action was taken by referee Kevin Clancy even though Hearts defender Eckersley appeared to move his head towards Allan's. Hibs settled the better of the two teams and created a handful of chances. On 12 minutes, Fraser Fyvie lifted a first-time curling effort over the crossbar from 18 yards before Hearts full-back Callum Paterson headed the ball onto the top of his own bar from a teasing Allan free-kick. Hibs continued to press and Neil Alexander was forced into the first save of the game to push away a curling Cummings effort at the edge of the area after the forward did well to create a yard of space up against Danny Wilson. Hearts goalkeeper Neil Alexander watches on as Cummings shot goes past him and into the back of the net . Hibs finally got a tangible reward for their dominance on the half-hour mark when Cummings put the home side in front. Allan's corner was only partially cleared and El Alagui's flick was slotted into the net by Cummings from three yards. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson did not like what he was seeing and, in reverting to an orthodox 4-4-2, replaced Kevin McHattie with Sam Nicholson. But Hibs created the next chance as the bar again came to Hearts' rescue. Allan's corner caused problems and Liam Fontaine cracked a superb left-footed volley off the woodwork. Hearts made a brighter start to the second period and had a chance to test Hibs goalkeeper Mark Oxley after Jamie Walker was tripped 20 yards from goal. But Alim Ozturk flashed a free-kick wide of the far post. Walker then unleashed a venomous drive from 25 yards that was expertly tipped over by Oxley. Cummings is crongratulated by his team-mates as Hibernian claimed a vital win in the race for second place . Hearts were pressing but Hibs wasted another great chance to add a second in the 67th minute through El Alagui. Allan's corner was lifted back into the area by Fontaine and the unmarked forward swung a tame left-footed volley at Alexander from inside the six-yard box. Hibs survived a goal-mouth scramble in the 74th minute that saw Jordon Forster make a great block to deny Genero Zeefuik. The hosts then went on a three-against-one counter-attack charge led by Dominique Malonga but the Congo international selfishly hit the ball wide when Martin Boyle was in vast amounts of space at the edge of the area. Hearts responded with an opening of their own but Oxley did well to get down to Osman Sow's low effort from 12 yards at his near post. Hibs wrapped up the win in injury time when substitute Franck Dja Djedje found El Alagui in space and the marksman chipped the ball over Alexander from close range.",

        "article": "(CNN)If newly revised NYPD training materials are approved by a federal judge, new cadets could be taking courses reminding them \"not to engage in racial profiling.\" The proposed training materials, overseen by appointed federal monitor Peter Zimroth, were submitted to Manhattan Federal Court judge Analisa Torres on Monday for approval.  They include directives to \"not tell or tolerate ethnic, racial or sexist jokes\" and to \"not imitate the speech patterns\" of others. \"Do not engage in racial profiling,\" the training materials read. \"It is against the law. It violates fundamental democratic precepts and freedoms. It violates this Department's policies. It is offensive. It violates your responsibility to treat people equally. It diverts us from catching real criminals. It alienates us from people who need us, and hurts our ability to do our job. You can probably think of other reasons not to do it, but the point is that you will not do it.\" The training notes also instruct new cadets \"not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them\" and \"not to imitate speech patterns of other racial, ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally\" because \"they appear disingenuous, artificial, and possibly racist.\" The revised training notes, which include 140 pages of instruction and PowerPoint slides, are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the New York Police Department's \"Stop, Question and Frisk\" practice unconstitutional. The NYPD has said the policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- was used to deter crime. The practice had been widely criticized. Police Department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people \"stopped and frisked\" in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic, though New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said 90% of those stopped were innocent. \"The current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... [and] did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in NYPD policies and law,\" Zimroth wrote in a cover letter to Torres.  \"All parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy.\" The NYPD collaborated with Zimroth's team in crafting the final training materials.  They will now \"review their implementation in terms of our current and ongoing practices,\" said an NYPD spokesperson in an email to CNN. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association declined to comment. The materials also provide historical legal information on proper \"stops\" and offers detailed procedures for patrolling buildings for criminal activity.  They also give instructions on how an officer should lawfully conduct him or herself when engaging with the public. \"Remember that a courteous, professional and respectful police officer who illustrates the opposite of bias and discrimination helps create a partnership with the community and builds rapport with the people in it. \"The result is that the citizens become our allies and, in turn, policing becomes safer and easier. This enhances our effectiveness and increases our pride and pleasure in what we do,\" the notes read. If approved, the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets.  They are expected to graduate in June.",

        "article": "A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transsexual convicted murderer with sex change surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. According to the spokeswoman for the federal receiver, who controls California prison medical care, the surgery could cost taxpayers as much as $100,000. U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to 51-year-old Michelle-Lael Norsworthy violates her constitutional rights. Right to be a woman: \u00a0U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to  Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, 51, \u00a0pictured last year, violates her constitutional rights . Her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. Norsworthy has been in prison since 1987, serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. She has twice delayed her scheduled parole hearings in recent months. The ruling says it would be the second time nationwide that such a surgery has been performed on an inmate, an apparent reference to an inmate who castrated himself in Texas then was given the surgery out of necessity. Norsworthy has lived as a woman since the 1990s and has what Tigar termed severe gender dysphoria. 'The weight of the evidence demonstrates that for Norsworthy, the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is SRS,' Tigar wrote, referring to sex reassignment surgery. He found that the decision by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to deny the procedure was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. Corrections officials said they are considering whether to appeal the ruling. Attorneys for Norsworthy did immediately comment. Paid surgery: Michelle-Lael Norsworthy has been living as a woman since the 1990s and her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. 'This would be a first for California, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls California prison medical care. The cost to taxpayers for such surgery is uncertain, she said. 'It's several tens of thousands of dollars, possibly close to $100,000, depending on the circumstances. But It's hard to estimate,' Hayhoe said. Corrections officials, in previous court filings, argued that Norsworthy has received proper medical and mental health care for more than 15 years and is in no immediate medical danger if the surgery is not performed. Her care has included counseling, mental health treatment and hormone therapy that the department said 'has changed her physical appearance and voice to that of a woman' while helping her find her gender identity. That care is consistent with what other judges nationwide have found to be appropriate for transgender inmates, the department said. She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. The sex change surgery will prompt practical problems, the department said. The department also said keeping Norsworthy in a men's prison could invite violence, including possible assault and rape. But she could also face danger at a women's prison \u2014 or pose a threat herself \u2014 because she had a history of domestic violence before her murder conviction, the department said. Possible danger of rape: She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento and there are fears she may be raped when becoming a woman .",

        "article": "For most workers, being told they're getting a raise at work is a cause for celebration, but not for these builders in China. That's because they're constructing a mountain road thousands of feet above the ground in Pingjiang County, Hunan province. With no ropes or safety harnesses, and only hard hats to protect them if they fall, these men spend their days hauling heavy planks and wheelbarrows full of cement over a rickety wooden walkway. On the edge: Workers in China have been pictured building a walkway for tourists while perched thousands of feet up a mountain side in Pingjiang County, Hunan province . Precarious: The men spend their days carrying heavy planks of wood and wheelbarrows full of concrete across a flimsy-looking wooden walkway with so safety harnesses or ropes . Tipping point: Here, the builders are left standing on nothing more than rusty-looking scaffolding poles as they hammer them into the rock to extend the road further round the cliff . Attraction: Pingjiang is dominated by the Mufu mountain range and officials have tried to attract visitors to the small county by construction precarious walkways such as this one for tourists to walk along . In other images the builders can be seen perched on nothing more than rusty metal scaffolding poles as they hammer them into the mountainside to extend the walkway. Chinese officials hope that the road will draw thousands more tourists to the area, as they flock to walk along the scenic route. Pingjiang County is well-known for its mountains, with the Mufu Mountain range sweeping through most of the province, and the national park there already attracts thousands of sightseers. Local authorities have tried to capitalise on this popularity by building a winding series of mountain roads and glass walkways along some of the sheerest cliff faces. Under construction: The workers first assemble the scaffolding poles along the cliff before constructing a walkway of wooden planks along the top, and then use this as a base to construct a more stable concrete path . Don't look down: Without ropes or safety harnesses, and with only hard hats to protect them if they fall, these men assemble scaffolding along the cliff, which is the first stage of extending the walkway . Nerve-wracking: With little or no safety equipment, these are the brave men charged with helping to build this tourist attraction in Pingjiang County, south eastern China, which officials hope will bring tourists to the area . Danger: These men pour heavy concrete into moulds set into the mountain walls, with the whole structure balanced on top of wooden planks and rusty scaffolding poles . It is not known exactly where this walkway is being constructed, but it is very similar in appearance to another mountain path being built along the side of Shifou Mountain, in nearby Jiangxi province. That road has been under construction since at least 2011, and also saw workers balancing on a flimsy 3ft-wide wooden walkway thousands of feet up a mountain. Once completed, that road would have stretched for nearly two miles around the cliff top, making it China's longest mountain sightseeing road. Engineer Yu Ji, 48, who has been building these roads for a decade, said: 'I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s so different from any other job. It\u2019s not as dangerous as people think. You just wear ropes then everything is OK.' Heavy load: Workers are pictured filling in the bridge with concrete, with all the weight balanced on top of rickety wooden planks . Hard labour: The men are expected to spend their days hauling heavy wooden planks and wheelbarrows full of concrete back and forth across the walkway, despite being suspended thousands of feet in the air with no safety equipment . Toughing it out: These workers manage to look like they're enjoying themselves, despite being just one step away from death on this mountainside in south eastern China . Another glass-bottomed walkway opened in Pingjiang in 2014, suspended 600ft above the ground, it is actually a suspension bridge that stretches between two mountaintops. Because it is only held up by steel cables which anchor it to the surrounding rocks, the bridge actually sways when the wind blows, making it especially terrifying for tourists to cross. So many visitors get stuck on the bridge, their legs paralysed by fear, that the tourist board employs specially trained staff who are on hand to help them to the other side.",

        "article": "(CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is \"still the leader\" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's \"Cultural Commission\" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. \"There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive,\" said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. \"I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present,\" Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016 . The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. \"The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment,\" said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia.\" Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. \"He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet,\" said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering \"orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders.\" The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his \"preferred weapon of choice\" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a \"well-known and respected erudite and social figure,\" died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups \"against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets,\" according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots \"launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy\" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years. The movement claims he continues to oversee a Taliban leadership council, judiciary and nine executive commissions, as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.

        "article": "(CNN)As we approach April 27 when South Africa marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994, we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against African migrants. Outrage triggered by this violence is being heard loudly throughout social media with \"#WeAreAfrica\" showcasing the need for a common front against this affront. These recurring attacks against migrants and their property might be read as one more indication of how the rainbow nation's dream has faltered. That vision not only symbolized a multi-ethnic South Africa, but one where living in dignity is shared across racial and class lines. Attacks against newcomers in South Africa are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black Africans. The national and international headlines use \"xenophobia\" as if any one word can convey the multifaceted crisis within which this phenomenon occurs. Labeling this turmoil as xenophobic fails to convey the conditions in which African migrants are scapegoated for the persistent legacy of apartheid in the post-liberation era. This word also does not tell us that extreme poverty now exceeds that experienced under apartheid. And it certainly does not account for how extreme inequality is now fully embraced and normalized by a new black elite joining the \"white-haves\" of yesteryear. The question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam, as if the majority of black citizens and African migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white South Africans or white foreigners. Contact between the majority of African migrant groups and native black South Africans mostly occurs in under-developed informal settlements and townships. In the interaction and competition between these groups in these spaces, we need to be wary of the simplistic treatment of South Africa's ailment as xenophobia. Such labeling does not and cannot explain the totality of the contact, competition and conflict between native poor black South Africans and foreign African entrepreneurs. Attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of South Africa's black majority experiences segregation, persistent and relative poverty, and high crime rates in post-apartheid South Africa is paramount. Neglecting access to social rights, such as water, electricity, education and other services, is tantamount to violence by political leaders against the poor. Condemning and prosecuting those who incite violence is essential to maintaining law and order and protecting those vulnerable because of their nationality. But the evictions, harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners cannot and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor South Africans in informal settlements and many townships experience. It cannot and should not be separated from South Africa's status as one of the most unequal societies in the world; it cannot and should not be separated from the fact that South Africa has one of the highest homicide levels in the world. A mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society (the poor, the disabled, women, children, the elderly) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing African foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty. Labeling South Africa's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other Africans bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity. Such labeling only serves politicians and the elites who are sealed off by barbed wire surrounded by a security industry that outspends and outnumbers South Africa's police force. It allows corruption to persist while the political leaders who are implicated in this violence scapegoat \"criminal youth\" to further fill an overflowing prison industry. Religious and civil society leaders' recent mobilization saying \"not in our name\" in reaction to violence against migrants should be applauded. But religious, civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in South Africa. Pervasive misery and corruption in the midst of a nation with so much potential should not be tolerated. Neither a hashtag of outrage #WeAreAfrica nor the expedience of the label \"xenophobia\" can wish away the angst, violence and the impending crisis in South Africa. Migrants' security and dignity is part and parcel of a greater security and dignity for all South Africans, which seem deferred for now.",

        "article": "Washington (CNN)In a broad bipartisan vote, the Senate on Tuesday gave final approval to a Medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the \"doc fix,\" a method the government has used to ensure payments to Medicare providers will keep up with inflation. The bill, which passed 92 to 8, also includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program. The issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called passage of the bill a \"major, major accomplishment.\" \"Tonight, the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote. The House approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it.  Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary \"doc fix\" had already expired. Some conservative senators, including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, balked at the more than $200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset. The bill, \"institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades,\" Cruz said in a statement.  \"Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare.\" But that amendment was defeated, as were several others from each party that came up for votes. Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill. \"Unless the Senate passes the House-passed 'doc fix,' significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow,\" Boehner said.  \"We urge the Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay.\" Cruz voted against the bill, as did Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican running for president. GOP presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted for the bill.",

Odegaard picked Real Madrid over Liverpool and Manchester United at the start of the year but the record-breaking teenager is already experiencing how difficult it can be for young players in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid Castilla, managed by first-team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane, were top of their regional third division when Odegaard arrived at the club in January, but after he made his debut the team\u2019s form dipped dramatically and following a run of four straight defeats, they dropped to seventh place, four points off the lead. Martin Odegaard, pictured in training with the Real Madrid first team, has been dropped by the Castilla side . Odegaard is said to be on a different wavelength to his Castilla team-mates as he rarely trains with them . Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian as he looks to secure promotion . Martin Odegaard was chased by a host of top European clubs before he left Stromsgodset for Real Madrid. The Norwegian youngster visited Liverpool and Arsenal's training grounds, as well as Bayern Munich. He is thought to be on wages of around 40,000-a-week after Real spent \u00a32.3million to acquire his services. Age: 16 (D.O.B. 17/12/98) Born: Drammen, Norway . Position: Attacking midfielder . Clubs:\u00a0Stromsgodset (2014-15), Real Madrid (2015- . Castilla appearances: 7 . Castilla goals:\u00a01 . International appearances: 3 . International goals: 0 . There have been suggestions that other B-team players resented the fact that Odegaard was training with the first team three times a week and then starting Castilla games very much on a different wavelength to his team-mates. The Norway international might be benefiting from training with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale but it was not helping him become a cohesive part of the Castilla side. And they had the perfect chance to prove they were better off without him when he was called up by Norway coach, Per-Mathias Hogmo, for the recent European Championship Group H qualifier against Croatia. They won the match played in his absence and despite the fact that he was back in Madrid and available at the weekend Zidane kept him out of the team and they won again. Real Madrid are desperate to see their Castilla side promoted and Zidane must now decide if Odegaard\u2019s presence is doing more harm than good. The teenager was involved with Norway on international duty last week and Castilla prospered without him . If Real Madrid Castilla fail to go up to the second division then Odegaard will be loaned out next season . Odegaard signed for Real in a \u00a32.3m deal in January as Carlo Ancelotti placed his trust in the 16-year-old . The Norwegian\u2019s future is also tied to whether or not promotion is achieved. He was never going to be asked to play another year of Spanish third division football so if Castilla fail to go up to the second division he will be loaned out next season. No one at Real Madrid believes the club has made a huge mistake in signing Odegaard but it was a measure of how they will need to be patient with their precocious young talent when first-team coach Carlo Ancelotti decided against playing him in the Champions League against Schalke despite pressure to pick him. Odegaard would have been the youngest player ever to play in the competition. With his path to first-team involvement currently blocked and the B team choosing to chase promotion without him he might even be questioning his decision to turn down a clutch of Premier League clubs in favour of Real Madrid.

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.",

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took action against the supermarket company last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores. ASIC also found that ALDI failed to disclose the 0.5 percent surcharge it charges consumers paying by credit card in some of its stores. Scroll down for video . Discount supermarket Aldi is under fire for failing to notify customers of a 0.5 percent surcharge on credit card fees six months after it promised the corporate regulator it would . Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made. But Fairfax Media\u00a0reports that Aldi has not consistently disclosed the surcharge to customers and many were unaware about the additional fees. Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said Aldi had carried out an audit last year to make sure appropriate signs were visible. 'If for any reason an Aldi store does not have the required signage, we will ensure that this is corrected immediately,' she said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against Aldi last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge on transactions made using tap and go . Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print . Under the ASIC Act, retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges, or create the impression that surcharges do not apply, may be considered 'misleading or deceptive'. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges. 'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said. 'Consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or 'tap and go' cards are currently treated as credit card transactions, meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place, even where they are using a debit card.' In ALDI stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge, irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card. An ALDI spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to 'cover the costs associated with the service'. 'ALDI is aware there are high costs associated with accepting credit cards,' she said. Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made . 'However, rather than inflating prices across the board, to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs, ALDI prefers customers to make the choice themselves.' Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go. 'Most people don't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that,' Mr Godfrey said. 'What we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level, and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on. 'The surcharge at ALDI is not excessive, but I don't think it's great they're charging a surcharge on a debit facility, so people's savings accounts.' Mr Godrey said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go. 'I think it's always important to ask - as you've seen with ALDI, you might assume there isn't a surcharge because Coles and Woolies don't have one,' Mr Godfrey said. 'If you're going to use tap and go you should ask what the surcharge will be, then ask for a surcharge free option.'",

        "article": "This felt a heavy blow for Derby County. Looking on course for a first victory in seven Championship games against the 10 men of Watford, they conceded an equaliser to Odion Ighalo that further undermines their promotion ambitions. Adlene Guedioura seized on hesitant defending by Craig Forsyth with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his Watford team-mate, who poked the ball past Lee Grant to snatch an unlikely point. There was a seismic rally from the hosts, who ended the game camped in Watford\u2019s box, never mind half. The final act was Heurelho Gomes producing a fingertip save from Richard Keogh\u2019s header. Odion Ighalo celebrates after scoring Watford's equaliser to secure them a point at the iPro Stadium . Ighalo is joined by team-mate and captain Troy Deeney (right) after making the score 2-2 on Friday night . Darren Bent celebrates his goal from the penalty spot with Derby's mascot at the iPro Stadium . Derby County: Grant 6.5; Christie 4 (Lingard 46\u2019 6), Keogh 6.5, Shotton 6, Forsyth 5; Thorne 5 (Hendrick 29\u2019 6), Hughes 6.5, Bryson 6 (Martin 76\u2019 5); Ince 7.5, Russell 7, Bent 6.5 .

Gomes had earlier saved with his legs from Darren Bent. There was a goalline clearance. Chris Martin arrived for his first minutes in nearly two months. But it is only a point for Steve McClaren\u2019s side. Enough to lift them back into the play-off places having fallen out earlier on Good Friday following positive results for those around them. Only on goal difference however. Having played a man up for the entire second half, this was a big opportunity missed. It had seemed Tom Ince, fresh from pulling out of England\u2019s Under-21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career, had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for Derby\u2019s season. Ince picked up the ball in the 57th minute, danced round two Watford defenders and bent a finish into the far corner. At that stage Derby were set for a first victory since February 24. But Slavisa Jokanovic adjusted his team cleverly and Watford found a way through. Derby had begun the match as if the international break had been spent on a leash now removed. A fortnight to stew on poor form and a loosening grip on promotion ambition, here was an chance to illustrate there is life in the old dog yet. Tom Ince watches on as his strike flies into the bottom corner to put Derby 2-1 up against Watford . Ince (left), alongside team-mate Bent, celebrates putting Derby in the lead against their promotion rivals . Steve McClaren screams from the touchline as his Derby side look to strengthen their promotion charge . Just two points collected in six games and the for those around them earlier in the day meant Derby entered the contest outside the top six for the first time since September 27. Watford came into this game with a defeat ringing in their ears too, a 1-0 home reverse to Ipswich, but in pretty decent nick in general: five wins from the six before that. The atmosphere carried the appropriate edge for a match of this magnitude, both sets of fans vocal. It was the hosts who started with greater energy. Watford's Marco Motta saw red just before half-time when he brought down Johnny Russell in the  area . Bent slotted the penalty past\u00a0Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal to level the scores at 1-1 . The former England striker's penalty levelled the score at 1-1 just before the half-time break . In the 15th minute Bent had a close-range shot deflected wide and from the resulting corner a smart routine, involving Craig Bryson and George Thorne, saw Tom Ince released to the byline. His cutback found Bent but the striker\u2019s former Tottenham colleague Heurelho Gomes saved the finish superbly. Watford, starting with three forwards in Troy Deeney, Matej Vydra and Ighalo who have 48 Championship goals between them this season, carried a sizeable offensive threat. In the 23rd minute they went ahead. It was more sloppy defending from Derby, who have suffered from slackness at the back during their downturn. Cyrus Christie was twice at fault, first losing possession to Vydra when trying to dribble clear then driving his attempted clearance in the box straight into Ighalo. The ball popped to Vydra who lashed home a first-time finish for his fifth goal in seven games. Matej Vydra celebrates his goal - the first of the match - to put Watford in the lead away from home . Vydra (left) smiles to the crowd after putting Watford 1-0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches . Late in the game, there was a brutal clash of heads between Adlene Guedioura (left) and Ryan Shotton . Both players were sent flying and needed extensive treatment from their respective physios . Guedioura was impressive for Watford, and was named man of the match by Sky shortly after his injury . McClaren came down from his position in the stands unusually early to bark instructions and rearrange his side with George Thorne needing to come off injured on his return from a spell out. Jeff Hendrick was sent on and contributed to the equaliser, delivering a smart backheel that gave Ince space to thread a pass to Johnny Russell in the area. He took a touch and was brought down by Marco Motta. Referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and, after consideration, produced the red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity. This was welcome change for Derby fans who had seen their side suffer defeat Wolves last time out after a horrible officiating error. Bent stepped up and dispatched the penalty with clinical power, his eighth goal since arriving on loan from Aston Villa. McClaren replaced Christie with Jesse Lingard in a bold attacking move at the interval, in search of a crucial victory. But it was not to be. Bent swivels to shoot at Gomes in the Watford goal, but he puts it wide and misses the chance to score . Bent reacts to his missed chance, while Watford's Ben Watson (right) watches on with relief .

        "article": "Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder. The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between\u00a0125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Sources: NHS Choices and Polycystic Kidney Charity .",

        "article": "A filthy pub where 24 customers were struck down with food poisoning was found with mouse droppings on the floor and rotting meat in the kitchen. Environmental health were called to The Sutton Arms, in Elton, Stockton last year after two dozen people suffered\u00a0gastroenteritis after eating at the pub on Easter Sunday. Inspectors discovered evidence of a rodent infestation in the food storage area which was littered with droppings and food past its sell-by date. A box of meat with a broken lid is kept at the pub where 24 customers were struck down with gastroenteritis . The Sutton Arms where two dozen people suffered gastroenteritis and six of them had Clostridium perfringens - a common cause of food poisoning . Owner Michael Alan Flegg, 68, pleaded guilty to\u00a0nine food hygiene offences when he appeared at Teesside Magistrates' Court yesterday. The court heard that Stockton Council's environmental health department\u00a0investigated the pub after receiving a complaint from a member of the\u00a0public saying they had food poisoning. Six specimen samples from\u00a0people who visited the pub on April 20 last year were taken - all from six\u00a0different households. Michelle Stowe, representing Stockton Council, said 24 people suffered\u00a0gastroenteritis and six of them had Clostridium perfringens - a common\u00a0cause of food poisoning. Gastroenteritis is a condition where the stomach and intestines become\u00a0inflamed, and symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and\u00a0cramping. Ms Stowe told the court that the common source between the people sampled\u00a0was the Sutton Arms. Filthy: Evidence of a rodent infestation were found at the pub in Stockton-on-Tees with mouse droppings discovered on the floor . A dirty bucket at The Sutton Arms, in  Elton, which has admitted a string of food hygiene offences . The owner of the pub where inspectors found food past its sell-by-date and rotting meat, Michael Alan Flegg, 68, has admitted nine food hygiene offences . A visit was made and it was found to have unsatisfactory\u00a0food hygiene standards, including food that was past its sell-by date and  food storage containers not kept in good order and condition. There was also evidence of rodent activity in an external food storage\u00a0shed, where officers found mouse droppings. Following the initial complaint, 14 visits by environmental health officers were made to the pub and 13 of those were non-compliant with food hygiene regulations. Ms Stowe said that food including chicken, milk and beef were found out of date. On one occasion, three pieces of braising steak were found sticky, smelling\u00a0and decomposing. Flegg has since sacked the two managers who were working at the time of the breach. After the hearing he said: 'I have taken a back seat for\u00a0some years due to my age and I put trust in my management team. 'I was devastated to find out what had happened. I was on holiday at the\u00a0time when the investigation started. We had two managers in place at the\u00a0time, who were sacked and have now been replaced. We have also replaced the kitchen staff. 'It has been very distressing and upsetting, I have more than 30 years of\u00a0experience in this trade.

'I do understand that as the licence holder it is my responsibility, and we\u00a0have worked hard to turn the place around.' A date for sentencing has not yet been set. Despite the changes in staff, there have still been complaints about the restaurant on TripAdvisor. One reviewer, who visited the restaurant earlier this month, had said: 'A disaster from start to finish! 'Let me tell you if you want to pay top prices for frozen c**p then this is the place for you.' Another poster, called Neil J, complained about the cleanliness of the\u00a0restaurant\u00a0and the 'dirty' food. He said: 'The food arrived hot but poorly presented. Chips in a side bowl and remnants of oil on the plate, very dirty oil at that. 'Once emptied out of the bowl there was probably enough to cook some more, chips were very dark brown and tasted of the fryer they came from. The only taste came from the dirty oil. 'The tables had candle holders on with chips out of then that were quite sharp to the touch and cobwebs on the clutter that is above your head and quite dusty too.'",

Ronaldo, 30, scored the landmark goal against Rayo Vallecano on April 8 and only trails Raul (323) and Alfredo di Stefano (307)  in the scoring charts for the Spanish giants. And after training on Friday Ronaldo posed with the commemorative '300' strip alongside his team-mates in Madrid. Cristiano Ronaldo was presented with a shit with '300 goals' on the back by Real Madrid club president Florentino Perez on Friday . Ronaldo reached the landmark figure in only his 288th game for the club against Rayo Vallecano on April 8 . Ronaldo's Real Madrid team-mates including Gareth Bale embrace the Portuguese forward after he scored his 300th goal for the club . The Portuguese forward has only taken six years to reach the figure in all competitions, having signed for the club for a then world-record fee of \u00a380million from Manchester United.

Corriere dello Sport\u00a0claim that Juve have a plan in place to sign the in-demand Uruguayan as they look to partner him with fellow South American Carlos Tevez. Cavani, who played for Italian sides Palermo and Napoli before joining PSG in a \u00a350million deal in 2013, has admitted his frustration at being played out of position under Laurent Blanc. PSG striker Edinson Cavani (left) is a target for Juventus according to Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport . Manchester United also hold an interest in Cavani, pictured in action against Marseille last weekend . He told Canal Plus: 'The only concern that I have ever spoken about is that I was recruited to play as a striker with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic and it has not always been the case. 'There is a long series of games where I have not scored in Ligue 1 but that can happen. In France, people judge me as a lone striker, but I do not play in that position.' Former Manchester United boss David Moyes attempted to sign Cavani before he joined PSG and the Old Trafford club remain interested in acquiring him when the transfer window reopens. Louis van Gaal is hoping to bring two new strikers to Old Trafford this summer with Radamel Falcao unlikely to turn his loan move into a permanent one and Robin van Persie being eyed by both Juve and Inter Milan. United appear to have an advantage over Juventus in their pursuit of Cavani after the player's agent,\u00a0Claudio Anelucci, admitted that a move to England or Spain was most likely. Cavani (left) has admitted that he is concerned about playing out of position under Laurent Blanc (right) Cavani's agent\u00a0Claudio Anelucci says his client is most likely to move to England or Spain this summer . He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' 'Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani.'",

        "article": "SeaWorld has been accused of drugging killer whales, painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned. A lawsuit filed by\u00a0Joyce Kuhl, a grandmother from South Carolina who visited the Orlando park in 2013, claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools, leaving the marine animals 'essentially roasting'. In her suit, Ms Kuhl\u00a0alleges that the resulting burns are so bad staff are forced to paint the orcas with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries . Scroll down for video . Accusations: A lawsuit claims the orcas at SeaWorld Orlando are being kept in shallow holding pools which give them such bad sunburns staff are forced to paint them to disguise the injuries . Ms Kuhl wants to have her $97 ticket reimbursed, as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, accusing SeaWorld of 'false, misleading and deceptive business practices,' the Orlando Sentinel reports. In her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld, and that the chlorine used in their tanks is 'many times stronger than household bleach'. Kuhl's suit details allegations of forced breeding, incestuous inbreeding and whales kept together in ways that make them hyper-aggressive so that they fight and inflict deep gashes on each other. She claims to have witnessed whales 'banging their heads against their tanks and grinding their teeth on the walls, floors and bars until their teeth break or are worn to the pulp, allegedly because of boredom, frustration and ennui,'\u00a0The Guardian reports. This is the second lawsuit against SeaWorld in less than one month, with similar filed in California which accuse the company of 'misleading the public' by claiming that their killer whales are happy. The lawsuit also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld . This follows a failed social media campaign last month, during which SeaWorld organised a Q&A on Twitter using the hashtag #AskSeaWorld. Instead of the intended questions about opening hours, animals and attractions, the company was asked if their 'tanks were filled with orca tears'. Many people used the opportunity to express their anger at the company and questioned its ethics for keeping killer whales and other animals in captivity, often in solitary confinement. User @AshleeCheese_ tweeted: 'Why do you keep breeding whales when you barely have enough room for one? #AskSeaWorld.' Another campaigner @Jennyleeisme followed suit and tweeted: 'Do you really believe Shamu Stadium is the most advanced marine mammal habitat? Have you seen the ocean? #AskSeaWorld.' Animal rights group PETA was quick to make its views known, tweeting a series of photographs of the marine creatures, reportedly showing signs of their distress. The backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary BlackFish, which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale Tilikum's fatal attack on trainer Dawn Brancheau at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. The 80-minute film, which premiered at Sundance in 2013, prompted questions about the ethics of keeping the large mammals in tanks. Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years. Recent figures show attendance to the company's 11 parks between October and December 2014 fell 2.2 percent to 4.4 million from 4.5 million in the same period a year ago. Attendance fell 4.3 percent during the entire year to 22.4million from 23.4million in 2013. During the fourth quarter last year, the company reported a loss of $25.4million, compared with a loss of $13million in the same period a year before.",

        "article": "The devastated parents of a 31-year-old Australian nurse who died six days after giving birth to her second child have revealed how doctors once told them their daughter wouldn't even live to see her sixth birthday, let alone have her own children. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof was diagnosed with a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, called Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, aged just five, and her parents were informed she only had three months to live. Incredibly Anne-Louise went on to defy all the odds against her, eventually moving to Canada where she worked as a nurse and began raising her own family. However, she tragically died  during a routine hospital check-up for her baby girl Elizabeth Kelly, near her home in Rossland, British Columbia in Canada, six days after giving birth on March 10. A\u00a0fundraising page set up by her friends has raised an incredible $40,000 in her memory. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof (right) died suddenly just six days after giving birth to her baby daughter (centre) \u2018After such immense joy, there is now such sadness and pain over this tragic loss,\u2019 the page says. Anne-Louise, who grew up in Sydney, collapsed in the waiting area of the Canadian hospital and is believed to have died suddenly from a burst cyst in her pancreas. Her husband Ryan Kelly wrote on Facebook after her death: \u2018Instantly all the hospital\u2019s emergency staff were there and did everything in their power and worked longer than ever before but couldn't bring my love, partner, mother to my children, best friend back from the angels.\u2019 In a touching tribute he said: \u2018It's not fair, nothing could be more sad or devastating. But we have been swallowed by love and support and energy of a community spread all over the world, we all will carry on and be strong for Lou and follow her courageous example of living.' Ryan is now tasked with raising their two-year-old son Emerson and newborn Elizabeth as a single parent. Anne-Louise's two children, Emerson (left) and Elizabeth (right), are being for by her husband and their father Ryan . Anne-Louise (right) was with her husband Ryan (left) when she collapsed in the waiting area of a Canadian hospital . He said the children are \u2018both doing great\u2019 and noted \u2018we all are feeling the love you all are sending. It is giving us strength to get through this terrible time. We couldn't do it without you.\u2019 Anne-Louise\u2019s father Ray van den Nieuwenhof told the Sydney Morning Herald how his daughter had courageously battled cancer at the age of five after being given a triple dose of chemotherapy. She developed the cancer again while in Year 11 at school and underwent extensive surgery but went on to become a high achiever, who flourished in sport, politics and her medical career. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof's Facebook photo shows her with her siblings Mary-Ellen, Timothy and Michael . A Gofundme page set up to help the family reads: \u2018Lou was an amazing young woman. She was a fantastic mom to two year old Emerson and little Beth, devoted spouse, best friend and soulmate to Ryan, and loved dearly by all of her family and friends. \u2018She touched the lives of everyone she knew through her contagious smile, support and compassion for others and love for life and adventure. She will be forever missed.\u2019 In a tragic twist, one of Anne-Louise's colleagues at the hospital where she worked was killed on the way home from her funeral on Thursday. Amanda Koppin's car was hit by a tree which fell from a cliff while she was driving with her husband and two-year-old son.",

        "article": "A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which\u00a0aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply . Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption . According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'.\u00a0OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world.\u00a0There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting.\u00a0In the classes, which cost \u00a3195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the \u00a3195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently\u00a02,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain . Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation . A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been \"on the menu\" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. Vanity Fair named Daedone in its list of 'Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex' and around 900,000 people have viewed her  Ted talk, entitled Orgasm, the Cure for Hunger in Western Woman.",

Wednesday's issue of \"All-New X-Men\" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. \"There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,\" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. \"The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told.\" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the \"All-New X-Men\" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women \"hot,\" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the \"X-Men\" films, as well as the 1981 animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.\" The \"X-Men\" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: \"i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...\"",

The agreement with Tebow, 27, stemming from a framework that was put into place when he worked out with the team last month, has been finalized, reports say. Tebow's last\u00a0regular-season NFL game appearance was in December 2012 with the New York Jets, from which he was released\u00a0in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season on the team. Scroll down for video . Tim Tebow will sign as a quarterback with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. He will join the team just in time for the start of the off-season program . Though Tebow hasn't been a part of an NFL organization since 2013, he spent the last two season training with noted throwing coach Tom House, who also worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady . The New England Patriots made Tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no NFL team wanted him. Prior to agreeing to sign Tebow, the Eagles wanted to trade backup quarterback Matt Barkley, but couldn't get enough in return, Schefter said in a Facebook post. The Eagles decided to still bring Tebow on to the roster so he could be present for the team's whole off-season program. It was originally reported after his training session with the Eagles that Tebow would not be joining the team. But now he will join a crowded quarterback roster, which included Sam Bradford, March Sanchez and Barkley. Tim Tebow's last regular-season NFL game was with the New York Jets in 2012 . Not only will this give Philadelphia three former first-round picks at the quarterback position and another decorated college player, but it will also reunited Tebow and Sanchez, who were teammates when they both were on the Jets roster. Tebow's pursuit of being an NFL quarterback is back on, after being on hold since being cut from the Patriots. 'I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback,' Tebow wrote on Twitter after he was released by New England, according to Schefter. Since then, Tebow spent two full seasons training with noted throwing coach Tom House, who also worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. He has also been working for ESPN and as an analyst for the SEC Network. Tebow has an 8-6 record as an NFL starting quarterback with a career 48-per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly has made several off-season moves this year. His remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him. Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades. Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL. His strength has been running the ball or improvising.",

        "article": "Craig Gardner hailed a 'massive' win for West Brom at Crystal Palace on Saturday as the Baggies eased their relegation fears. The midfielder scored a spectacular strike as former Palace boss Tony Pulis enjoyed a 2-0 win on his first return to Selhurst Park. The Welshman left Palace on the eve of the new season and has since taken over at the Hawthorns - with three points in south London crucial having seen his side lose their last three in the Premier League. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side . But Gardner, whose trademark second-half goal added to James Morrison's early header, knows the job is still not yet complete even if West Brom now sit eight points clear of the bottom three. 'Yes, it's massive,' he said when asked about the importance of the victory. 'The gaffer has given us the target of 40 points and we will be disappointed if we don't hit that. 'We had two or three bad results on the spin and it's nice to get a win over the line after those. We were expecting what they brought with us and we dealt really well with it.' Gardner revealed the set-piece which led to Morrison heading home in the second minute came straight from the training ground as he now looks to add to his own tally for the season. 'It was a start that we worked on all week in training and it has worked perfectly,' he added. Gardner lets fly with this long range strike, which ended up doubling West Brom's lead at the Selhurst Park . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner . On the goal he scored, Gardner added: 'It was nice to catch one like that, over the years I've caught a couple of sweet ones and I usually get a couple in a season so I'm waiting for another one now.' For Palace, their fine run of form may have come to an abrupt end but Scott Dann, who was signed by Pulis in January 2014, insists the squad will dust themselves down and look to go again at home to relegation-threatened Hull next weekend. 'We've been on a great run,' he told Palace's official website. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher (right) celebrates with goalscorer James Morrison at Crystal Palace . 'We've come into the game high on confidence and we felt we were going to get the three points today. 'We conceded the early goal which was a big setback for us and we couldn't get back into the game but these things happen in the Premier League. 'We've got to pick ourselves up and move onto the next one, and take the confidence we gained from the last four wins into the last five games.'

        "article": "Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room. The spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it's only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain, the researchers say. Scroll down for video . The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. 'This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the\u00a0Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body. 'Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,' said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL). The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body. The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects. Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. 'We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . 'And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. 'And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. 'So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,' said Blanke. The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up 'sensorimotor' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. The study, published in Current Biology, said that 'simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia'. Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations. 'We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.' Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. 'A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.' Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.",

        "article": "(CNN)Buckle up for another Mercedes battle in the Formula One world championship. Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly. The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai's sunny skies. \"It was great to have a smooth weekend,\" the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium. \"The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit.\" F1 championship standings . Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai. Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton. \"It was an important comeback for the team,\" said the 2014 championship runner-up. Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015. \"We just wanted to bring the podium back home,\" said Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing. \"It's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good. I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys.\" Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg, after the first three races of the year. Rosberg unhappy . It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season. On Saturday, Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio: \"Oh, come on guys!\" Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel, both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier. \"Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up,\" Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall. Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio: \"OK Lewis we'd like to pick the pace up a little bit.\" Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up, pushing him back into Vettel's thrall and taking life out of his tyres. \"It's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front,\" Rosberg said in the post-race media conference. \"That was compromising my race. Driving slowly, that was unnecessary, and meant Sebastian was closer to me. \"It cost me a lot of time ... I'm unhappy about that of course.\" Hamilton responded: \"It's not my job to look after Nico's race. It's my job to bring the car home. \"I didn't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down. If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.\" Bahrain . Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium. If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge, which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi, he will need to turn things around soon. Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day's time. Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again, as they did on Sepang's sizzling circuit. The Italian team have the horsepower. Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth. There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China. The Spanish double world champion missed the Australian Grand Prix because of a head injury sustained in testing and then retired in Malaysia.",

        "article": "(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 5:22 p.m. ET] . None of the girls rescued from raided Boko Haram camps in Nigeria has been identified thus far as among the missing Chibok girls, a high-ranking Nigerian army official said. The official did not rule out that captives from other Boko Haram camps that were raided might be girls abducted in April 2014 from a school in Chibok. The official said he would have the final word by day's end on Wednesday. [Previous story, posted at 4:52 p.m. ET] . Nigerian troops rescued 200 girls and 93 women Tuesday in the Sambisa Forest, the Nigerian Armed Forces announced on its official Twitter account. The armed forces could not immediately confirm if any of the rescued girls were among the 200 schoolgirls the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped in April 2014 from the village of Chibok. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the rescued girls and women are still being screened and none has spoken to their families yet. The 2014 mass abduction from Chibok led to an international social media movement, #BringBackOurGirls, to rescue them. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has been kidnapping females for years and has hundreds in their custody. Nigerian troops also captured and destroyed three terrorist camps in the Sambisa Forest, the armed forces said. Chibok and the Sambisa Forest are both in the northeastern part of the country. Olukolade said troops are still combing the forest. In recent weeks, Nigerian troops and vigilantes moved into the Sambisa Forest, a known hideout for Boko Haram. Last Wednesday the troops had to retreat because of explosive devices Boko Haram planted in the forest, according to military sources and a vigilante who was with the troops. On Monday, troops re-entered the forest and on Tuesday afternoon they raided two Boko Haram camps and rescued scores of girls and women. Information about the fate of the kidnapped schoolgirls has been spotty and inconsistent, with some school officials giving conflicting figures for the number of girls who were abducted or escaped their captors. \"We have no idea where the Chibok girls are or were,\" CNN correspondent Christian Purefoy said Tuesday. The name Boko Haram translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. CNN's Jennifer Z. Deaton contributed to this report. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Hotoro, Kano, Nigeria and CNN's Ralph Ellis wrote from Atlanta.",

        "article": "(CNN)Two Delaware boys are in a coma and their father still is unable to talk or move two weeks after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands, their lawyer said Saturday. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. \"The boys are in rough shape,\" Maron said. \"The family are all fighters,\" he added. \"They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.\" Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family's attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\"",

        "article": "An 18-year-old mother-of-one had two heart attacks before dying from multiple organ failure after taking M-Cat at a house party, her family have said. Abby Swinfield, from\u00a0Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was partying with friends when she was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30. Miss Swinfield, who is believed to have a son, three, was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where she was placed in a coma, but died a week later. Abby Swinfield, 18, a mother-of-one from\u00a0Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30 after a house party in Tamworth where it is thought she took M-Cat . Following Miss Swinfield's death, police have arrested one girl for supplying drugs, but Miss Swinfield's cousin has claimed she didn't take the drug voluntarily, saying her drink was spiked . Neighbours say ambulances arrived at this property at 1am. After arriving at hospital Miss Swinfield was put into a coma, but died a week later . Police are still waiting for the result of the post-mortem but it is believed the teenager had taken the illegal Class B drug Mephedrone - more commonly known as MCat or Meow Meow. Miss Swinfield's mother Kay, 39, said: 'I'm devastated. It happened at [her friend] Lauren's house. 'Abby hadn't seen Lauren in three years but she kept contacting her and saying \"come to mine for a party. We got a phone call that night saying she was at the hospital. 'Doctors told me she died of multiple organ failure after suffering two heart attacks. 'They said she'd been lying in the same position for a long time because she had a big blister on her back.' Abby's cousin Lydia Moore, 18, added: 'We don't think she took it on her own accord. We think her drink was spiked. 'Abby was a perfect girl who would be there for you if you needed it. She had an amazing heart. She had so many friends. Miss Swinfield's mother, Kay, said she is 'devastated' over her daughter's death, saying she suffered two heart attacks before dying of multiple organ failure after taking the drug . Miss Swinfield has a son, who is believed to be three years old. Her cousin\u00a0Lydia Moore, 18, said the youngster keeps asking for his mother . 'She had a beautiful son and she loved him. What's heartbreaking is her son keeps asking for his mom. Someone has taken his mom from him. The family has been torn apart.' Police have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying Class B drugs, and she has been released on bail. Staffordshire police said they have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying drugs, amid allegations Miss Swinfield's drink was spiked . Linus Pebliauskas, 29, who lives on Bridgwater Street, where the party was held, said: 'I didn't know who lived at the house but there were many young lads going in and out of there. 'There was drinking throughout the day and not just at weekends. It was a bit of a party house from what I could tell.' Yesterday a friend who was at the party, but did not want to be named, added: 'We are in absolute shock. 'There was a house party and there were loads of people there, I don't know how she got the drugs. 'She had a three-year-old boy, it is so tragic. 'Her mum Kay is absolutely distraught. She is really angry about what happened and the fact there were drugs at this party. 'She had come down to visit friends and have a good night out and now she is dead, I cannot believe it. 'She was a very popular girl and we are just completely numb at the moment. I can't get my head around it.' A spokeswoman for Staffordshire Police added: 'She has been released on police bail pending further investigation until a date in June. 'A post-mortem examination will take place in the coming days to help establish the cause of death. 'Anyone with information on the incident is urged to call Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident 790 of March 30.' Police had previously warned about the use of M-Cat in Tamworth after a raid two months ago during which 4lbs of the drug, worth thousands of pounds, was discovered.",

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said Oleg Kalashnikov, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, was found dead Wednesday evening. It said the he had died of gunshot wounds but did not say whether it was believed to be homicide or suicide. Scroll down for video . The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said Oleg Kalashnikov (pictured), a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, was found dead Wednesday evening . Kalashnikov was a former ally of deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych (pictured) Kalashnikov was a deputy for the Party of Regions in Ukraine's previous parliament. At least six former Ukrainian government officials from Yanukovych's time have died over the past two months in various circumstances that police have said were most likely suicides. Yanukovych fled in February 2014 after months of increasingly violent protests. He later resurfaced in Russia. Senior ministry official Anton Gerashchenko said . Kalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement, . which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder. The ministry had opened up a criminal case, he said. There were mass protests against Yanukovych last year in Kiev's Maidan Square . 'Without doubt the deceased knew a lot about who financed . Anti-Maidan and in what way... He takes these secrets with him . to the grave,' Gerashchenko said. On Thursday, meanwhile, a prominent Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views was shot dead  in Kiev by two masked gunmen. Oles Buzina, 45, was known for his pro-Russian opinionpieces published in Ukraine's Sevodnya daily newspaper, which is part of the media empire of Ukraine's richest businessman RinatAkhmetov.

A great-grandmother died following a stroke in hospital \u2013 after she was ignored by nurses for more than an hour, her distraught family say. Gloria Ross, 84, who spent 30 years in the National Health Service as a nurse, was found with a distorted face when she was visited by her grandson Wayne Wilkins, 25. But when he asked nurses at Whipps Cross Hospital, North East London, for help, they said Mrs Ross was \u2018just tired\u2019 \u2013 and told him the senior nurse was \u2018on a break\u2019. Mr Wilkins called his mother, Mrs Ross\u2019 daughter Maxine, 49, who rushed to the hospital and pleaded with nurses to step in. It was not until an hour had passed that Mrs Ross was finally assessed by a doctor, who realised she had suffered a stroke and arranged for her to be taken to a stroke unit at Royal London Hospital. However, she never regained full consciousness and died two weeks later. Crucially, her oxygen levels were not checked until she was seen by the ambulance crew \u2013 90 minutes after Mr Wilkins raised the alarm. They were found to be at a level where brain damage can set in. Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross. The nurses\u2019 alleged inaction occurred despite the NHS\u2019s own campaign \u2013 launched six years ago \u2013 that uses the acronym FAST, standing for Face, Arms, Speech, Time. People are told to call 999 \u2018immediately\u2019 if a suspected victim\u2019s face has fallen on one side, they cannot raise their arms or if their speech is slurred. Describing her mother\u2019s appearance after the stroke, Miss Ross said: \u2018Although she opened her eyes, she could not communicate and became agitated with pain, so was on morphine. It was awful watching her like that. \u2018There were at least four nurses on the ward at Whipps Cross but they didn\u2019t do anything until I hit the roof. \u2018My mother gave her working life to the NHS. Although she has shown early signs of dementia, she was still very much with it, still very quick apart from memory loss sometimes. Inquiry: Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross (above) and was put into special measures last month over a series of failings, has begun an investigation into the treatment of Mrs Ross . \u2018What was killing me was wondering how long my mother had been there before Wayne saw her. She still recognised us when I got to Whipps Cross so she must have been wondering why nobody was coming to help her. I want other people to be aware of what happened and for the hospital to make sure it never happens again.\u2019 Mrs Ross, a widow with four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, was being looked after by her daughter at home but was admitted to Whipps Cross after developing a urinary infection. She suffered the stroke on Sunday, March 22 and died in the Royal London on April 2. Her case comes after Barts Health Trust was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission watchdog last month due to a catalogue of failings at Whipps Cross. A Barts Health NHS Trust spokesman said: \u2018We are extremely concerned to learn of the issues raised by the family of Mrs Ross. We will be conducting an investigation.\u2019",

The 37-year-old athlete took to Facebook to write a loving message for his wife of five years. 'Congratulations Love of my Life, you inspire me every day to be a better person. I am so proud of you and everything you have accomplished on the runway. I have never met someone with more of a will to succeed and determination to overcome any obstacle in the way. 'You never cease to amaze me. Nobody loves life more then you and your beauty runs much deeper then what the eye can see. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next. I love you. \u202a#\u200eGOAT\u202c \u202a#\u200ethebestisyettocome\u202c.' She's a pro: Gisele was also seen in a delicate orange and white striped frock with nude boots . Supermodel credentials: The wife of Tom Brady oozed sex appeal as she made her turn at the end of the runway . End of an era: Gisele was the perfect model for the Colcci 2016 Summer collection .

Effortlessly cool: Gisele flashed her toned tummy in a cropped white sleeveless T-shirt and ripped jeans . Family affair: Also watching from the audience was Gisele's parents Vania and Valdir as well as her sister Gabriela . At the end of the show Gisele made one last appearance and was joined by all the other models to take a bow at the end of the runway. They all sported white T-shirts bearing the chiseled face of Gisele herself. Gisele flashed her toned tummy as she raised her arms to cheer alongside her catwalk crew and looked emotional as she bid farewell to the catwalk. Before she took to the spotlight on Wednesday, Gisele sipped on a cocktail while backstage of the show. 'Almost ready,' the supermodel captioned an image of her holding a giant piece of fruit with a straw in it as she got ready in her dressing room. Earlier in the day the Vogue staple posted a shot to Instagram as a fresh-faced 14-year-old, writing: 'I am grateful that at 14, I was given the opportunity to start this journey'. Grateful: The blonde beauty acknowledged the audience at the end of the show . That's all folks: Gisele jumped for joy as she was joined by the rest of the genetically blessed catwalk crew .

She can't stop smiling! Gisele cheerfully posed alongside designer Adriana Zucco before the show . A household name the world over, Bundchen rivals soccer legend Pele for the status of Brazil's most internationally famous citizen, and her meteoric rise from a middle-class family in a small, rural town to superstar is the stuff of modeling legend. When the iconic model announced at the weekend that she would walk her final catwalk on this week in Brazil, it marked the end of an era on the catwalk. On Wednesday she told her followers: 'Today after 20 years in the industry it is a privilege to be doing my last fashion show by choice and yet still be working in other facets of the business. #firstrunway #14yearsold.' First look at her last hurrah:\u00a0Later an image of the wife of Tom Brady was seen on the carpet. Gisele appeared to be wearing a lacy white Baby Doll dress with black straps . Flashback: Gisele\u00a0posted a fresh-faced snap aged 14 to her Instagram account on Wednesday after announcing her retiremen . Sexy: Gisele has been called the last remaining true supermodel by Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campell, pictured at the Victoria's Secrets Secret fashion Show in New York in 2003 . The 5ft 11in Amazon told a Brazilian newspaper: 'Automatically my body tells me if what I do is worth it, and it asked to stop.' She told the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper: 'I respect my body, it's a privilege to be able to stop.' B\u00fcndchen continued: 'I don't see how to continue [modeling on the catwalk]... and stopping will leave room for other projects I have for myself.' She was born and raised along with five sisters, including a fraternal twin, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, a center of German immigration to Brazil. Bundchen was discovered by a modeling agency at age 14 and she came in second place in a nationwide modeling contest, before moving to New York to work the fashion runways there. By age 20, she'd become a fashion sensation, her freckled face and flowing dirty blond locks gracing the cover of top fashion magazines worldwide and her unique combination of legginess and curves causing a sensation during her runway appearances. Bundchen's success with her healthy good looks was heralded as marking the end of the sickly skinny and bedraggled \"heroin chic\" look that had dominated runways for years. The Brazilian beauty was one of the Victoria's Secret Angels from 2000 until mid-2007. On the catwalk, the leggy supermodel pioneered the 'horse walk', a stomping movement created when a model picks her knees up high and kicks her feet out in front. However, the IMG model plans to continue with her numerous print and commercial campaigns. Running out: The Brazilian announced her retirement on Saturday marking the end of an era on the catwalk, pictured at the Victoria's Secrets show in 2002 . According to Forbes, Gisele is worth $386 million and has amassed $47 million in the last year alone, thanks to her lucrative campaigns for Chanel, Under Armour, Pantene, H&M, Carolina Herrera, and more. That amounts to her pocketing $128,000 a day - dwarfing Linda Evangelista who famously declared she wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000 . The highest-paid supermodel for the last ten years, she plans to publish a coffee table book and appear in a documentary on her life. Forbes list her as the 89th most powerful woman in the world. She ventured into acting and appeared in fashion flick The Devil Wears Prada in 2006. From 2000 to 2005, Gisele was in a relationship with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. She married NFL star Brady in 2009. The New England Patriots quarterback says he has no plans of his own to retire. The 6ft4in athlete told the Salesforce World Tour - according to the Boston Herald:\u00a0'[Boston] is where my kids were born, where they'll be raised. I'll be a lifer here.' The attractive power couple share son Benjamin, 5, and daughter Vivian, 2, and Brady has a son Jack, 7, with ex-partner Bridget Moynahan.

        "article": "For many people there is nothing worse than wasting food, especially when it comes to that half eaten loaf of bread. But now Bon Apetit has\u00a0come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven . The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread\u2019s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is . Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your \u2018watered\u2019 bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day . She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Australia has recalled its ambassador to Indonesia for consultations after two Australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early Wednesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the executions \"cruel and unnecessary\" because both men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, had been \"fully rehabilitated\" during a decade in prison. Abbott didn't say what permanent actions, if any, would be taken against Indonesia. \"This is a dark moment in the relationship, but I'm sure the relationship will be restored,\" he said. One of the men's Indonesian lawyers, Todung Mulya Lubis tweeted his apologies. \"I failed. I lost,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\" Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall, telling reporters that \"our legal sovereignty must be respected. We also respect other countries' legal sovereignty.\" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response. \"This is a legal case. This is not a political case so at this very stage, we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from Canberra,\" he said. Six other inmates were executed, including Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudil Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Indonesian Zainal Abidin and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was said to be mentally ill. On Wednesday, Brazil's foreign ministry released a statement expressing \"deep sadness\" at Gularte's execution, saying that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had urged her Indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his \"psychiatric condition.\" Gularte is the second Brazilian to be executed in Indonesia this year, with the first -- Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations. The Indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed, but at the last moment Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was spared. \"We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us,\" her mother Celia Veloso told CNN. Philippines embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. No reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on Tuesday. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio and her partner Julius Lacanilao, surrendered to authorities. The report said Sergio had denied all accusations in relation to Veloso's case. Veloso's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. A tenth prisoner, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge. Candlelight vigils were held for Chan and Sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution. The men's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay, but it wasn't to be. The men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the \"Bali Nine,\" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia. They failed. The pair were transported with other prisoners to Indonesia's so-called \"execution island\" in March, and after being given 72-hours notice of their execution on Saturday, Chan married his longtime girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, on Monday in prison. The executions of Sukumaran and Chan came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of May 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge. On Tuesday, lawyers for the men also said Indonesia's Judicial Commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing. They said three of the men's Indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on May 7. However, before the executions, Indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed. On Tuesday, the prisoners' families were heard wailing as they boarded a boat for the execution site. Visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave. Under Indonesian law, the death penalty is carried out by a 12-man firing squad, although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition. Prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit, and whether they want to wear a blindfold, hood or nothing. The shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters (16 to 33 feet), according to Amnesty International. After the executions, the rights group released a statement condemning them as \"reprehensible\" and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty. While the Bali Nine have garnered much international attention, their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking. Indonesian President Widodo has insisted that Indonesia would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a \"drugs crisis.\" He told CNN in January that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers, leading to an appeal from Chan and Sukumaran that their cases hadn't been properly considered. Lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in Kerobokan prison and were helping to counsel and support other inmates. Chan was ordained as a Christian minister who led prayer meetings, while Sukumaran became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the Bali prison. The Indonesian government didn't confirm until late Tuesday that the executions were to go ahead. Preparations were clearly underway earlier that day, with the arrival of ambulances at the port where boats leave to go to Nusa Kambangan island where the prisoners were being held. Images showed individual crosses bearing the prisoners' names and the date April 29, 2015. Families were in little doubt as to what lay ahead. When reports of his death emerged, Sukumaran's cousin tweeted: \"I love you more than you can imagine. Your legacy will live on. I promise. Save me a place in heaven.\" CNN's Tasha Tampubolon contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Two women who were part of a group that repeatedly searched Mississippi's capital city for black people to assault were sentenced Thursday to multiple years in federal prison for their role in the 2011 hate killing of 47-year-old James Craig Anderson. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Thursday sentenced Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21, of Pearl to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police. In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, Wingate also sentenced Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, of Crystal Springs to five years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit a hate crime. Went in search of black men to assault: Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21 (left) was sentenced to 8 years in prison and\u00a0Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, (left) was given 5 years for their role in the horrific 2011 murder of 47-year-old Jackson, Mississippi man James Craig Anderson . Horrific: Graves and Richards were in the car when a group of white teens drove from their suburban town after a party with the specific intent of assaulting black men in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica'. James Anderson was one of their victims. He died after being beaten and run over by a truck . Both women were riding in a truck that fatally ran over Anderson in June 2011. Anderson died after being beaten and run over. Both women read letters of apology to Anderson's bereaved family, writes the Clarion-Ledger. 'It was the worst decision of my life,' Richards said as she wept. 'I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts...and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life.' Graves told the court she's haunted every day by Anderson's face. 'I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd, and I've asked myself so many times, 'Why was I so afraid?' Graves said. 'I pray that not only God and Mr. Anderson can forgive me, but that his family can one day forgive me.' Their day of sentencing was not that day. Anderson's sister told the girls: . 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire.' Hiding their faces: The family of Shelbie Richards hide their faces from photographers outside the federal courthouse in Jackson following Richards' sentencing Thursday . Lost a brother: Anderson's sister Barbara Anderson Young told Richards and Graves in court Thursday,\u00a0'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire' Maximum sentence: Attorney Merrida Coxwell reflects on the sentencing of his client Shelbie Brooke Richards to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police . Unthinkable: Hotel surveillance video obtained by  media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Anderson's partner James Bradfield was similarly unforgiving. The days are never the same. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries...On a sunny day, all I can see is Craig out there working in the yard, trying to do everything he could for his family, and you took his life for no reason,' he said. 'And you didn't want to turn yourself in. You thought you'd get away with it.' Six white men, sentenced earlier by a different judge, received prison terms ranging from four to 50 years for Anderson's death. Two more men await sentencing after Thursday's hearings. Both Richards and Graves have acknowledged that they helped recruit people at a birthday party to take part in the venture that eventually led to Anderson's death in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica.' Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck. Hotel surveillance video obtained by The Associated Press and other media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Richards also acknowledged that later that month she lied to Jackson police detectives about the incident and her participation. The 10 defendants have pleaded guilty to other racially motivated attacks, including the beating of a black man near a Jackson golf course, the beating of another man who tried to sell the suburbanites drugs, attacks on pedestrians using beer bottles and a slingshot, and an attempt to run down another black man. Prosecutors said the suspects usually sought out people who were homeless or drunk. Other than Anderson, the black people who were assaulted have not been identified. Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon (right) to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck .",

Owners admit they spend hours watching the box with their animals and even leave it on when they are out to keep them company. And the nation's cats, dogs and pigs show a marked preference for programmes featuring other animals while shunning reality shows such as the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and TOWIE. Paul O'Grady's show 'For the Love of Dogs' is an absolute television favourite of pets .

Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre\u2019s side record a deserved victory. Celtic U17 players celebrate after beating Rangers 2-0 to win the Glasgow Cup at Hampden . Celtic goalscorer Josh Kerr holds the trophy in the air as he celebrates on Tuesday evening . Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club\u2019s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley\u2019s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie\u2019s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers\u2019 Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan. Celtic manager Ronny Deila watches the U17 side claim victory in the Glasgow Cup . Rangers manager Stuart McCall (centre), assistant Kenny Black (left) and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart watch the match from the stands at Hampden . The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill\u2019s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald\u2019s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times. Celtic players celebrate in the dressing room at the national stadium in Glasgow . He failed to take Hendry\u2019s corner when he tried to claim it with 16 minutes left and Kerr lashed in the loose ball from four yards. McCrorie\u2019s error moments later was worse, however, as he fumbled into the net when a flighted Hill free kick came in from wide on the left. Rangers tried to get back into the game and Jamieson came closest but Doohan kept him out and that sealed Celts\u2019 success.",

        "article": "A British businessman and his partner were arrested in Hong Kong yesterday after their 15-year-old daughter fell to her death from their \u00a37.5million apartment. Nick Cousins, 57, and Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, were held over alleged 'ill treatment' of their child after it emerged that her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were never registered and they did not attend school. The couple were also being questioned by police over claims that Filipino Mrs Cousins had overstayed her visa. The 15-year-old daughter of Briton Nick Cousins (left) and his partner Grace (right) fell to her death\u00a0from their multi-million pound flat in Hong Kong . Police said the girl, Blanca Cousins (right) had been unhappy and a police source said she locked herself in a bathroom before falling to her death as her parents tried to unlock the door . Police sources say Blanca (pictured) was watching television in the apartment's master bedroom while her parents watched TV in the living room shortly before the tragedy . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment block shortly after 1.46am . Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive 3 Repulse Bay Road (pictured) Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. There were claims last night that Mrs Cousins had originally moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of Mr Cousins. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. It is believed the couple had been watching television in the family's home on the 21st floor of one of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings before Blanca's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am. Blanca fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay. Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured)\u00a0the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . Blanca \u2013 who was known as Blancs \u2013 was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and was understood to have been educated at a private tuition centre along with her younger sister. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. However, not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory's strictly controlled borders, which suggests they spent their entire lives in Hong Kong. Last night, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Both of the Cousins girls appeared to have a wide circle of friends among the city's well-to-do expatriate community. Carla Cousins \u2013 Blanca's younger sister \u2013 recently posted pictures on Facebook revealing that her father had a company box at last month's Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and invited friends to join her at the event. The 21-storey apartment block is one of the city's most prestigious addresses, with four-bedroom apartments selling for \u00a37.5million each while they rent for \u00a38,000 a month. The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of \u00a37.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.' Mrs Cousins was last night still being questioned over allegedly overstaying her original visa while Mr Cousins was released on bail.

Gangs of up to six follow wealthy shoppers in the West End before stealing their cash and belongings, according to the plain-clothes officers tasked with reducing theft in the area. In one example Metropolitan Police stopped two Chilean women wearing burkas after they had been spotted targeting rich Arab tourists in the Park Lane and Mayfair areas. Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams . A bag they were carrying contained \u20ac130,000 and \u00a320,000 as well as gold and diamond jewellery. London's busy shopping areas prove a big draw for gangs of pickpockets from around the world including Romania, Algeria and Bulgaria, reports Andy Jones on\u00a0Vice. But DC Darren Bond, whose team monitors the Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street areas, explained to the the website that Chilean pickpockets 'don't mess about'. He is quoted as saying: 'They are intelligence-led \u2013 they don't go after anyone but wealthy tourists \u2013 and operate in mixed teams of three to six, often middle-aged. 'They will look like a nice family or group of businessmen to fit in. It allows them to walk through hotels unchallenged, sit down and have breakfast, then walk out with bags, laptops, etc. They are so hard to trace.' Plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like Oxford Street, pictured . He said many arrive in Britain on a six-month VISA before heading off on a 'European tour' and police are constantly monitoring CCTV to keep tabs on  gangs and their recruits. Organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in London before flying to the likes of\u00a0Madrid, Barcelona and Milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection. DC Bond, whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year, told Vice that 'anecdotally' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were Romanians or Bulgarians, ten per cent Algerians and five per cent Chileans with the rest UK-based. 'Big city theft is now organised, international crime with bosses and a hierarchy,' he added.",

The bottom-of-the-table Seasiders' relegation to League One was sealed by Rotherham's victory over Brighton on Monday, a result that condemned them to the third tier with six games of their season still to spare, and supporters vented their frustration prior to Tuesday's game. Chairman Karl Oyston was the target of their criticism as supporters congregated in front of the West Stand at 7pm to demonstrate against their owner before the directors' box windows were targeted with eggs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a flare being thrown at Blackpool's club reception . Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family .

The Blackpool Gazette were scathing in their assessment of the club's relegation to the third tier . A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Disgruntled fans chanted 'Oyston out' and 'we're relegated because of your greed' before a flare, a smoke bomb and fireworks were thrown into the cordoned-off area in front of the main entrance. Stewards and police were present but the protests did not spill over into violence. Blackpool went on to earn a point after a 1-1 draw but manager\u00a0Lee Clark admitted the club face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans. Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.'

In the clip, ISIS thugs - many of whom are wearing trainers - are recorded smashing ancient relics in Hatra . The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Elsewhere in the clip, ISIS thugs balanced precariously on ladders use a hammer to bang repeatedly on the back of carved faces on the side of the ancient walls until they topple with a crash to the ground. They are also filmed blasting Kalashnikov rifles at artefacts in the city that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The footage was posted to a militant website frequently used by the terrorist organisation. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. The fanatics claim ancient relics are 'false idols' which promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Authorities also believe they have been sold on the black market to fund their atrocities.

In between the shocking acts of destruction, the video pans to two militants speaking and brandishing their fingers directly into the camera . The slickly produced seven minute clip begins with an aerial shot over the ancient site where relics have been destroyed by ISIS . Hatra, 68 miles southwest of ISIS-held city of Mosul, is 2,000 years old and is a UNESCO World Heritage site . ISIS have destroyed ancient relics such as this in Hatra, as they violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. Pictured in civilian clothing, the ISIS thugs were seen overturning statues, destroying religious icons and replacing Christian crosses with the chilling ISIS banner. Elsewhere, ISIS went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. The jihadists also bulldozed ruins in Hatra in March. ISIS have also set off bombs around Mosul Central Library, destroying as many as 10,000 priceless and irreplaceable books and manuscripts. UN Secretary-General\u00a0Ban Ki-Moon called the Nimrud attack 'a war crime.' Hatra, 68 miles southwest of the ISIS-held city of Mosul, was a large fortified city during the Parthian Empire and capital of the first Arab kingdom. It is home to numerous temples and sculptures dedicated to gods including Apollo and Poseidon. The video comes in the wake of a major blow for ISIS, with Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit falling into the hands of the Iraqi government. Tikrit is 80 miles north of Baghdad on the main highway to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Meanwhile Isis has taken control of 90 per cent of a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus - only a few kilometres from Bashar al-Assad's stronghold. A human rights monitoring group claimed that the terror organisation almost has full control of the camp which has a population of 18,000 civilians. The United Nations said it was very concerned about the safety of the population. Chris Gunness of the UN Relief and Works agency said: 'The situation in Yarmouk is an affront to the humanity of all of us, a source of universal shame. 'Yarmouk is a test, a challenge for the international community. We must not fail. The credibility of the international system itself is at stake.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights warned that the population of the camp are under threat of death from Isis, hunger and disease. Hatra is 68 miles southwest of the city of Mosul. It dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site. The ancient city, a UNESCO world heritage site, is said to have withstood invasions by the Romans thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers. A temple to the Shamash sun god still stands more than 1,750 years after the Sassanian empire razed the Mesopotamian city. The ancient trading centre in Hatra spanned 4 miles in circumference and was supported by more than 160 towers. At its heart are a series of temples with a grand temple at the center \u2014 a structure supported by columns that once rose to 100 feet.",

        "article": "Nearly 11 months after travelling to Syria and joining Islamic State, British fighter Hamza Parvez, 22, still hasn't found a wife and has been living with a group of unmarried fighters. Known as Abu Hamza al-Britani, the loveless British Pakistani fighter recently moved back to the Islamic State de-facto capital city of Raqqa in Syria, in search of love. He is now living in a house with a group of English speaking fighters, originally as far as Belgium, Finland and Australia. Hamza Parvez (left) standing next to Belgian fighter and close friend Abu Mariya al-Belgiki have been living together in a house in Raqqa, Syria. Over six months since he travelled to Syria, Hamza's friend Abu Mariya al-Belgiki remains a frustrated bachelor. Like Hamza, all his friends appear to be struggling with life as a bachelor, with several of them taking to social media to voice their annoyance at being unable to escape their lonely life in Syria. One of Parvez's best friends, a Belgian fighter known as Abu Mariya al-Belgiki, recently wrote: 'Urgh another brother got married... The pain... LOL I'm happy for him but still... The pain...' The hapless Belgian wrote: 'But marriage for the mujahideen especially for us, who come from Europe, is a big problem here...There is no mujahiras.' 'Whenever you are going to marry someone... Their (sic) is always that guy who's better than you... U stand no chance... life reality...' Abu Hamza (left) wearing the traditional hat of the Pashtuns, and a dark robe. He is eating ice cream with his close friend Abu Hamza as-Somali in the IS held city of Mosul . Along with his best friend Mohammed Nasser, Hamza Parvez travelled to Syria in May 2014, telling his parent that he was going to Germany. Possibly on the advice of Parvez, al-Belgiki recently bought himself a pet, possibly to help him with his loneliness. The Belgian fighter proudly showed off his 'babies', a pair of green budgerigars, perched in a big cage next to a prompted back AK 47 rifle. Abu Mariya reportedly travelled to Syria last October, along with a group of up to 10 British nationals. He recently claimed that he met British fighter Siddhartha Dhar, known as Abu Rumaysah al-Britani, who travelled to Syria whilst he was on bail. The Belgian fighter proudly shows off his 'babies', a pair of green budgerigars, perched in a big cage next to a prompted back AK 47 rifle. Whilst living in Mosul, Hamza Parvez owned a kitten called Anbar. He wrote of his heartbreak at leaving behind his 'princess.' Another of Hamza's friends, Abu Ibrahim al-Finlandi, was mocked on social media after revealed his devastation in discovering his dream jihadi bride had already got engaged. According to the Finn, his wannabe bride had already got engaged to another fighter before she had even travelled to Syria. The Finnish fighter later revealed: 'Gotten so desperate that I lift my requirements. Yes my wife can be a bit older and taller than me, and ethnicity won't matter.' A FInnish fighter, whose account was recently suspended, wrote about his frustration in the process of trying to find a wife. The Finnish fighter was mocked on social media after publicly revealing his dissatisfaction at the marriage process in Islamic State territory. He went to moan about having to wait six months before he was allowed to apply to get married and 'hope a sister picks out you from hundreds of other applicants.' Parvez has also previously expressed on on his Ask.FM account that wanted to get married and have 'two or three children.' Nicknamed 'Hungry Hamza', the portly jihadi is forever posting pictures of his dinner and even claims in his profile biography that he is most likely to be found in the Islamic State kitchen. Parvez  previously said on on his Ask.FM account that he wanted to get married and have 'two or three children.' Hamza is frequently mocked for his love of junk food, possibly a major turn off for many of his potential brides. It is possible his insatiable appetite might be due to comfort eating as Hamza's family have reportedly not spoken to him for months. After studying at Holland Park School, \u00a0Parvez worked as a waiter at a hotel in Shephard's Bush, West London. Along with his best friend Mohammed Nasser, a Roehampton University business graduate, Parvez travelled to Syria in May 2014, telling his parent that he was going to Germany. He has lived in both Iraq and Syria, spending a considerable amount of time in the Iraqi city of Mosul.",

        "article": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)On Day Six of Nepal's tragedy, life triumphed as rescuers pulled an 15-year-old from the rubble of a multistory residential building in one of Kathmandu's hard-hit neighborhoods. A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone . CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

        "article": "A young mother has spoken of her fear that she could die at any moment due to a rare heart condition that should have killed her at the age of three. Betheny Coyne, from Wigan, Lancashire, was diagnosed with a rare heart defect before she was born - and was never expected to reach her fourth birthday. But she defied medical predictions and now, aged 24, she is mother to three healthy children. This is despite being warned that each pregnancy could have placed so much extra strain on her heart that she would die. Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year. Betheny Coyne, 24 (pictured with daughters Haley, Harper and Grace), was diagnosed with\u00a0a rare heart defect before she was born - and was never expected to reach her fourth birthday . Miss Coyne said: 'If I didn't have my children or my fianc\u00e9, Mark, I'd spend my life worrying I was going to die. 'I can't have any more surgery on my heart so it's a case of living with my heart defect and ensuring I do everything I want to in life while I can. 'I have defied doctors by getting this far - so we just take every day as it comes and try to take pictures of everything. 'I just want to make sure that the kids are happy and that we make lots of memories as a family as I know my condition makes me a ticking time bomb.' Miss Coyne was born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby. The condition makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body due to a narrowed aorta, the main artery that leaves the left side of the heart. The risk is that it may narrow further at any time, meaning the blood will stop going round the body properly, and in turn cause complete heart failure. Miss Coyne's parents were first told their daughter had a heart defect before she was born, but it was only later scans that revealed the true extent of the rare condition. Due to her uncertain life expectancy, Bethany wore a heart monitor to school and went for regular check-ups. She still has to go for an ultrasound scan every six months to check her heart health. Miss Coyne (with partner Mark) was born with born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby. Doctors warned being pregnant could have placed a fatal amount of strain on her heart - but once again, she defied the odds . Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year after getting engaged on holiday last year . She said: 'I worry every time I go for an appointment about what they are going to say, it's a constant uncertainty. 'Growing up with the condition was difficult because it felt so unfair that I was going into hospital all of the time for tests and check-ups while other children didn't have to. 'The possibility of dying at any moment didn't really affect me until I had children. 'You just get on with life when it's just you, but when you have kids you have more responsibility and something to live for.

The risk is that it may narrow further at any time, meaning the blood will stop going round the body properly, and in turn cause complete heart failure and death. 'Now I worry about it all the time, but knowing that we are taking lots of pictures and have the wedding to look forward to makes it easier. 'It was only when I was told I probably shouldn't have children that I realised how much I wanted to have them. I knew I'd regret it if I never became a mum.' She became pregnant with her first child, Haley, unexpectedly when she was 19 - and before she met her now fianc\u00e9, Mark. She had previously been warned by her heart specialist that having children would cause a massive strain on her heart. She said: 'I was really worried when I fell pregnant, but I tried to live as normal a life as possible and focused on the baby.' Thankfully, her heart condition is not genetic, so there was little chance of her passing it onto her children. Speakiing about giving birth to her daughter in 2009, she said: 'I was so relieved. When I gave birth it went so well - it was completely normal.' The following year, she met her fianc\u00e9 Mark Brimble, 35, in a local bar . Aware of the seriousness of her condition, she told him about it early on in the relationship.

She is pictured at Disneyland Paris . She said: 'When I told him, I actually offered to leave him because I could see how it might get difficult later on. 'He was so understanding, though, he's been great the whole time we've been together.' On February 20 2013, Miss Coyne gave birth to the couple's first child, Grace - and was induced four days early as a precaution for her heart condition. Mr Brimble then proposed last May while they were on holiday and baby Harper arrived in the December. Miss Coybe said: 'We don't want any more children - the main thing now is having a great time with the three we have. 'Before Harper was born we took the girls to Disneyland Paris for Haley's fourth birthday and we had the best time. However there are constant reminders of her condition. At times, breathing can be very difficult and there are days when she feels exhausted. She said: 'Mark is an amazing dad, so I would have no worries about the children if I died.' June Davidson, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Years of research has helped to dramatically improve survival rates for babies born with congenital heart defects from a position where very few babies survived to one where almost all do.' 'However, more research is needed to better understand the longer term consequences of living with congenital heart disease so we can further improve the quality of more people's lives.'",

        "article": "A New Zealand man was taken aback after receiving a phone call from his brother who had been missing for 10 years. John Daniel Tohill, 37, was last heard from by family in 2005 after he left Nelson on the Tasman bay to travel north. But on Tuesday evening his brother Tobias received a call from John saying he had would be visiting in the coming weeks, reports\u00a0Stuff NZ. John Daniel Tohill, 37, made contact with his family this week for the first time since 2005 . Over the years his family has hired investigators and police, but because he was an adult and had disappeared without notice before there was little incentive for police to appeal to the public for information. The family learned that John had never left the country, had no savings and did not possess a driver's licence. But after a call out for public sightings of him, John called his brother on Tuesday. 'It's pretty amazing,' Tobias said. 'He wanted to keep to himself all this time.' He was reportedly alerted to the search by a colleague who showed him the story on Stuff NZ. Tobias said his brother offered little explanation to his disappearance. John's brother Tobias (pictured) received a call from John saying he had would be visiting them in coming weeks . 'He is happy. He sounds well. He sounds like his is in a good way. We were very happy to hear from him.' John will visit his family in the coming weeks, including his father, who is in the final stage of dementia. 'It's a bit strange,' Tobias said. 'It's really good to hear he is well. I don't have to think about it any more.'",

        "article": "Spotted: Pippa Middleton is said to have been buying up the mull-cloth nappies in Geneva . With the birth now imminent, relatives of the forthcoming Royal baby will be ready to shower the newborn with expensive gifts from London\u2019s smartest shops. But the Duchess of Cambridge may be in line for a more practical present for her baby \u2013 a supply of biodegradable nappies from her sister, Pippa Middleton. At \u00a34 each, the mull-cloth nappies are not cheap and they are yet to really catch on in the UK. But they are all the rage in Europe and Pippa, 31, may have learned of their merits during one of her frequent trips to Switzerland where her boyfriend Nico Jackson lives. Shoppers in Geneva have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies in a shop there. Most of their appeal comes from the fact that they are made from natural fibres \u2013 meaning, unlike conventional nappies, they don\u2019t end up in landfill heaps. Kate is unlikely to be too concerned about their cost but will know that using eco-friendly nappies will please the baby\u2019s grandfather, Prince Charles, a keen environmentalist. Pippa will be aware that Kate adores natural clothing materials. The first photograph taken of Prince George as the family left St Mary\u2019s hospital in London in 2013 showed him wrapped in organic muslin cotton swaddling from a clothing brand Aden + Anais. Pippa has also recently been seen visiting a high-end baby boutique in Geneva where she enquired about a \u00a3140 rocking chair. She has also spent a \u2018small fortune\u2019 on baby grows from clothing brand Ars\u00e8ne et les Pipelettes, according to an eyewitness. Eco-friendly: The nappies are very popular in Switzerland, but have yet to catch on in the UK . She bought in neutral colours, suggesting that even she has not been told whether Kate is expecting a boy or a girl. Last night supporters of the Duke and Duchess were camped outside the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, London, where the Duchess is expected to give birth imminently.",

        "article": "For more than 2,000 years, invaders have been fighting over glorious Kefalonia.\u00a0Romans, the Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, the French, British and, during the Second World War, the Italians and Germans have all left their mark. Fortunately, the present settlers - the Greeks themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism. So instead of fast-food restaurants you will find charming family-run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven. Great forests of pines, cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides, often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at Dover, or in fine shingle and sand beaches, fringing a sea whose warm, sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity. The famous curve of Myrtos beach, as well as many little inland villages, are seen on the road to Fiscardo . Inland, the roads, winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic. We landed at the island's only airport near the capital town of Argostoli, took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of Spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday. Richard Johnson rejoices in unspoiled Kefalonia . We were staying first at the superb Villa Hephaestus. The view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed, my American wife called it 'awesome'. The sweep of Lourdas Bay, with its long sandy beaches, was spread out below us, while the neighbouring island of Zakynthos\u00a0could be seen in the misty distance. Hephaestus is a modern villa with a well-equipped kitchen, and we love to cook. However, after a long day travelling, we decided we needed restorative cocktails, a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner. Not fancying driving along twisting lanes, we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded Water Way restaurant at Spartia beach. The proprietor is a local fisherman, so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen, which is presided over by his wife, while his charming daughter Tepsi is in charge of front of house. From Lourdas Bay you can see Zakynthos Island, where the beautiful Shipwreck Beach (pictured) is found . A sweeping view across the turquoise waters of Lourdata Bay and the white stands of Lourdas Beach . The island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent, so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day. We checked out the string of beaches around Lourdas Bay and found plenty of good restaurants. At the top of a flight of easy steps from Lourdas beach, we found Lorraine's Magic Hill restaurant, with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband's organic farm. The portions are generous and there's a great view across the bay to fellow Ionian isle Zakynthos. The popular Skala beach is just at the end of the bay. The Metaxa Beach Bar is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas. We shopped for supplies for our evening meals at Argostoli's port. One can buy catch-of-the-night fish straight from the boats that line the quay (park where you like, for free). The popular golden Skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby Metaxa Beach Bar good for coffee . The town of Argostoli's port is ideal for picking up supplies, including catch-of-the-night fish  from the boats . Enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of St George, near Peratata, and the monastery of St Ayos. At both places entrance is free, and don't miss the Castle cafe just outside the gates. Its enthusiastic proprietors are Greek/English and serve superior food in a shady garden. The Monastery of Saint Geronimo is situated in a vine-clad valley north-east of the castle. It was rebuilt in Byzantine-style in the 1960s, the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake. The walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes, and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling. We loved our stay in the south, but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to Fiscardo, on the island's north cape. The trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of Myrtos beach\u00a0- as well as many little inland villages. Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, has been transformed into a world-class yachting centre, with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside. The second week of our stay was a 35-mile drive away in the fishing village of Fiscardo , in the island's north . 'It's like St Tropez in the old days,' I mused. Our villa, Island View, is set on the hillside overlooking the port. From its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of Ithaca - mythical home of Odysseus - and Lefkas could be seen through the shimmering sea mist. We found some attractive beaches a few minutes' drive from Fiscardo. Our two favourites were Agia Jerusalem\u00a0and Alaties, both reached by turning right out of the village of Maganos and following the signs. Agia Jerusalem is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August. When we visited (in September), fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided. Agia Jerusalem Beach is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August, and a favourite of the writer . There's an excellent taverna, with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily. Alaties, on the other hand, is a tiny cove with a miniature beach. It's lovely to swim there. Among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had. Apart from one afternoon of rain (we were on a boat trip to Lefkas but 30 minutes out of Fiscardo, an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip), the weather was perfect. We had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery, great food and fun when we wanted it. I can see why so many people have wanted to invade Kefalonia!",

        "article": "Forget stumbling into the kitchen in the small hours and waiting for milk to heat up with a screaming baby on your arm. A self-warming bottle that heats up in 60 seconds is among the latest gizmos designed to make new mums' lives easier. While muslin squares and cotton wool have been go-to products for mums for generations, gadgets on the market in 2015 include a machine that makes 'shushing' sounds to 'break the cycle of crying' and biodegradable nappies which don't clog up landfill. Scroll down for video . The new royal baby could be clad in eco-friendly biodegradable mull-cloth as opposed to disposable nappies . Pippa Middleton, left, is said to have bought the biodegradable nappies for her new royal niece or nephew . Pippa Middleton is among those embracing eco-friendly nappies and is said to have invested in \u00a34-a-piece mull-cloth nappies for her sister the Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the birth of the new royal baby. Shoppers in Geneva, Switzerland, have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies, which are made of natural fibres and are popular in Europe. While re-usable and biodegradable nappies are easier on the planet and will no doubt get Prince Charles' seal of approval there is also a wealth of products to make parenthood easier - whether you're royal or not. Yoomi's self-warming baby bottle promises to gently warm a baby's feed to the natural temperature of breast milk in just 60 seconds, meaning there's no need for Wills to even get out of bed when helping with night-time feeds. And if they're having trouble settling the baby and need to resort to the pushchair the royal couple can pace around the grounds of Kensington Palace in safety thanks to Buggi Lights flashing ladybirds, which clip on to the pushchair's chassis and come with\u00a0white forward facing and red rear facing flashing lights - just like a car. There's no need to get cold hands while trying to get the baby to sleep either: Mummy Mitts attach to the handle bars of the pushchair, meaning you can take your hands out while the mittens remain attached. Headlights for the pushchair and a baby 'shusher' are among the latest gadgets for mums... ...or why not try mittens that attached to the pushchair or a giraffe to rock the crib? Koo-di's spout protector is also among the list of products you never knew you needed, stopping\u00a0baby touching hot bath taps and protecting against bumps, with heat spots that change colour to indicate temperature. When it comes to bedtime the Baby Shusher puts an end to pacing round the living room for hours on end: with rhymic 'shush' sounds the device can be programmed to make 15 minutes or 30 minutes of continuous shushing. And if that doesn't work patent-pending Gerry the Giraffe attaches to car seat, cribs and baby bouncers to rock the baby for up to 30 minutes - just enough time to get your nails done. But if baby isn't sleeping because they're poorly look no further than the Spilly Spoon, a non-spill medicine spoon which promises to administer medicine without spilling it first. A self-warming bottle and a spout protector are other gadgets on offer . The Spilly Spoon is designed to look like a caterpillar and administer medicine without spilling it . 'There's a mind-boggling array of infant devices on the market, but just because something exists doesn't mean that anyone actually needs\u00a0it,' Justine Roberts, CEO of parenting website Mumsnet, told MailOnline. 'For first time parents, it's almost impossible to predict which baby products will turn out to be essentials and which will gather dust in the cupboard. Feeding: muslin squares . Sleeping: Moses basket . Clothing: Babygros, scratch mittens . Medicine: Gripe water, Calpol . Toys: Fisher Price Chatter Telephone . 'One family will find that a multi-purpose travel system fits in perfectly with their needs; another may realise that all they need for transport is a sling.' And what would Sister Julienne, Call the Midwife's profoundly practical chief midwife - or your Granny - have to say? While there's no doubt many of today's modern gadgets can make life easy for new parents, when it comes to babies there are some things which have transcended time. Muslin squares, scratch mittens and Babygros still feature on 'must have' hospital bag lists, and many new mums come home from hospital and place their bundles of joy in Moses baskets. 'Our users also find that talking to other parents - about what you do and don't need to buy, how to budget, and the realities of day-to-day finances with an extra mouth to feed - is priceless,' says Mumnet's Roberts.",

        "article": "MaiquetIa, Venezuela: it's a long way from Bundoran \u2014 and a long way from the Belfast homes of Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan. The pair mischievously claimed that Donegal's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-Olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at London 2012, but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current Olympiad. Barnes may have already been well known in Ireland prior to their achievements in London, but taking up his part in a charming double act with Conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights. Conlan (leff) lands a right jab on Matthew Martin during his bantamweight bout in Glasgow in 2014 . The reality of making that happen is far more complex, of course, and the efforts of Barnes and Conlan to make it to Rio 2016 are unprecedented. On Saturday night, the Belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer's Olympic Games, with Barnes needing to ensure victory while Conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere. Their mission takes them to Maiquetia, northern Venezuela, where they will take on native opposition, the latest stop on the road-trip that is the World Series of Boxing (WSB) \u2014 a part of the convoluted new structure that once was 'amateur' boxing. WSB boxers are part of a franchise team, fighting individually over five three-minute rounds in a pro-style format. Barnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team, but the sights and sounds of Milan and Rome were not what drew them to the competition. In fact, they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in Italy and while most WSB fighters receive payment, the Irish pair signed up with Olympic qualification as their sole motivation. Upon their return to Belfast after Saturday night's fight, they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips. That is the equivalent of three trips from Dublin to Melbourne. They will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and, as of today, Barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to Conlan's 28. They are burnt out, peeved off and ready for rest \u2014 but only once their mission is complete Saturday night. Barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in Rio . 'I just feel tired, I'm sick of it,' laments a worn-out Barnes, who is an undefeated 6-0. 'To fight every fortnight, travelling around the world, it's doing my head clean in. I'll be glad to get out of it. Hopefully I qualify and some good will have come from it. 'I was flying to Kazakhstan and I felt like crying on the plane, I felt like pulling out. I was very, very close. I think I was in Heathrow and I was going to get a plane back to Belfast. 'If I didn't qualify for the Olympics through this WSB, I'd have nothing to do with it. I've been training from November right through and then I'd need to go to the Europeans [Games] in June \u2014 I couldn't do that, like. I physically couldn't do that, it'd be impossible.' In addition to hand injuries, which have severely limited his training, Barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first Irish boxer ever to reach a third Olympic Games. 'I hate flying, I just hate it, it depresses me even thinking about it. I can't even sleep, I'm that scared. I can't sleep, can't watch films, can't read books, I'm just too panicky, too nervous. 'I'll not even be able to drink water, never mind a beer to relax, because I'll be making weight.' If he sounds like a touch grouchy, it is understandable. While their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as Guba in Azerbaijan, Palermo, Poland's Konin, Almaty in Kazakhstan, Rome, Milan and now Maiquetia, the two-time Olympic medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities. 'Far from it,' says Barnes. 'You go away and you have to go to the worst areas, there's nothing extravagant about it. It's not five star \u2014 it's one-and-a-half star. 'You can't really see too much because we're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we're training to make the weight\u2026 We're home the next day [after the fight] in the early hours. So we're more or less in and out.' Michael Conlan (left) and Paddy Barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at London 2012 . Adding to Barnes' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light-flyweight limit. The 28-year-old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh-in demeanour are common, with Conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room-mate. 'It does make it easier because we're mates outside boxing,' says Barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal. 'We're travelling together and fighting together so it is good, I'd rather that then going away on my own because I think I'd pack it in. It's too much of a strain. 'But when we're away, I barely talk to him because he knows I'm making weight!' Conlan, the laidback member of the double act, takes a far more carefree approach to travel. 'Getting on a plane doesn't bother me, if you're going to die on a plane, you're going to die,' laughs Conlan. 'A lot of the flights I try and sleep through so I'll be waking up in their [local] time.' The 23-year-old recently became a father, with his young daughter just four weeks old, while Barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months. The pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since Conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend's presence on WSB duty. 'It's good for both of us because I know when I'm training with him, we're both training hard and pushing each other,' says Conlan. 'Everything we've done up until this WSB since 2012 has been the exact same \u2014 Olympic bronze, European silver, Commonwealth gold. The fact that this WSB has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we're still going well,' adds Conlan, who is in qualification limbo after two disputed 'away' points decisions, increasing the temptation to turn pro . 'Winning [tonight] isn't going to be a problem, I'm just waiting on other results. It's a bit of a sickener, but it has to be done at the end of the day. I have to get in there and do what I have to do and win, do my part of the job.' 'I'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me, but I have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things,' says Conlan. 'Hopefully it all works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.' For Barnes, he maintains: 'The Olympic Games is what it's all about, it's every amateur boxer's dream and if I qualify, I'll be honoured to say I qualified for my third Olympic Games.'",

        "article": "(CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? \"She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to\" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. \"That's the kind of person Trey is,\" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read \"Let's Party Like it's 1989,\" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. \"You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,\"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. \"You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect.\" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. \"I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,\" she said, but \"this school, this year has been a relief.\" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids . Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. \"It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,\" she said. \"Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son.\" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. \"Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping\" her mother said. \"Because I've only told about a million people!\" Ellie interjected.",

        "article": "Veteran Burnley defender Michael Duff believes manager Sean Dyche could one day take charge of England. Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it.

The Lib Dem leader wants existing phone appointments extended so doctors can see patients on video calls. Some patients would be uncomfortable with the the prospect of exposing their ailments to their GP over the web. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg wants existing phone appointments extended so doctors can see patients on video calls . Mr Clegg today met patients and staff at Bodmin Community Hospital in Cornwall as he campaigned in the Lib Dem stronghold in the South West . But officials stressed that people would not be forced use the service and insisted it would only be for minor ailments or progress checks. They said it could be used for update appointments, brief progress checks or for when patients needed 'reassurance'. They pointed out many GPs surgeries already use phone appointments which video call services like Skype or FaceTime would improve. The Lib Dems also want repeat prescriptions and booking appointments to be made available online. The Liberal Democrat leader committed to using \u00a3250million from the sale of NHS assets deemed to be redundant to fund the use of technology in a drive to create a 'paperless health service' in England. The money would come from the sale of assets including land and buildings such as former accommodation blocks. The Lib Dems said their plans would mean the ability to pay for five million more operations than the Conservatives, and allow them to hire 150,000 more nurses and 38,000 more GPs than Labour . Mr Clegg said: 'The NHS doesn't need warm words, it needs hard cash. And we know exactly how much because the boss of NHS England has told us - an extra GBP8 billion-a-year by 2020. 'The Liberal Democrats are the only party that has committed to finding that money and the only one that has set out how it will pay for it. 'But we also need to help the NHS adapt so it is fit for the challenges of the 21st century. 'That's why we have a plan to introduce modern technology that will help patients, with more doctors' appointments and repeat prescriptions at the touch of a button.' Mr Clegg, who was visiting Bodmin Community Hospital as part of his election tour, said: 'Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron have ignored the experts on this. Only the Liberal Democrats have listened.' The party claims that they would spend \u00a317 billion more than the Tories and \u00a37 billion more than Labour on the NHS. The Lib Dems said their plans would mean the ability to pay for five million more operations than the Conservatives, and allow them to hire 150,000 more nurses and 38,000 more GPs than Labour.",

        "article": "An impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life-saving treatment for his three morbidly-obese children. Sisters Yogita Rameshbhai Nandwana, five, and Anisha, three, and their 18-month-old brother Harsh, are among the world's heaviest young children. Weighing 5st 5lbs (34kg), 7st 8lbs (48kg) and 2st 5lbs (15kg) respectively, the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month. Now their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 34, of Gurjarat, India, is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists. He said: \u2018If my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues. We\u2019re terrified they will die.\u2019 Scroll down for video . Obese: (From left) Yogita, five, Harsh, 18 months, and Anisha, three, weigh 5st 5lbs (34kg), 2st 5lbs (15kg) and 7st 8lbs (48kg) respectively . Yogita and Anisha eat 18 chapatis, 3lbs of rice, two bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits, 12 bananas and a litre of milk daily. And their extreme hunger means their mother Pragna Ben, 30, spends most of her day making their meals. She said: \u2018My day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning. After that I am again in the kitchen preparing more food. \u2018Their hunger never stops. They demand food all the time and cry and scream if they\u2019re not fed. I am always in the kitchen cooking for them.\u2019 The couple have one older daughter, Bhavika, six, who weighs an average 2st 7lbs (16kg), and do not know why their other three children are so big. Mr Nandwana said: \u2018When Yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg (3.3lbs). We were worried for her health. 'So we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg (1st 12lbs). Family: Rameshbhai Nandwana (left), 34, and Pragna Ben (back right), 30, are the parents of Yogita (front left), Anisha (front right), Harsh (front centre) and six-year-old Bhavika (rear centre), their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs. They all live together in\u00a0Gujarat, India . \u2018Our third daughter Anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg. \u2018But we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son Harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year. 'We started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that I couldn\u2019t afford.\u2019 Mr Nandwana earns just Rs 3000 (\u00a335) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children. He said: \u2018I am a daily wage labour and I usually get paid Rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all. \u2018I work in fields, dig wells, and do whatever menial job I can find to earn money. 'And I\u2019m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children.\u2019 Despite his paltry income, Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (\u00a3110) a month on food for his children and said he 'cannot leave them starving' Diet:\u00a0Yogita and Anisha eat eight chapatis, 4lbs of rice, three bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily . Mother of four: Pragna Ben, 30, tries to lift her five-year-old daughter Yogita . 6am . Five bananas . One litre of milk . Six wheat chapatis . One bowl of vegetable broth . 10am .

Six wheat chapatis . One litre of milk . Buttermilk (1.5 litres) Two big bowls of vegetables . He added: \u2018If I don\u2019t have the money, I borrow it from my brothers and friends. But I make sure I feed my children when they need.\u2019 The father has spent Rs 50,000 (\u00a3540) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years \u2013 without any improvement in his children\u2019s condition. He said: \u2018No one in our family has a giant frame. Only my children are overweight. As parents, it pains us immensely to see them unable to move. \u2018They cannot walk; they cannot do anything on their own. Selling my kidney is a desperate measure. But I\u2019m now desperate to get the right help for my children.\u2019 Miss Ben cannot pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around. She said: \u2018They need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet. I\u2019m only 40 kg so it\u2019s impossible for me to pick them up. \u2018It\u2019s a struggle when my husband is at work. Hard-working: Anisha hugs her father Rameshbhai, with Harsh.\u00a0Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (\u00a3110) a month on food for his children . 'They are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that, they cannot go to school. 'All they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other. 'I want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids. I want them to have a life. This is no life.\u2019 Local doctors believe the children are suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, but do not know how to treat it. The rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger, reduced muscle tone, restricted growth and learning difficulties. Dr Akshay Mandavia, a paediatrician at Mandavia Children's Hospital in Gujarat, said: \u2018There is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children. \u2018They\u2019re not able to breathe properly, and they wheeze. Their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or Prader-Willi syndrome. \u2018But we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals.\u2019 Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. These include: . It is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15, which happens purely by chance, and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests. Sadly, there is no cure for the condition. Prader-Willi syndrome\u00a0is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating. Parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food . Instead, a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has, such as overeating. Children usually want to eat frequently, so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories, and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted. Getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible, so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods, such as fridge or cupboards. They should also search the child\u2019s room for hidden foods, forbid them to leave the house unsupervised, or play with other children who are eating food, in case they try to steal it. Any family, friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet. The child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible. If the child has restricted growth, treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone (HGH) is usually recommended, as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm (4.1 inches). Most adults with Prader-Willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives, such as having a full-time job and living in their own home. Their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding. Adults with the syndrome who don't live with their parents will probably require residential care. Source: NHS Choices .

A flabbergasted Mario Draghi held his hands up for protection when the demonstrator leapt on to the podium and began throwing paper at him during a press conference. The woman - who identified herself later as Josephine Witt - yelled 'End the ECB dictatorship!' before being bundled off by two heavyset guards, while a third threw himself in front of Mr Draghi. The protester flashed a V-for-victory sign and smiled as the two men in grey suits carried her away by her arms and legs while the ECB boss was taken into a side room. Flabbergasted: Ex-Femen activist Josephine Witt throws confetti at European Central Bank President Mario Draghi during a press conference in Frankfurt, Germany . Taken by surprise: Mr Draghi held his hands up for protection when the demonstrator leapt on to the podium and began throwing paper at him . Police said the woman was 21 and from Hamburg.\u00a0Miss Witt said she was formerly associated with Feminist activist group Femen. But the organisation, known for topless protests against what it sees as male 'economic, cultural and ideological occupation', claimed responsibility for the demonstration. Mr Draghi returned minutes later looking a little shaken but resumed his press conference, earning a small round of applause from the press corps at the end for his composure. ECB news conferences are usually sombre affairs, attended by reporters concerned with technical matters such as quantitative easing and asset-backed securities. Taken down: The woman yelled 'End the ECB dictatorship!' before being bundled off by two heavyset guards, while a third threw himself in front of Mr Draghi . Defiant: Police, who took her into custody after the incident in Frankfurt, said she was 21 and from Hamburg . 'The rest of the press conference could hardly match the excitement of the first minutes,' investment bank ING said of Wednesday's event. #Draghi became a trending hashtag on Twitter - a rare event for a central banker.\u00a0An ECB spokesman said the bank was investigating the incident. Some left-wing activists accuse the ECB of enforcing budget austerity measures on eurozone countries, such as Greece, that are under financial bailout programs. It has also been accused of having too few women in top positions. As attention returned to ECB policy, Mr\u00a0Draghi said the bank intends to pursue its existing bond-buying stimulus program 'until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.' Feminist activist group Femen, known for topless protests against what it sees as male 'economic, cultural and ideological occupation', claimed responsibility for the stunt . The protester flashes a V-for-victory sign and smiled as the two men in grey suits carried her away by her arms and legs while Draghi was taken into a side room . Inflation at minus 0.1 per cent is way below the ECB's aim of 2 per cent. There was some speculation that because of a recent improvement in the economy of the 19-country eurozone, the ECB might end its stimulus program before that date. In his statement, Mr Draghi noted that the ECB would look beyond month-by-month swings in economic data when assessing how long to carry on with the stimulus. The stimulus hopes to lower market interest rates, which tends to boost lending and, by extension, economic activity. The U.S. Federal Reserve has used a similar program. Mr Draghi said the stimulus program is proceeding smoothly and has helped lower market interest rates.",

United are third, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who they face on Saturday and play second placed Arsenal in their penultimate league game. Smalling scored United's fourth goal in their 4-2 derby demolition. It means he has now scored the same amount of Premier League goals this season as former teammate Danny Welbeck at Arsenal with four. Chris Smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic City defence to Ashley Young's free-kick . Smalling is greeted by Juan Mata following his goal in Manchester United's impressive win over their rivals . He said: 'It\u2019s massive [to win six in a row]. I think a lot of people probably saw our fixtures as the hardest of the lot, but if you play teams like Tottenham and Liverpool and win, they\u2019re real six-pointers. It makes a massive difference, and I think confidence comes from beating these top teams. 'We weren\u2019t ourselves in the first 15 minutes, but we dominated from there on. 'We came in at half-time and Giggsy said it was a good show of character to come back from a goal down, but in the second half we needed to get the ball down and take a few more risks. Mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy and poise . 'We were a bit cautious and didn\u2019t try to play out [from the back] too much, but in the second half we really kicked on and made a print on the game.

The Milat Letters, is a compilation of\u00a094 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she\u2019s 25, white. I ought to ask her \u201cwhy\u201d as she only knows me from a website, and there\u2019s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Scroll down for video . Ivan Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992\u00a0in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . Ivan Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. Now, Shipsey, a 55-year-old former Rebels bikie gang member who has been banned from visiting Milat in prison, says he has released the book of his uncle's letters for 'those who want to read the facts.' 'I have done this purely to show how the system can vilify a person without giving them a fair trial or a chance to appeal to his convictions,' Shipsey says on his Milat Letter Facebook page. The book's blurb reads: \u2018Innocent or guilty?' and Shipsey promises \u2018you won\u2019t be able to put it down\u2019. \u2018They say he had someone or others with him \u2013 but we will never know. He still denies his guilt in the brutal murders that were carried out in the Belanglo forest between 1989 and 1992. He has been inside for twenty years now,' the promo reads. The 55-year-old former Rebels bikie gang member has compiled the letters into a $32 book . Titled 'The Milat Letters', Shipsey (left) promises 'you won\u2019t be able to put it down'.\u00a0Ivan Milat (right) is currently serving seven life sentences . Some of Milat's letters detail his correspondence with women from the United States, Japan and Australia in the years he has been behind prison bars,  News.com.au reports. 'I get my share of women writing to me - some real good looking ones, too (if it\u2019s their photographs they\u2019re sending),'\u00a0Milat wrote. 'For some reason, they all say they\u2019re around 20 to 30 years old, though their writing suggests they\u2019re much older. I\u2019m very careful of my replies. I\u2019m not real keen writing to the young ones.' One woman, who has written to Milat from the day he was charged in 1994, is Margaret, one of two women he was\u00a0acquitted of raping at knife-point in 1971. During his trial, Milat's then-lawyer successfully argued that the girls were liars. 'I still hear from Margaret who is writing to me, though I think someone presses her button just to see what I say. This crazy sheila (in her 50s now) has been writing to me ever since my arrest and sending me weird photos. She is unbelievable,' Milat wrote. 'I get my share of women writing to me - some real good looking ones, too (if it\u2019s their photographs they\u2019re sending),' Milat wrote to his nephew Alistair Shipsey, who has released a book of his letters . In one letter, Milat, a former road worker, told his nephew he thinks \u00a0HenryVIII - who had two of his wives beheaded - 'had the right idea how to deal with women' In another letter, Milat tells his nephew he has also been propositioned. 'Why they write to me is a puzzle. I often get letters, even had some crazy f... from Mulewa prison writing to me (I used to write to her in the past - she was doing a few years and got out but it lasted about three months),' Milat wrote.\u00a0'She started writing again; in her last letter she asked me to marry her. I haven\u2019t replied yet.' But Milat doesn't seem to be particularly enamoured by the writers of any of his love letters. In one note, he tells Shipsey he thinks HenryVIII - who had two of his wives beheaded - 'had the right idea how to deal with women'. Shipsey says Milat doesn't like talking about 'sexual things'. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . The first two bodies of Milat\u2019s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl\u2019s stabbed body in November of the same year. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . In prison, Milat has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape and swallowing metal objects so he could get out of jail. Other extracts from his letters, tell 'Al' why he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in prison in January 2009. \u2018I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k.' Milat tried to send his finger it in a padded envelope to the High Court. 'I do battle to cope with this sh***y claustrophobic place, no windows, it's like a cement coffin. I suffer badly at times, I think the walls close in, no air, it's a real sh*t feeling, no I will never plead with the p***s.' British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . Alistair Shipsey says the new book gives readers the chance to picture what a prison cell 'does to a man's mind over years.' 'This is in his words not someone making a story up, he didn't know I was ever going to do this so there's no lies in it, just facts,' Shipsey says. 'You can read the way he lives in supermax in his cement coffin.' On a Facebook page used to advertise the book, Shipsey makes his thoughts around his uncle\u2019s imprisonment clear and blames the media for not reporting the real facts. He says no money from the $32 book\u2019s sales will go to Milat because \u2018he doesn\u2019t need it where he is.\u2019 Daily Mail Australia has contacted Shipsey for comment. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope .",

Desperate for a home in 2013, Davion Navar Henry Only dressed up in a suit and borrowed a Bible from the boys home where he lived. Then he headed to a St. Petersburg, Florida, church to make a plea for his own adoption. Now 16 years old, he had lived his entire life in foster care, bouncing from one home to another. The older he got, the less likely it was that he would be adopted. But the Tampa Bay Times documented his journey, and a video of his plea went viral. Thousands of calls came into his agency, and a minster's family in Ohio asked him to come live with them. But he got into a fight with one of their sons, and they sent him back to Florida. Forever wasn't forever in that case. And to the people who asked what went wrong, his social worker had the answer. \"That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,\" Connie Going told the Tampa Bay Times. Photo helps gets teen adopted . For a year, he went through four more foster homes and wouldn't speak about what happened in Ohio. Finally, he reached out to Going, the woman who had been there for him since he was 7. Only had repeatedly asked her to adopt him, but she didn't think that she could be enough for him. She already had three children, ages 21, 17 and 14. But something changed in that latest call, and she knew she would finally say yes. So did her three children.

However despite the fox\u2019s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide \u2018with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day\u2019s photography.\u2019 However Mr Byng\u2019s relaxing day\u2019s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. \u2018I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,\u2019 explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. \u2018I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.\u2019 Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. \u2018The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. \u2018It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. \u2018Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . \u2018It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. \u2018The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!\u2019 The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK.

        "article": "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Monday for the first time since world powers and Iran sealed a framework agreement on April 2 that would limit Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon. They now have little more than two months to meet their own deadline of June 30 to sign a comprehensive accord, which hinges on both sides coming to an agreement on the timing of sanctions relief. The Obama administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with Iran, with talks between top U.S. and Iranian diplomats at a United Nations conference in New York and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical American lawmakers and constituencies in Washington. In this March 16 photo, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, listens to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, right, during diplomatic talks about Iran's nuclear program in Lausanne, Switzerland. Kerry and Zarif met today at the United Nations on the sidelines of a conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in which both men are participating for the first time since a framework agreement was reached earlier this month . Kerry and Zarif reconvened at the Upper East Side home of Iran's ambassador to the United Nations today after their marathon negotiations in Switzerland with several questions outstanding. Kerry is pictured here today giving remarks at the U.N. nuclear proliferation conference in New York . In the nation's capitol, lead U.S. negotiator Wendy Sherman told a conference of reform Jews that diplomatic collapse would leave Iran perilously close to nuclear weapons capacity. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said a final agreement would in some ways be tougher than what the U.S. has outlined thus far. All the activity was taking place as the Senate begins debate over empowering Congress to review and possibly reject any nuclear pact. Republican presidential candidates are lining up to oppose any deal with a government the U.S. considers the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and to show their support for Israel. Marco Rubio of Florida wants to require Iran's leaders to publicly accept Israel's right to exist, a nearly impossible mandate. Ted Cruz of Texas hopes to put the onus on advocates to win congressional approval of a deal, and not on opponents to gather enough votes for rejection. But even as the legislation moves forward, House Speaker John Boehner privately acknowledged to a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition over the weekend that his party doesn't command enough votes to override a presidential veto of any resolution disapproving of an Iran deal, BloombergView reported. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, didn't dispute the report. 'Obviously, it takes only a fraction of the House and Senate Democrats to sustain a veto, but it is impossible to say whether they will or not until we know what the final 'deal' looks like,' Steel told the Associated Press. President Barack Obama is pictured here showing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall today. His administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with Iran, with talks between top U.S. and Iranian diplomats at the United Nations conference in New York and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical American lawmakers and constituencies in Washington . Prime Minister Abe is in the nation's Capital to discuss a range of economic, security, and global issues, including progress on the Trans Pacific Partnership, Japan's expanding role in the Alliance, and climate change. The two national leaders are pictured here from behind, still at the Lincoln Memorial, facing the Washington Monument . Kerry and Zarif reconvened at the Upper East Side home of Iran's ambassador to the United Nations today after their marathon negotiations in Switzerland with several questions outstanding. Particularly problematic for President Barack Obama and his team are how quickly sanctions would be eased for Tehran in exchange for nuclear concessions, and how to snap economic restrictions back into place quickly if Iran is caught cheating. At a breakfast meeting with journalists, Moniz, a former MIT physics department head, provided some new detail on the combination of technical limits that the U.S. says would keep Iran at least a year away from assembling enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon for at least a decade. Hours after the framework was announced, the U.S. said Iran would be permitted to keep 6,104 centrifuges installed. Of these, a little more than 1,000 could be kept at Iran's deeply buried facility at Fordo that may be impervious to U.S. or Israeli air attack. None of those would be permitted to enrich uranium, material that can be used in a nuclear warhead. Moniz said no advanced centrifuges can be installed or developed at that site for 15 years. And in a new twist, he said only one-third of the 1,000 centrifuges there can actually 'spin' over that period. The rest will be 'just sitting there,' he said. The details are significant because they provide another piece of how American officials calculate that they'd have enough time to detect any Iranian push toward a bomb and respond. Tehran says its program is solely designed for energy, medical and research purposes, but Washington and many other governments distrust Iran's motives. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, center, and the committee's ranking member Ben Cardin, are seen here speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on the day their bill empowering Congress to review and potentially reject any Iran nuclear deal won approval of the panel. They must now win a battle in the full Senate with some colleagues determined to change the legislation in ways that could sink it . Nowhere does skepticism seem higher than on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are wrestling with how tough to make legislation on Iran that has gained the tacit approval of Obama. Proponents of the bill are trying to discourage any changes to the legislation. They recognize that politically driven amendments could undermine Democratic support and sink the carefully crafted measure. 'Anybody who monkeys with this bill is going to run into a buzz saw,' Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible White House candidate, warned ahead of this week's debate. Sherman, the State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, said if talks fail to produce a final deal, Iran would be two to three months from being able to produce enough material for a weapon. Speaking to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism in Washington, she said the president would reconsider support for the bill if it is distorted by amendments. 'There will be a lot of pretty awful amendments, quite frankly, and we'll see where we end up,' Sherman said. The bill was approved 19-0 by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It has 62 co-sponsors from both parties. The legislation would block Obama from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers weigh in. And it would stipulate that if senators disapprove the deal, Obama would lose authority to waive certain economic penalties \u2014 an event that would certainly prompt a presidential veto. Among proposed additions to the bill are demands that Iran release any U.S. citizens it is holding and refrain from any cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. Another insists that any agreement be treated as an international treaty, requiring two-thirds ratification by the Senate. Another set of amendments would block any sanctions relief for Iran until it meets goals the U.S. set years ago as negotiating stances and has long since abandoned. The bill must receive 66 votes in the Senate .",

        "article": "Neil Robertson revealed a new practice repertoire which he hopes will lift him among the game's all-time greats after storming into the second round of the Betfred World Championship. The 2010 champion rattled in an opening break of 133 as he reeled off the three frames required to turn a 7-2 lead into a 10-2 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones in Sheffield. Robertson has committed more hours to the game than ever before and he believes it will help him finally fulfil his potential and become a multiple winner of the sport's major crowns. Australia's Neil Robertson plays a shot during his  match against Wales's Jamie Jones at The Crucible . 'I have put in more hours for this tournament than any other in my whole career,' the 33-year-old Australian said. 'Before I played my first-round match I potted 300 balls without missing - that's the stuff (Stephen) Hendry used to do. Hendry used to not miss for six or seven frames, and that's what you have to do if you want to dominate matches. 'If you were to stop my career and look back, I would definitely have a feeling of 'what if I had practised more?'. I think I could do more so I've left no stone unturned coming into this tournament. 'It would be harsh to say I have under-achieved, but I think I could have won a lot more if I'd sacrificed a little bit more.' Barry Hawkins found himself the reluctant star of another Crucible epic after clinging on to beat qualifier Matthew Selt in a final-frame decider. The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. Robertson celebrates winning in his World Snooker Championship first round match against Wales's Jones . But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Hawkins - who fought off a similar fightback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals, admitted: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. 'There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. Robertson contemplates a shot during his World Snooker Championship first round match at The Crucible . 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Ding Junhui's dismal record at the Crucible looked set to continue as he lost the first four frames of his first-round match against veteran Mark Davis. The world number three looked distinctly out of sorts in the early stages, but clawed his way back to reduce the deficit to 3-4 overnight.",

There are only three countries in the entire world where you are more likely to have a female boss than a male boss. A study by US research firm, Expert Market, looking at data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\u00a0revealed that Jamaica is the country where you're most likely to have a female boss. Jamaica, Colombia and Saint Lucia, all relatively close to each other, have the highest percentage of female managers in the world . The world, organised and rated by the percentage of female bosses in the workforce . The Caribbean island had the world's highest percentage, at nearly 60 per cent. Out of the 108 world countries taken into consideration, Columbia was closely behind with 53.1 per cent of their managers being female, and in third place was another island, Saint Lucia, with 52.3 per cent. Closely following Jamaica at the top were the Phillipines at 47.6 per cent, as well as a series of other Latin America countries. Panama came in at fifth place and Guatemala was eighth while Eastern European countries were prevalent in the top ten, with Belarus sixth and Latvia coming in at seventh place. Britain (left) is a country where 34.2% of managers are women.\u00a0Much of the Middle East (right), as well as Pakistan were flagged in red as accounting for the lowest percentage of women in managerial positions . Britain ranked relatively poorly and came in at 41st place out of 108 of the surveyed countries, as only 34.2 per cent of managers are women. Although the UK surpassed countries such as Germany (31.1 per cent), Spain (30 per cent) and China (16.8 per cent), it lagged behind major economies such as France (39.4 per cent), Russia (39.1 per cent) and Australia (36.2 per cent). More surprisingly was that Britain, as a first-world country, fell behind developing regions such as Kazakhstan (which had 37.2 per cent female bosses) and Moldova (ranking at 44.1 per cent of managers being women). The United States was ranked within the top 20 countries in the world, at 15th place, as 42.7 per cent of all managers are female. Pakistan was ranked as the worst country in the world for having female managers, at a meagre three per cent. The other poorly ranking countries included Algeria (at 4.9 per cent) and Jordan (at 5.1 per cent). The United States of America (pictured in light green) are among the top 20 countries in the world for having a female boss, as 42.7% of all managers are female . Michael Horrocks, brand manager at Expert Market, commented: 'It is promising to see that in a growing number of regions around the world, women are increasingly entering management positions and playing a more important role in business strategy.' Although the survey also revealed that nearly a third of all businesses around the world are now owned or managed by women, even more disheartening is the number of CEOs in large companies.

        "article": "'The General':\u00a0Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for four years last April but faces ten more years if he does not pay back \u00a32.2m . A jailed tax fraudster who hid his wealth in the UK while building an estate  in Pakistan modelled on Buckingham Palace must pay back \u00a32.2million within six months or face a  ten more years in jail. Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for  four years last April after defrauding the taxman of \u00a3450,000. His nine-year scam was exposed after police raided his Birmingham home and discovered plans for his own mansion in Pakistan, complete with library, cinema and servant quarters. Serving inmate Khan faced a proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court last week and was ordered to pay \u00a32.2million within six months. If he fails to hand over the cash he faces a further ten years in prison. The tax fraudster had contested the order, brought by West Midlands Police and prosecuted at court by Andrew Smith\u00a0QC. Judge Andrew Menary QC presided over the week-long case, which heard details of Khan's complicated financial affairs. The original tax fraud court case heard how he had lived in a gated \u00a3500,000 house in Moseley and drove a BMW, but had no obvious job. His family home belonged to relatives and only small amounts of money went through his bank accounts. Yet while he was careful to avoid showing trappings of wealth in the UK, detectives from West Midlands Police's Force CID discovered he had secretly paid for the \u00a32.3million mansion to be built in Pakistan. In court his defence team portrayed him as a legitimate businessman who had earned around \u00a3400,000 over the nine-year period from debt collecting and other business interests in the UK and abroad. But police found no evidence of a legitimate debt collecting company and their investigation proved he had netted more than \u00a31million during that period, without paying the required tax and National Insurance. Inspiration: Khan built himself a vast estate in Pakistan, left, inspired by Buckingham Palace, right . A search of Khan's Birmingham home after his arrest uncovered plans for the 'palace' in the Attock region of Pakistan. The outer shell and roof of the building had been completed by Khan at a cost of \u00a3893,000. Once finished, the property would have been valued at \u00a32.3 million. Khan was known in criminal circles as 'The General' and his prosecution sent shockwaves around Birmingham's criminal fraternity, who had held him up to near 'mythical' status. One gangland source said: 'In recent years he was said to have turned religious but this man was still feared and his dealings and movements were shrouded in mystery. 'Not many people had even ever set eyes on him. He had this kind of mythical status where people only spoke his name in hushed tones. Most people referred to him simply as 'The General' which gave an indication of the kind of status he had in the community.' A police source close to the investigation into the unsolved murder of of Tony Yaqub in Birmingham in 2004 said: 'Khan was arrested after returning to Birmingham from Pakistan a few days after the murder and he was questioned at length'. Khan was later released without charge. An appeal was later made on the BBC\u2019s Crimewatch programme but Mr Yaqub\u2019s killers have continued to evade police and no motive for his murder has ever been revealed by police.",

        "article": "Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has sought to play down Neymar's petulant reaction when the Brazil forward was substituted in Saturday's 2-2 La Liga draw at Sevilla. Neymar, who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to Barca after Lionel Messi's opener, was clearly furious at being replaced by Xavi with around 20 minutes left and Spanish media speculated he might be dropped for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain. Luis Enrique declined to reveal who would start the match at the Parc des Princes but did make it clear that he was the one in charge and urged all his players to respect that. Luis Enrique has played down Neymar's angry reaction to be substituted against Sevilla . Neymar (left) speaks with Brazilian team-mates Adriano (centre) and   Rafinha during a training session . Barcelona face Chelsea' conquerors Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday in the Champions League . 'I haven't seen the footage,' Luis Enrique told reporters after he was asked about television images showing Neymar complaining to his team mates on the bench. 'As a coach I understand that all the players want to be on the pitch,' he added. 'And the players must understand that I am the coach and I have to make decisions. Beyond that you can speculate and draw the conclusions you want.' Asked again about Neymar's behaviour later in the news conference, Luis Enrique drew laughter by taking the chance to wish his mother a happy birthday. Luis Suarez (centre) and Gerard Pique joke around during the session at the Parcs des Princes Stadium . Messi (centre) takes part in a drill and the forward will need to be in top form to beat the French champions . Barca and PSG have already met twice in the Champions League group stage this term, with the Ligue 1 side winning 3-2 in Paris and Barca's 3-1 success at the Nou Camp helping them finish as pool winners. Barca are in the last eight of Europe's elite club competition for a record eighth season in a row, while PSG are seeking a last-four place for the second time, having lost to AC Milan in 1994-95 after beating Barca in the quarter-finals. PSG's hopes of making the semi-finals have been hit by suspensions and injury, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italy midfielder Marco Verratti banned and midfielder Thiago Motta out with a thigh injury. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner looks on as his Barcelona team-mates take part in a heading drill . Brazil centre back David Luiz has been sidelined with a hamstring problem, but has been included in the squad for Wednesday's match. 'Obviously they have some players missing, we cannot hide that, but if we remember the group game when Ibrahimovic wasn't playing they beat us,' Luis Enrique said. 'Then when Ibrahimovic was playing in Barcelona we were able to beat them. 'They are important players for them without doubt but they have a strong squad and for sure they will cause us problems.' The return leg is in Barcelona on April 21. Neymar (centre) controls the ball during a training session at the Parc des Princes stadium .",

        "article": "Angels slugger Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife two months ago - around the same time he admitted to an alcohol and drugs relapse, it has emerged. The divorce petition was filed in late February in Tarrant County, Texas, where Hamilton played five seasons with the Texas Rangers before moving to LA, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0reported. Hamilton, 33, married his wife Katie in 2004. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship and three more daughters with Hamilton. The petition doesn't detail the reasons for the split and only cites 'conflict'. Scroll down for video . Split: Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife, Katie, in late February, it has emerged. The filing comes after his self-reported relapse and just months after they celebrated 10 years together (pictured) Loved up: When he shared the above photo in November, he gushed about how much he loved his wife . In the petition, Hamilton outlined 34 requests. Among them, he called for his wife to be banned from using his Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer, the Dallas Morning News reported. He also requested she be prohibited from 'hiding' the children from him, from allowing men to stay the night while his children are home, and from making disparaging remarks about him or his family. But in March, Mrs Hamilton submitted a general denial to her husband's petition and this month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other throughout the case. Hamilton is not allowed to see his children without supervision, according to court records. He is also banned from going to the couple's properties in Westlake Texas; Newport Coast, California; and Valley Mills, Texas. Last week, the couple's six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home in Newport Coast went on the market for $16.5 million. The property has ocean views, an eight-car garage and a pool and spa, according to the\u00a0listing. Family: The couple has four daughters, including a 14-year-old (right) from Katie's former relationship. Hamilton is now not allowed to see the girls without supervision, according to court records . Split: The couple, pictured last year, have not listed the reasons behind their divorce, citing only 'conflict' Katie Hamilton, pictured with her oldest daughter, Julia, will appear on the upcoming 10th season of the Real Housewives of Orange County. She has custody of the couple's four daughters . The divorce petition comes just months after the couple celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary and Hamilton gushed about his wife on social media. '10 years ago today, I said \"I do\",' he wrote on his Twitter page on November 10 as he shared a photo of him and his wife. 'There are no words to describe how much I love and adore this lady.' Earlier this year, Hamilton, a former Major League Baseball Most Valued Player, underwent shoulder surgery before spring training for the LA Angels. He then self-reported that he had suffered a cocaine and alcohol relapse - the latest incident in his well-documented history of substance abuse. Hamilton was suspended for three seasons between 2003 and 2005 and was ordered to undergo regular drug testing when he was reinstated into baseball in 2005. After his recent relapse, Major League Baseball officials said Hamilton had violated his treatment program, but the players' association disagreed so an arbitrator was called to make a decision. Uncertain future: Hamilton, pictured in October 2014, signed with the LA Angels in 2012 but self-reported a substance abuse relapse earlier this year. He will not be disciplined but may not return to the team . Without divulging reasons, the arbitrator ruled that Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, and the player will not be disciplined for the relapse. After overcoming his early addiction problems, Hamilton played for the Texas Rangers between 2008 and 2012 and was named the AL MVP in 2010. During that time, he had two public relapses, including one before the 2012 season. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels, but owner Arte Moreno last week said he could not guarantee Hamilton will return to play for the team. He claimed that Hamilton's contract said the deal could be terminated if he relapsed. The Dallas Morning News reported that he was not assigned a locker during spring training and merchandise with his name on has been removed from the team's stadium store.",

        "article": "On Saturday, Rosetta swooped to within just 8.6 miles (14 km) of comet 67P's surface. During this close flyby, the probe was able to capture a stunning four image montage showing the two lobes of the icy comet in incredible detail. The top right frame offers a stunning view onto Hapi, the comet\u2019s \u2018neck\u2019 region that is littered with boulders. As part of the recent moves around comet 67P, Rosetta swooped to within about 8.6 miles (14 km) of the comet\u2019s surface on Saturday.\u00a0Its camera was able to capture a four image montage scale at this distance is 1.7 m/pixel showing the large lobe of the icy comet to the left and the small lobe to the right . The view also gives a detailed look at the numerous, curved markings visible on the smooth surface. In the same frame, details in the cliffs of Hathor can be seen, leading up to the \u2018head\u2019 of the comet\u2019s small lobe. The region towards the right of this frame shows the transition between this smooth, presumably dust-covered portion, and the layered, exposed cliffs below. The European Space Agency also recently released a trove ofimages captured by the Rosetta probe during its long journey to Comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This stunning scene was created from two Rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles (19.9 km) from the comet centre on 28 March. The scale is about 1.7 m/pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km . The top right frame offers a stunning view onto Hapi, the comet\u2019s \u2018neck\u2019 region littered with boulders.\u00a0The scale at this distance is 1.4 m/pixel . They include images of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting \u2018gravity assist manoeuvres\u2019 in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. As Rosetta makes an adventurous passes through the geysers of comet in the coming months, scientists hope to discover more information about the comet\u2019s interior from the jets. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. And with the comet becoming more active as it approaches the sun, these next few months are providing the best opportunity yet to study the comet - but it is not without risk. \u2018The comet is getting super exciting,\u2019 said Esa\u2019s Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor in The Times. \u2018Hundreds of kilos per second of material is flinging off it. We want to a do a fly-by through one of these active regions.\u2019 The probe will be brought within nine miles (15km) of the comet, with its path taking it right through 67P\u2019s geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. In so doing, though, the probe can become disorientated. It relies on seeing stars to know where it is, but the jets can obscure its view. This means that, occasionally, the spacecraft has to take evasive actions when it passes through a jet, to get itself into empty space and re-orientate itself relative to the stars. But studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet\u2019s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. The European Space Agency also recently released a trove of images captured by the Rosetta probe during its long journey to Comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Seen here is Rosetta's view of Earth on March 5th, 2005 . The latest images include ones of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting \u2018gravity assist manoeuvres\u2019 in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. Pictured is Mars as seen by Rosetta in 2007 . Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae\u2019s batteries and bring it back to life. Earlier in March scientists sent commands to the lander in the hope it would respond, but with no luck. On 14 April they will make another attempt to get in contact - and, if it stirs from its slumber, Philae will have a fantastic opportunity to study the comet as it reaches peak activity. Speaking about the most recent attempt to find the probe, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline: \u2018We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation. \u2018We don\u2019t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.\u2019 The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45\u00b0C (-49\u00b0F). But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power. It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won\u2019t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter. The next few months are certain to be an exciting time, though - not just for Philae, but for the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft as well.",

        "article": "A married software executive who drugged a female employee in order to take naked pictures of her on a business trip has been jailed. Sexual predator Henri Morris was told he would serve 10 years behind bars for his 'calculated and choreographed' crime. The 67-year-old was caught in an FBI sting after investigators were approached by one of his victims in 2012. Henri Morris, 67, was jailed for 10 years after admitting drugging a female employee during a business trip in order to take naked photos of her . She told them that her drink was spiked by the married businessman after they traveled together from Houston, Texas, to New Jersey for work. The woman said when she woke up she was naked and her boss was standing over her and taking pictures on his mobile phone. The FBI arrested Morris at Bush County Airport after the woman, who has not been named, covertly worked with them. When his bags were search they found his 'kit,' which included strong sedatives and Viagra. A task force was set up to probe Morris and in total they found eight female employees who claimed to have been abused by him. His defense team initially tried to argue that the women all willingly drank to excess with clients and that no abuse had ever occurred. Ahead of his trial Morris pleaded guilty to a single charge of drugging and abusing a female employee, in exchange for prosecutors dropping other abuse charges. MarriedMorris of Houston, Texas, was the president of Edible Software Solutions . 'There is no way to adequately express my remorse and my abject humiliation,' Morris said during a 10 minute address at his sentencing hearing, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'I apologize to anyone who I have hurt and beg for their forgiveness.' US District Judge Melinda Harmon sentenced him to 10 years in federal prison without the possibility of parole. She also reportedly ordered that he spend the rest of his life under the supervision of the US Bureau of Prisons, according to the newspaper.",

        "article": "A racegoer has been questioned by police after he was seen on video deliberately knocking an elderly man to the floor, who then needed to be taken to hospital. The man, who is seen unsteady on his feet and swaying after the day at the races in Aintree, barges into the 63-year-old who then stumbles backwards and falls to the floor in the middle of the road. The 34-year-old man, dressed in a suit, then walks off as people gasp and try to help the victim who was left lying on the floor. Scroll down for video . An Aintree racegoer is seen staggering towards an elderly man, before he barges into him and knocks him onto the floor into a road, leaving the man injured and lying on the floor as he walks off . He was later taken to hospital and treated for bruising on his face. Merseyside Police said the 34-year-old from Formby in Sefton came forward to police late last night and he was interviewed under caution about the alleged assault. He was released this morning pending further inquiries. The man was named on social media as a manager called Terry. Philip Dears, who took the video, posted on Facebook today: 'I have a 2 minute long video of my mate Terry drunk walking home from the races on Thursday, during which he staggers and accidentally bumps into an old man. The man falls and I'm filming the whole situation trying not to laugh. 'When I realise the seriousness of the situation the phone goes off, the laughing stops and I check on the old man, he is hurt on the floor but is being seen to by stewards awaiting medical attention. I turned my attention to Terry and wanted to make sure he gets home safety.' In the post Mr Dears said he and his wife phoned the hospital to check on the elderly man's condition. He also claims the video, which appears on YouTube, has been edited to make it appear the old man was deliberately targeted when this was not the case. The man stumbles backwards and falls, as the video is filmed by a sniggering friend of the alleged perpetrator . He added: 'When you see the video you will see this is a total accidental collision, it's important people get this truth because a lot of people are very upset and I can see why because it looks like a malicious, cowardly attack but this is far from the reality of the situation. ' The footage was brought to the attention of officers by members of the public who had shared it online. Police established the mobile phone footage, shot by a friend of the 34-year-old, was taken outside the racecourse on Thursday evening at about 7pm. He shouts to him 'text bomb' and 'is there any need?' moments before the incident happens as he sniggers uncontrollably from behind his phone. In the video, onlookers can be heard gasping in shock and seen rushing to the man's aid before calling for an ambulance. Officers said the man who was knocked to the floor is from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire. People have expressed their shock at the video. The 63-year-old man is seen standing on the pavement before the other man barges into him and knocks him . He becomes unsteady on his feet from the impact and begins to stumble, before he tumbles backwards . Gasps can be heard on the mobile phone footage as members of the public rush to help the injured man . Paul Hardman wrote: 'That video of the old man at Aintree\u00a0makes me sick to the stomach. Some absolute scum in this world.' Others labelled his behaviour 'disgusting' and 'vile.' Hayley Wills added: 'Hope that horrible man that knocked over the old chap at Aintree gets what he deserves, as well as the sick person that filmed it.' Merseyside Police earlier thanked visitors for making the annual race 'such a safe and enjoyable occasion' and said no arrests were made inside the ground over the three days. An online crowdfunding page has been set up to help the injured man.Concerned wellwishers have already raised \u00a3345 to help the pensioner with his recovery after Joanne Dickson saw Gary's response and launched the fundraising campaign. Page owner Joanne said: 'Most of us tonight have watched the horrible video of the gentleman being knocked to the ground. 'I'm hoping we can raise enough to maybe help him replace his teeth and his phone. 'I don't know the gentleman, I would just like him to know that most decent people are disgusted that, even if the knock was an accident, that no remorse was shown.'",

Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved, The West Australian reported. It's understood Mr Prabowo penned a letter to Mr Joko at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to 'postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto (right) that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved . Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was 'very sympathetic' to clemency. As well, he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. 'I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him, so I didn't,' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio. 'One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse, and I guess we'll never know.' This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr\u00a0Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The\u00a0Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and\u00a0announced\u00a0he would withdraw\u00a0Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts .",

        "article": "(CNN)Ursula Ward kept repeating her son's name -- Odin. She steadied herself against the podium in the Fall River, Massachusetts, courtroom and occasionally paused. She was tired after more than two years of pain, punctuated Wednesday when her son's killer, Aaron Hernandez, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Odin Lloyd was her first born, her only son. \"Odin was the backbone of the family. Odin was the man of the house. Odin was his sisters' keeper,\" Ward told Judge Susan Garsh, before Garsh sentenced the  former pro-football player. Lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in June 2013. He played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winner of four championships in the New England Football League, according to the team's website. His mother, sister, uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family, a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor. They said he rode his bike several miles to get to work. He went to all of his niece's recitals. \"Odin was my first best gift I (will) ever receive,\" his mother said. \"I thank God (for) every second and every day of my son's life that I spent with him. \"The day I laid my son Odin to rest,\" she continued, pausing to maintain her composure, \"I think my heart stopped beating for a moment. I felt like I wanted to go into that hole with my son, Odin.\" She can still hear him talking to her: \"'Ma, did you cook? Ma, go to bed. Ma, you're so beautiful.'\" Ed Lloyd followed Ward to address the judge. Odin Lloyd's uncle thanked everyone who worked on the case against Hernandez. His nephew, he said, \"meant a lot to me.\" \"To see how he grew, the respect he had, the toughest thing for me is that I won't get to see him have a child...,\" Ed Lloyd said. He loved watching his nephew and his son together. \"A lot of people won't see from the outside the value and the riches (Odin Lloyd) had,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for where I stand today but I know that all the time I had with him was special and he'll always be with me.\" Who was Odin Lloyd? Odin Lloyd's sister Olivia Thibou wept as she explained what it has felt like to lose her brother. \"These last couple years have been the hardest of our lives,\" she said, recalling that she was asked to writer her brother's eulogy.  \"I got to write all the great memories I have of him.\" She laughed, recalling his insistence on wearing the same Adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away. He was \"prideful,\" she said. He would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry, he'd pull in with the car shining and clean, inside and out. He taught her daughter how to ride a bike. His murder, she said, \"feels like a bad dream.\" Ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son. \"I miss my baby boy Odin so much,\" she said. \"But I know I'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on.\" She has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness. \"I forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son's murder,\" she said. \"I pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also.\" What's next for Aaron Hernandez?",

        "article": "(CNN)Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Three of the teens, all of them either 18 or 19, have since been released \"pending further enquiries,\" Australia's Federal Police said, but two remain in custody. Sevdet Besim, 18, has been charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The other suspect, a 19-year-old, has not yet appeared in court. \"Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired,\" said Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. \"The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,\" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the \"Daesh death cult,\" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men \"are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,\" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. \"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men,\" Gaughan said. \"And this is an issue not just with law enforcement, but for the broader community. ... We need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior, at the very early stage.\" The suspects were associates of 18-year-old Nadun Haider, who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in September, police said. Abbott lamented a string of extremist attacks on Australian soil. In December, Australian authorities stormed a Sydney chocolate cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages, killing the gunman. Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died. In February, two men were charged with plotting terror activities in Sydney. Despite distancing the suspects from religion, Abbott did make a connection to the Middle East. \"There are now about a hundred Australians who are fighting with terrorists in the Middle East,\" and another 150 people in Australia support them with funds and recruiting, the Prime Minister said. In February, Abbott announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government's new counterterrorism strategy. Authorities have suspended Australian passports of those they suspect of terrorist activity. Australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism, Abbott said Saturday. \"The best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is live your life normally.\" He asked Australians to turn out in droves on Anzac Day. Police said this particular threat had been fully contained.",
